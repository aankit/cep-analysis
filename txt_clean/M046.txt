The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Here at PS/MS 46 - The Arthur Tappan School, our goal is to provide our students with a world-class education. We  believe strongly in well-rounded curricula, which go beyond academics and promote the development of the whole  child. We work to seamlessly integrate and support each child’s social-emotional, physical, and academic needs into  everything we do. We believe that in a physically and emotionally safe environment, our students can meet and  exceed our high expectations for them.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our partnerships have widened, focusing on our school's goals of meeting the social-emotional needs, as well as the  academic needs, the physical needs, and the artistic needs of our students and families. Our partners include the  Morningside Center, Positive Behaviors Interventions and Supports (PBIS), Urban Advantage (UA) Science Initiatives  for Elementary and Middle Schools (Grades 3-8), Youth Touch Robotics, Sports and Arts Foundation, CHAMPS for  Elementary and Middle School students, Middle School College Access for All, Reading Rescue (for identified at-risk  students in Grade 1), and the Lang Lang Foundation continues to support our Piano Lab.    We continue to focus on STEM-based learning opportunities: coding for students in Grades 3 to 8; Lego Robotics in  Grades 5 to 8; and after-school enrichment in Coding for Grades 4 and 5. In the upcoming school year, our  departmentalized math teachers in Grades 5 through 8 are part of the Algebra for All Cohort 2. In addition, all of our  teachers and departmentalized writing teachers in Grades Kindergarten to Grade 8 will participate in the Teachers  College Writing Initiative. Our elementary school students in Grades Kindergarten to 5 will have after-school  enrichment opportunities with the programming offered through the 21st Century Community School grant. Through  the grant, students in Grades Kindergarten to Grades 2 will be offered wellness options to support our mental health  needs.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Increasingly, we have a small population of approximately less than 1% of our student body with mental health  concerns. We are working with our external partners, Harlem Renaissance Clinic and Columbia Presbyterian Hospital,  to provide more supports to address those students and their families' well-being, as well as their peers who witness  some of the exhibited behaviors. Second Steps and Restorative Practices not only support students in terms of  character development, but also address students' basic psychological needs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school is adopting the Optimal Learning Framework. One of the three Domains is Create Emotionally,  Intellectually, and Physical Safe Environments. From that Domain, we have been working on and continue to work on  Positive Relationships that are Kind, Caring, and Respectful and Focus on Effort, Supported Risk-taking, and Growth.  We have calibrated our community's behavioral expectations around conduct, manner of communication, respectful  interactions, and dress code. Putting supports such as the Second Steps character education curriculum, Positive  Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), and 4Rs--Reading, Writing, Respect, and Resolution--helped our school  community to establish a more Supportive Environment.    Through our work with Lesson Study, our Collaborative Teachers continue to embed the standards into our curricula;  refine their practice to meet the needs of our students through targeted classroom instruction; and actively  participate in their Grade and Department Team meetings.

On the 2016-2017 Quality Review, our rating in QR Indicator 1.1 (Curriculum) was Proficient. Our teachers worked and  continue to work to align and pace each grade's English Language Arts and Math curricula to the Common Core Learning  Standards. (Further alignment will continue with the adoption of the new standards.) Additionally, our school  community aligned the Focus and Power Standards, designated as such from standards that our students were under- performing on from the 2016 June Instructional Reports, to their units of study. Based on the Automate the System  (ATS) report entitled Report Academic Student Performance (RASP), there was an overall student performance  improvement in the testing grades (3 to 8) with a 18.64% decrease of students in Level 1 in English Language Arts and  a decrease of 32.8% in Level 1 students in mathematics from the 2015-2016 school year to the 2016-2017 school year.    However, in QR Indicators 1.2 (Pedagogy) and 1.3 (Leveraging Resources), our ratings were Developing. Through weekly  Grade and/or Department Team meetings, Lesson Study has been leveraged to increase pedagogy and pedagogical  decision-making. With departmentalization, in the upcoming school year, of Grades 1 to 5, there will be a weekly  department meetings across grade bands, K-2, 3-5, and 6-8, in the following areas: Reading, Writing, Mathematics,  Science, and Social Studies.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      Our students' responses on the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey spoke to their lack of challenging work in  their classrooms. Our instruction will be enriched utilizing Karen Hess' Rigor Matrices for Reading, Writing, Math,  Science, Social Studies, and so on. Varying our tasks to challenge our high-performing, approaching standards, and at- risk students will support students' access to rigorous instruction.    Additionally, our assessment focus will be geared towards summative student assessment. Teachers will utilize a data  tracking template in Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies for each student to track his or her  progress toward subject-area mastery in real-instructional-time. Analysis of student data will allow teachers to make  adjustments to their pedagogy. Lesson Study will help support teachers in instructional adjustments, as well as targeted  professional development offered through consultants.

Over the course of two years, our school community has shown improvements in the element of Supportive  Environment. As stated above, our learning environment normed expectations around conduct. From the Framework  for Great Schools, in the element of Trust, there has been a 0.79 improvement in the rating score for the 2016-2017  school year from the 2015-2016 school year. This was also reflected in our school's 2016-2017 Quality Review, in  which the Component 1.4 (Maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults) was rated Well Developed. Based on the New York City Department of  Education Online Occurrences Reporting System (OORS), there has been a 15% drop in the number of school-wide  infractions from 2015-2016 to 2016-2017. This, we can attribute to a holistic approach to progressive discipline.  Adults and students learn strategies for self-regulating and appropriate decision-making from their work with Second  Steps, 4Rs--Reading, Writing, Respect, and Resolution, and Positive Behavior Inventions and Supports (PBIS).    Based on the School Quality Guide, the school will continue to target classroom behaviors. Student responses,  according to the School Quality Guide in the area of Classroom Behavior, indicated a 60% positive score in the 2016- 2017 school year. Our target was 45% of our students will treat each other with respect. Based on our results, there  was a 50% improvement over last year's, we will continue to address this component in our school community.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           19      Students and classes of students will be incentivized to be better citizens of our school community through PBIS and  the PBIS Shop called the Tiger's Den.    PBIS will be a school-wide program for all students in Grades Kindergarten to 8 this school year. Last year, it was  piloted in Grades 3 through 5. Students will earn points when they demonstrate characteristics from our PBIS ROAR-- Respect, Organization, Accountability, and Responsibility--matrix.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  By the end of the previous school year, we started actively recruiting certified, licensed teachers to work with our  students. We partnered with the Office of Teacher Recruitment in May and June 2017 to develop our interviewing  processes, which included a rubric for selecting great candidates. Teachers in our school work in their license area, as  well as in departments that showcase their content knowledge. New teachers are assigned a mentor teacher and will  be given the opportunity to meet monthly as a new teacher team with administration. Administration along with  teachers will have the opportunity to attend Professional Development outside of the school building. Teachers will  meet weekly with their Department teams. Feedback from observations will be timely and include specific next steps.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Through a grant, from the New Teacher Center (NTC), carefully selected veteran staff will work closely with our eight  new teachers. This is a two-year program geared to support our first and second year teachers. Through low- inference observations of their practice by their mentors, our teachers will get constructive feedback to improve their  pedagogy. New teachers will also work with a veteran pedagogue, outside of their assigned NTC mentor. The  Administrative Team will also meet with our new teachers once a month.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  We provide workshops to our Pre-Kindergarten parents and the parents of children who will be attending our  Kindergarten program, by facilitating an Open House and workshops on the application process and transitioning to  the next grade. Prior to the start of the school year, the last week in August, we contact incoming parents and  students for a Meet and Greet to discuss expectations. Teachers in Pre-K and Kindergarten have the opportunity to  work together and collaborate with one another about the curriculum throughout the school year. During the turning  five evaluations a Kindergarten teacher will be present. We continue to foster a closer relationship with the local  nursery program, Children's Village, by affording opportunities for future students and their parents to visit our  school.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Instructional cabinet will meet Monthly to make school-wide decisions, which include exploring curriculum,  choosing assessments and creating school wide professional development opportunities. Each grade team will use the  inquiry cycle focusing in on four students from the grade for six weeks. Additionally the instructional cabinet will  examine exit slips teachers fill out after Professional Development opportunities in order to revise professional  development objectives. Through feedback and next steps using the Danielson Framework from the Administrative  Team, teachers will look more closely at formative and summative data to inform their instructional practice. On an  ongoing basis, the Administrative Team will hold Teacher and Student Data Talks to discuss the evidence of their  instructional assessment data and their impact on student outcomes.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           42     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds   must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant  application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  P.S./M.S. 46 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating  and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Arthur Tappan School - PS/MS 46 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Our goal is to enrich the learning opportunities of our elementary school students in Grades Kindergarten to Grade 5.  the specific focus is to provide experiences that improve their social-emotional and physical development.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2018, 92% of our participating students will attend the program full-time, which will positively impact the  school's attendance to 92%.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  The program is meant to provide richer extra-curricular experiences for students who are traditionally school- dependent. By providing our families with after-school academic supports, field trips, and a variety of physical  activities, our elementary students will have more well-rounded experiences before Middle School.         Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      3.   4.   Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   Our Sports and Arts Foundation (SASF) Director is a member of the school's School Leadership Team for the past two  years because SASF has been the Middle School Initiative provider. The Director and the Principal meets bi-monthly  to set goals and address concerns. The Director facilitates programming during the lunch periods for Grades 6 to 8.  The SASF Team has built interpersonal relationships with our families and are often involved in parent meetings.         Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 4a.

The program will be open to MS students, with a targeted outreach for those students  who did not meet necessary gains on the 2017-2018 NYSESLAT exam. The program will be  taught by our ESL teacher, with students in the Middle School. The program will take place  Wednesday through Friday from 2:30pm to 4:30pm and will run from October to May  totaling 83 sessions. Target class size is 30 students.  Materials will include ELA readers, Oxford Picture Dictionaries, as well as access to the app  Fluent U via iPads previously purchashed.  ESL students enrolled in  the after-school program will enjoy further academic supports through  the purchase of added supplies and materials with Title III allocated funds. The use of  Starfall will allow our students a more interactive, computer-based supplemental program, while  the Reading Horizons curriculum provides a more traditional, targeted supplement.  Any materials purchased with Title III funds will be used solely for the purpose of the program.  Any additional monies needed to implement the program will be used from other funding  sources.

To help train staff in practical strategies to support our ESL students, our ESL teachers will be  conducting 8 Lunch and Learn workshops over the course of the year. These workshops will  begin in October and run through May.  The duration of each workshop will be 45 minutes and  will cover actionable strategies that can be implanted immediately to support ESL students.  This  discussion will be centered on the book “Fifty Strategies for Teaching English Language  Learners.”  Our school began work on this book last year.  Further professional development will help train teachers in becoming more sensitive to the  cultural and educational needs of our English language learners and to encourage our students to  embrace multiculturalism.  This professsional development will center on the Scholastic  Multiculturalism in the Classroom curriculum available via the Scholastic website.  Additionally, in a continuation of professional development from previous years, our ESL  teachers will attend the district sponsored interdisciplinary unit planning professional  development series that runs from November to May.  This series culminates in a multi-cultural  celebration and presentation of collaboratively planned units and projects.   Materials:  We will use the book “Fifty Strategies for Teaching English Language Learners” by Adrienne  Herrell.    ESL teachers will highlight strategies and chapters during monthly Lunch and Learns. We will  assess the effectiveness of the PD by observing improved classroom practices and student scores  of in-house and state assessments.

Just as challenging curriculum  or engaging teachers can spur authentic learning for our students, parents/guardians undoubtedly  represent an essential part of a student’s everyday learning. With an open door policy, continued  articulation, and parental support, PS/MS 46 will meet the demands of our ESL instructional  program.  Based on information gathered from our parent organizations, workshops will be developed to  meet the needs of our ELL parents. Workshops will be geared to the specific needs requested by  parents.  With the support of our parent coordinator, data is collected from parents with regards  to what workshops and trainings parents would like to see at our school, such as health related  topics, ESL classes, how to assist children at home with homework, and how to foster the use of  native language use at home in order to improve their English language skills.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We currently use Fountas and Pinnell to assess the reading level of our ELLs six times throughout the school year.  Unit exams  for teachers are created via Schoolnet so that results can be analyzed.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All student reading levels are tracked via a shared Google Doc so that all staff can analyze trends in student reading  levels.  Teachers generate Schoolnet answer documents to provide actionable data tied to Common Core standards.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We also use the NYC BOY Performance Tasks and NYC EOY Performance Tasks in Math and ELA to provide data to guide our  instructional planning.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Performance Task data is shared with staff via Schoolnet so that teachers can identify areas of strength and weakness and  subsequently provide targeted instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   After an analysis of Fountas and Pinell data in conjunction with baseline NYC Performance Data, specific student  needs are identified so that teachers can provide support in appropriate areas using appropriate methods. For  Response to Intervention (RtI), the top 15% of the lowest one-third of our student population are identified and given  targeted support by specific teachers in 6 week cycles.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     ESL team analyzes trends in NYSESLAT and ELA & Math state test scores to determine both programmatic and  instructional necessities. These findings are then shared with administration to determine future course offerings and  curriculum initiatives. The ESL Team utilize the EDAT to provide targeted instruction based on students' identified  deficits and areas of strength. Both ESL Teachers provide targeted support for our top 15% of our struggling students.    c.  DL program.

Based upon this data analysis, teachers and other staff can make recommendations to the ESL team about  supports needed and suggestions for moving forward.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Each grade has a section which consists of the grade's ENL students mixed with non ENL students. This model allows for  students from Entering to Expanding  to receive ENL instruction, in an instructional format similar to the integrated co- teaching model found in special education classrooms. Stand alone instruction is provided to Entering and Emerging students  via a rotation of pull-out services. We have one certified ESL teacher that services Grades K-3 students and one certified  ESL teacher that services Grades 4-8. These teachers are responsible for integrated and stand alone instruction for their  respective grades.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.              4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?              5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Students are grouped according to grade band and level to ensure the required number of integrated instructional minutes are  achieved, as dictated by the Part 154. This translates to the following instructional times for students who are Entering  (approximately 4 periods per week), Emergent (approximately 4 periods per week), Transitioning (approximately 2 periods per  week) and Expanding (approximately 4 periods per week). Similarly, students are grouped in bands of no more than two  grades and organized into groups based on level for stand alone services, ensuring that the instructional minutes are met for  Entering (approximately 4 periods per week) and Emerging (approximately 2 periods per week) Students.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   With regards to the integrated model, curriculum is shared with the ENL teacher at least two weeks in advance so that she/he  can create adequate differentiation strategies to best support our ENL students. The school-wide literacy curriculum supports  ENL students and teachers are fully expected to engage all of our students with the curriculum. Additional reading supports are  provided in the form of close reading strategies, such as chunking text, front-loading some of the academic vocabulary, and so  on. Teachers ensure that students work in partners to express their ideas and actively listening with their peers. In both the  integrated and stand alone models, teachers are discouraged from using transmission-based approaches. The goal is for ENL  students to be provided the same opportunity to learn challenging content as their non-ENL peers.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      Because over 75% of our ELLs are Spanish speaking, our ELL teachers are also native Spanish speakers. This allows them to  design appropriate assessments for those students to be evaluated in their home languages. For those students that are not  Spanish speakers, we receive support from translation services such as the Big Word to support in the creation and  administration of home language assessments. Progress on end of unit curricular assessments is used to track academic  achievement.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  A - SIFE students receive extensive RtI via the stand alone model.  Specific RTI supports are determined from data gathered via  Fountas and Pinnell assessments and NYC Performance tasks.    B - Entering students also receive RTI services in addition to mandated ENL services. This support is tied to relevant student  data. Opportunities for targeted instruction occur during one teacher preparation period each week.   C - Emerging students receive both integrated and stand alone services with an emphasis on working in collaborative  environments to foster a more natural form of language acquisition as well as opportunities for critical thinking. Opportunities  for targeted instruction occur during one teacher preparation period each week.  D - Long term ELLs largely receive integrated ELL services with targeted instruction tied largely to NYSESLAT standards.  Many  of these students also have IEPs and receive SETSS services.  E - Former ELLs are placed in integrated classes and receive targeted support in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking  based on teacher data.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Teachers are instructed to provide accessible reading materials. An emphasis is placed on text-chunking and using websites  such as NEWSELA where materials can be printed about the same content at varying reading levels. Teachers provide  appropriate structures and protocols to foster collaborative environments and encourage students to have authentic, content  related conversations. During common planning department and grade team meeting times, teachers have opportunities to  present their students' work samples for discussion, feedback, and suggestions for improved instruction.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   ELL-SWDs are largely placed in an ICT setting with planning support from our ELL team.  Those ELL-SWDs that are in a self- contained setting receive a combination of stand alone and integrated services.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Opportunities for targeted instruction occur during one teacher preparation period each week. Teachers are instructed to  provide accessible reading materials. An emphasis is placed on text-chunking and using websites such as NEWSELA where  materials can be printed about the same content at varying reading levels.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Based on our Middle School trends, we focus targeted instructional groups based on areas of deficits on the NYSESLAT.  Targeted instruction for groups of students who struggle with the speaking section would be in one group, listening in another  group, and so on. This service would be in addition to mandated ENL services and involves dually certified ENL teachers, not  currently teaching ENL.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?              14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         While priority is given to certain groups of students, through our 21st Century Community School grant, awarded for the 2017- 2018 school year, over the next five years, we are able to provide extra-curricular after school opportunities for 300 students  in Grades Kindergarten to 5. The staggering of our after school and Saturday programs allows our ELLs access to the plethora  of after school activities we have in our school community. Scheduling is staggered by grade band to ensure all students  receive an equal amount of time. These programs run from September to June, from Wednesday to Friday, the time is 2:30- 5:30. Middle School students attend after school Monday through Friday, from 2:30 to 5:30 PM, through the Middle School  Initiative. On Saturdays students meet from 10:00-2:00. Students can attend ELL after school and then attend, Dance, Piano,  Chorus, Basketball, or any other activity offered either in-house or via our partnership with the Sports and Arts Foundation and  Asphalt Green.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ENL classrooms have their own set of laptops to ensure access to technology. Classrooms are equipped with Promethean or  SMART Boards in order to give students visual supports as they learn concepts. The curricular resources/images displayed on  the boards have language features that translate different words to over 15 different home languages. Teachers are  encouraged to use the reading website myOn, which allows students to read books online and adjusts based on student  reading levels and in their home languages. At the completion of each book, students answer a series of questions which  gauges comprehension and vocabulary acquisition and then suggests books based on levels. Students have access to this  resource from any Android, Google, or IOS smart device. The school utilizes school-wide Apps that have translation features to  support our students and families.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students are encouraged to engage in all content in their home languages with the support of their peers.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All schedules are crafted by the administration according to necessary requirements, using a software-based scheduling  application. This information is then passed along to the school STARS programmer who checks to ensure students are  appropriately programmed. This is then passed along to the ENL Team to check yet again to ensure students are receiving  appropriate services.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We are not a co-located school.            Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Immediately upon entering our building, ELLs and their families are introduced to our ELL team and corresponding Assistant  Principal based on grade.  From there, the ELL team assigns each ELL student a "buddy student" to support them through the  transition.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  For the coming school year, only Spanish will be offered.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?                  2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We ensure our ELL teachers attend all mandated professional development opportunities provided by our field support offices,  as well as the district office. We also strongly encourage the team to attend optional professional development opportunities  be providing class coverages whenever needed and any additional supports. We work closely with our ELL contact at the  Superintendents office, who we meet with on a monthly basis.  For the coming school year the ELL team will engage with the  Pauline Gibbons book, "English Learners, Academic Literacy, and Thinking.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Of the approximately 4 Mondays each month, one per month is dedicated exclusively to ELL professional development. This PD is  provided by a combination of Administrators, District staff, ELL teachers, and consultants. Although grade dependent, the  upcoming school year's focus are on Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, Vocabulary, Fluency, and/or Comprehension. Our Google  platform tracks topics discussed and next steps for instruction.                                      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64                 Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, The ENL team schedules rotating meetings with parents during the mandated  parent outreach time on Tuesday afternoons.  During this time, the team meets with parents, has  conference calls with parents, or crafts a newsletter geared towards our ENL parents. During these  meetings, the topics range based on deficits we noticed in our data. , testify that the following ELL identification  procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.   The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65                 2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School  Name:      The  ENL  team  is  expected  to  hold  a  monthly  parent  engagement  activity  that  brings  our  ELL  community  together.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our school uses multiple data points to assess the language preferences of our parent community for both written  and oral communication. We analyze the Home Language Identification Survey, ATS entries, and student  emergency contact cards to provide us with information as to our families' preferred language of communication.  Also, teachers survey their class and their parent(s) and/or guardian(s) in the beginning of the year to determine  their preferred language.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral                Language    The preferred languages  for written and/or oral  communication are  Spanish and English.    All of the languages spoken  in the school community  include English, Spanish,  Arabic, French, Soninke,  Fulani, Twi, and Malinke.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   Families       The following documents are  disseminated throughout the school  year: a Parent Handbook, student  contracts, monthly newsletter, monthly  calendars, announcements, fliers, after  school/enrichment programs, testing  dates, parent workshops and meetings,  letters, and so on.            How do you plan to translate?  Include procedures to ensure  timely provision of translated   documents to parents.       2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   interpretation service(s)?          Our school offers multiple  opportunities to meet with families  face-to-face throughout the year.  Some of those face-to-face events  include Tuesday's Family Engagement  time, open school nighs, student-led  parent-teacher conferences, IEP  meetings, disciplinary and attendance  meetings, assemblies, and so on.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services by ensuring that  the aforementioned checklist of notification requirement is current and complete.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parents surveys are utilized throught the year to monitor the spoken and written languages, as well as to get feedback  about current and available services.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70
