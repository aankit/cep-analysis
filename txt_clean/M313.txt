This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   “ It is our mission... at the James Baldwin School, to provide a haven for students who have previously experienced  school as unresponsive to their needs as individuals. We wish for all students to find their voice and to speak  knowledgeably and thoughtfully on issues that concern their school, their world. We aid students in this endeavor by  personalizing our learning situations, by democratizing and humanizing the school environment”      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our Core Values    Commitment to Peace    Commitment to Justice    Commitment to Democracy    Respect for Humanity    Respect for Diversity    Respect for the Truth    Respect for the Intellect      The James Baldwin School (JBS) is partnered with the New York Performance Standards Consortium (and offers PBATs  in place of most Regents exams. Consortium Performance Indicators have informed the shared understanding of  effective instruction among JBS staff. PBATs are rigorous products that require higher order thinking, reading, writing  and presentation skills. To successfully complete a PBAT, students must support arguments with text-based evidence,  conduct substantial research synthesizing multiple primary and secondary sources, design experiments, debate issues  of historical significance, and more. PBATs are authentic tasks based on engaging, real-world questions that allow  students to explore issues that are relevant, complex, and challenging.    JBS is also partnered with NYC Outward Bound Schools and uses their curricular model of EL. EL’s Core Practices  promote instructional skills such as “Planning Effective Lessons”, “Structuring Revision and Critique” and “Ongoing  Assessment” among many others. These skills, aligned with both the Danielson rubric and the CCLS, inform the shared  understanding of effective instruction at JBS. JBS teachers all develop learning targets for courses, which are  developed from these common sources of instructional vision: the common PBAT rubrics, the EL Core Practices, and  the CCLS.    As a transfer school, it is essential that we provide an alternative to traditional schools and attend to socio-emotional  learning. Therefore, effective instruction at JBS must reach all students where they are, provide multiple points of  entry into both content and skills, and build on student strengths. We must provide high-quality supports across all  classrooms, promote student choice, and differentiate as needed so that all students can be successful.   The staff collaboratively developed a menu of JBS Common Practices and indicated a commitment to making them  consistent across all classrooms. This menu, aligned with the Danielson rubric, has driven the professional  development plan and goal setting this year. Every Monday, teachers engage in 75 minutes of PD focused on these  instructional practices. The PD approach is to:       1. Establish a process in which teachers collaborate in understanding the best practices related to these common  practices; implement them in classrooms/Crews; get feedback from peers, supervisors, and coaches; and bring them  back for reflection and refinement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      2. Build upon best practices such that instruction, and student learning, is consistently strong across the school.   3. Build more common language and understanding of these practices, especially as linked to the EL Core Practices   4. Provide a balance between whole group learning and differentiated small group learning.         The JBS Common Practices were developed to allow students to better understand what is being asked of them and  support them towards improved attendance and academic success in each particular class and academic discipline.  They align with the Danielson rubric, specifically 2b) Establishing a Culture for Learning, 2c) Managing Classroom  Procedures, 3a) Communicating with Students, 3b) Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, and 3d) Using  Assessment in Instruction. We also know that consistency across classrooms is an important step in providing a safe  and productive environment for students, especially for transfer students in an environment with high mobility.  Therefore, our goal focuses not only on improving teacher facility with the practices but also to making those  practices more consistent across classrooms.   During Initial Planning Conferences, each teacher agreed with their supervisor on 2-4 components from the Danielson  framework that they wanted to emphasize during the observation cycle. All teachers selected the PROSE option which  emphasizes inter-visitation. In addition to a whole staff expectation of consistency with the JBS Core Practices as  evidenced through supervisory observations, each teacher also expects feedback in their selected Danielson-aligned  EL components from colleagues through inter-visitation and departmental Looking at Student Work (LASW) protocols.  They also participate in the Consortium’s moderation studies to ensure final student products are peer-reviewed.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We serve transfer high school students, many of whom are over-age and under-credited. We also serve students with  IEPs and ENL students. Our students have often had spotty attendance and negative experiences with school and  come to us needing extra social and emotional support and a very different experience than the ones that have  previously not set them up to be successful in high school. They need strong relationships with school staff, regular  and ongoing attendance feedback, mental health and/or substance use counseling, engaging curriculum, and deep  community-building, Our school provides students with needed choice and personalization through our advisory  called Crew and unique course catalogue. We provide significant socio-emotional support through our Community  Support Team and Attendance Team.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The two areas that demonstrate the most progress this past year are Supportive Environment and Collaborative  Teachers. Areas of focus for the coming year are Family and Community Ties and Effective School Leadership.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M313   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   258   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Our needs assessment from teacher survey results from SY18 revealed that all teachers wanted more time to plan and  co-plan and to learn about effective research-based models of co-teaching.   This year, more than half of all academic classes are co-taught, and many additional ones have student teachers. This  is a strength in our program. However, finding time and models for effective co-teaching and co-planning has been a  challenge.    While we have high success rates with many students with IEPs, there is a consistent group that under-perform as per  School Snapshot. This sub-group will be a focus for the impact of our co-teaching work this school year.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Schools with stable leadership promote improved student performance. Involving students in leadership and  governance will strengthen school culture. Though school culture is strong as per previous QRs and PPOs, student and  parent surveys from SY18 indicate that students and parents in general would like to be more involved in decision- making at the school. Increasing the agency of the SLT and using the SLT to provide a lens on leadership at the school  would improve school culture even more.   Areas of strength   ● Explicit decision-making structures promote clear and democratic processes   ● Teachers have several different formal and informal leadership roles   ● Team structures promote collaborative and distributive leadership   Areas for growth   ● Further develop leadership and group facilitation skills among teachers      Further clarify roles and responsibilities of members of the JBS Leadership Team        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs.

Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The James Baldwin School, in compliance with ESSA, is responsible for creating  and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The James Baldwin School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., student proficiency  levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey  Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   1. The James Baldwin School operates at the high school level. We do not explicitly test for early literacy skills with a specific  assessment tool. However, during the interview process to attend our school, students meet with the ESL teacher, Shelly  October and have a small oral conversation so that she can gauge speaking proficiency. Then, students proceed to write a one  page essay on the day of the interview and finally students are asked to read an excerpt from James Baldwin with the  interview committee. We use this information as a way to holistically gauge student assessment.     Insights the data provides about our ELLs is that they are coming to us with low reading and writing skills.  We help to build these skills through the PBAT process and direct intervention with the ESL teacher.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   All ELLs are interviewed at intake and programmed for additional supports as needed/mandated. Data provided by FSC is  reviewed weekly to ensure compliance. ENL students are programmed for ENL advisory.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We are an ESL Freestanding Program Only. Our past and current ELLs receive credit for their classes at an appropriate rate and  they are passing the Regents Exam/Performance Based Assessments to make them on track for graduation.      The assessment tool used is the ELA Regents exam and the Performance Based Assessments.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students who do not pass the ELA Regents or the PBATs are programmed to re-take the courses that prepare them.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].         Looking at the proficiency data, it seems that students fair relatively well with the listening and speaking NYSESLAT modality,  but seem to struggle in the reading and writing modality, although most students are at the transitioning or expanding level.     None of our students took the NYSITELL     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At least one full staff meeting per term is dedicated to sharing best practices and accommodations for ENL students so all gen  ed teachers are aware of how to best serve the ENL students they see that term.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   A. To service our ELL's we use a push-in model where Natalie Soto, our ESL certified pedagogue co-teaches with other  teachers.  Our teachers are all currently teaching within license area, and thus our ELL students are enrolled in English  classes taught by English certified teachers but targeted for ELLs and other students with below standard reading and  writing skills; Shelly October, a dual certified ELL and English teacher facilitates an ELL advisory where she meets with  ELLs 4 times a week. In addition, Shelly October co-teaches a US history class for H5/H7 credit  and two single credit  ELA Regents Preparation classes where ELL students were programmed into her class.     In addition to the ELA Regents Examination and RCTs, and periodic assessments, we incorporate a new reading  diagnostic for students as part of the admissions process.   Future professional development will be designed to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         expose teachers to rubrics used in this assessment and to inform teachers of how to interpret results as they design  literacy teaching strategies for the classroom.      We have a freestanding ESL model.     B.  Our program model is block scheduling where each academic class meets four times a week.   This year, we have  continued to push to support ELL students in other content areas. Natalie Soto, the ELL teacher is currently co  teaching an ELL inclusion American History course where students meet for 360 minutes a week.     In addition, she is teaching two afternoon English regents inclusion course that meets for 200 minutes a week.     Much like the prior year, our ESL teacher has an advisory that meets for 180 minutes a week. In this class, students  are focused academically on reading, writing, listening, speaking. One day is focused on strategies towards college  preparation in concordance with the common core standards.     The James Baldwin School has changed the schedule into longer blocks in the morning to provide more minutes for  ELL students.  All of our classes except advisory is heterogenously grouped.                  b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      We are a freestanding program only.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We are a freestanding program only.     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All of our ELL's are provided with the mandated number of minutes  of ESL services.   We have 6 students that are  provided with 360 minutes of ESL services a week and 9 advanced students that are provided with 180 minutes of ELA and 180  minutes of ESL services.   Once students are identified, they are programmed into classes according to their proficiency level  and mandated minutes. For example, if an intermediate student needs 360 minutes a week, that student will receive priority  programming for a 90 minute push-in content area class which meets 4 times a week.  An advanced student receives priority programming for a push-in 50 minute content area class that meets 4 times a week.  That same student also is programmed into a 50-minute English Language Arts class that meets for 50 minutes – 4 x a week.     In other words, all ELL students receive priority programming and program decisions are recommended and enforced by the  ESL teacher.             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      For our push-in model, the content area changes. Currently the 2 credit push in classes are the social studies class and 2 - 50  minute ELA Regents Prep classes. In the next semester, the 2 credit content area for push in will be in English Language arts  which meets for 360 minutes a week. In the school year 2014-2015, 1 full year was dedicated to a 2-credit push in social  studies class, science, math and English language arts, which included Regents Preparation explicitly. All classes have been  aligned to the common core learning standards.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         The ESL teacher is also dually licensed in English Language Arts. Therefore, in the Spring semster, the ESL teacher will coteach  English Language arts in the upcoming semester.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are assessed in their native language in a number of ways. The ESL teacher has a bilingual dictionary for every  primary language spoken by students. Students are given these dictionaries during class exams and class activities. In addition,  there is a teacher on staff that speaks the native language for every student except for Arabic. In that instance, when  communicating with families, the DOE translation is utilized for conferences and/or other activities.  For the Spanish speaking  students, they have taken the Spanish Regents exam which confirms literacy in their native language as well.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At the James Baldwin School, we currently have 2 designated SIFE students.  In previous years, as a way to increase their time  with the ESL teacher, each SIFE student receives more than the required 360 minutes of ESL instruction. We find extra time  with the ESL teacher in content areas helps these students further their proficiency level with English. In addition, these  students were programmed into classes where there are two teachers available for the remaining classes that the ESL teacher  is unavailable. These students are also placed with the ESL teacher on Wednesdays where the ESL teacher works with students  in order to reinforce other class work that students have trouble with understanding. This class met once a week on  Wednesdays for 40 minutes.     Newcomers follow the same approach listed above for SIFE students. In addition, more frequent checkins with the ESL teacher  about their learning and adjustment is built into the program through advisory.     Students who have 4-6 years of service are encouraged to work on their area of weakness on the NYSESLAT. According to our  data, students are mostly having difficulty with reading and writing more than speaking and listening. As a result, students  have more English classes to work on this area. Two students who exhibit weakness in reading and writing are in a scaffolded  English Regents Prep class with two teachers that focuses solely on reading and writing about non fiction information.     We use the same type of intervention for students who have more than 6 years of service. The ultimate goal is for them to be  in general education. We attempt to target the weakness area and work on it. We have been pleased with this method so far  as students are becoming proficient from the NYSESLAT exam as well as graduating at a rate comparable or better than  general education students.     After students have become proficient as a result of the previous year's NYSESLAT, we program each student into classes with  the ESL teacher to ensure further services in English as a second language. At times, if there is space in advisory, that student  also is programmed into an ESL advisory. These student types additionally receive priority programming in classes where two  teachers are available.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Students who have special needs share services with the ESL teacher as well as the Special Education teacher. These students  have 2 teachers in almost all of their content area classes. This is specifically designed.     Our special services team meets every week for one hour and this meeting informs recommendations made to classroom  teachers working with all subgroups, as well as the collaborative curriculum planning under taken by our three special services  teachers (ESL and 2 Special Education Teachers).     We purchased Rosetta Stone for English and used this program for Academic Intervention Services (AIS) for targeted students  to work towards proficiency in the NYSESLAT. We are awaiting funding to renew our contract.     In addition, as a faculty, we have all been scheduled to attend a DOE session that equates our lessons to the common core  standards. The ESL teacher and Special Education work closely with the general education classroom students to scaffold  lessons and content for students with disabilities as well as English Language Learners.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All of special services teachers teach co taught classes at the James Baldwin School. We believe in a strong co teaching model.  One special education teacher, Stephanie Blanch co teaches 1- 90 minute classes along with an advisory that meets 4 x/week.  She also teaches 2-50 minutes sections of SETTS 4X a week. The other special education teaacher , David Ward teaches 1-90  minute class that meets 4X/week along with an advisory. He also teaches 2 sections of 50 minutes social studies class that  meets 4x a week. The ESL teacher, Shilisha October, teacher 1- 90 minute classes, 2- 50 minute Regents Prep classes that meet  for 4x/week along with an ESL advisory that meets for 40 minutes 4x/week. In other words, ESL students and Special Education  students receive an integrated education at all times. They receive accomodations on all exams and tests that include  standardized as well as class level exams. All students receiving special services are included on all college trips as well as  school wide trips. In addition, our admission staff  holds several required meetings after intake to orient parents and families  to our school and our opportunities. ESL students were in attendance and had a bilingual translator present at these events.  Students are also made aware of all activities and clubs both inside and outside of the school and in our history have been in  great attendance and have taken advantage of such opportunities.                                      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ESL teacher at our school has mainly an ESL advisory. During this time, students are focused on the ELA regents and  practicing reading, writing, listening and speaking.      For the US History class, students are programmed into the history class where the ESL teacher pushes in. As a result, students  are prepared and trained to complete a performance based assessment task which is the equivalent of a Regents exam. With  the help of the content social studies teacher and ESL teacher’s practices, they design a curriculum to help meet the needs of  ESL students as well as provide them with the necessary skills for social studies according to the common core high school  standards.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ESL students who have not yet passed the ELA Regents are also programmed into ESL advisory. In addition, a Regents  prepatory course is cotaught by the ELA teacher, Rob Reyes and the ESL teacher, Shelly October.  In the Spring terms, students will be placed in English Language arts class as well as a science/math class with either a special  education teacher and/or an ESL teacher.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming year, we have decided to implement after school tutoring by each content area teacher before and after  school. This provides more opportunities for students to meet in small groups with their teachers at different times for more  opportunity for individualized education.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no discontinued programs at this time.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The James Baldwin School is a firm believer of equal opportunity. At our school, all students are invited to be a part of major  clubs, teams and events. A number of ESL students are heavily involved with senior committee planning,  Fairness, art club,  yoga, tutoring,  girls group, math club, team iron chef, weight room, sailing, mock trials, community action group etc.     Because our ELL population is in contact daily with Natalie Soto, our ESL coordinator, she personally informs students of all  after school and other opportunities, and any opportunities relevant to their needs and interests.              12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We also use methods such as SIOP to help meet the needs of ESL students.     In addition, we use differentiated texts so that all kids have access to the same concepts but at different levels.  On reading days, we provide leisure reading in native languages such as Spanish and French.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The ESL teacher has bought class sets of translation dictionaries that are used in classes. Also, there has recently been a push in  content area classes for students to share their language through presentations. For example, in science, there are concept  maps in science that will be in Spanish and English.     Curriculum, classroom libraries, books and bookshelves, are developed by departments with student native cultures and  language in mind, for instance, an English course that allows student groupings according to cultural heritage and topic  interest.       Our parent coordinator provided all mass mailings in English and Spanish. Also if ever a student’s parent needs to be  contacted, she contacts the parents as well and translates information to the parent/guardian in Spanish.       FOr other languages, we use the DOE service for translation.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         At the James Baldwin School, we have mixed grade classes to encourage student growth and learning from each other. The  services provided correspond to mandated minutes rather than grade level but all classes are driven to the college ready  standard of the common core.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We also use methods such as SIOP to help meet the needs of ESL students.     In addition, we use differentiated texts so that all kids have access to the same concepts but at different levels.  On reading days, we provide leisure reading in native languages such as Spanish and French.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to enrollment any new ELL student meets with Natalie Soto, ESL coordinator, and Advisor, to assist with transition into  our program.  Students are targeted for Crew (guidance class) with Natalie to assure continuity during transition.     Our admissions officer, Christine Olson makes sure to introduce every new ELL to Natalie Soto to discuss the potential program  model, offerings and to answer any questions. New students are also paired up with current ELLs to help smooth the transition  of coming to our school.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All students are offered independent study opportunities for any languages not offered at the school during a given semester.    Our school provides two semesters of foreign language (French and Arabic) and culture.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The James Baldwin School is a freestanding ESL class.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. There are currently only two licensed ESL teachers, Natalie Soto and Abby Kirchman. They follow the professional  development given by CFN and also the professional development given to our general teaching staff.  Professional development in basic literacy instructional strategies is a major theme this year. For two years, we funded a  literacy consultant that worked closely with the special service team to develop further strategies for students with special  needs and English language learners.  In addition, every teacher new to our school is required by our partner, ELOB, to attend  week-long reading and writing workshops.  In addition, teachers are trained by ELOB to use rubrics and standardized  assessment data to inform teaching.  All teachers have weekly common planning and meeting time.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         In addition, our school is a Performance Based school which provides multiple opportunities to show student strength and  growth. Part of our professional development has been looking into other schools to find other best practices and support for  ELL students.              To support staff, the ESL teacher leads literacy workshops to help teachers assist ELLs from middle school to high school. Some  of these workshops include teaching SIOP, reading and writing workshops and cultural differences.     During faculty meeting, we have a protocol called, “student protocol” where teachers discuss and share helpful information  about new students that can range from academic challenges and weaknesses to socio-emotional well being. The ESL teacher  provided helpful information to content area teachers about best practices and strategies to work with these kids.  Natalie Soto  attends and leads professional development with our partner, NYCOB and CFN including site visits to other  schools with ELL programs to study and learn from.                   2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  At the James Baldwin School, we are a transfer school that accepts students who are already in high school.   As part of the PBAT Consortium, Professional Development is offered regularly in role-alike groups, including ESL. When the  DOE provides professional development, the Principal Brady Smith notifies the ESL teacher, Natalie Soto, and she attends  those sessions as needed.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    The primary means of communication between families and teachers is the Student Advisor system.  Each student has a  personal academic advisor, with whom s/he meets 4 periods per week.  The Advisor is the primary liaison between school and  parents, and ELL related communication is provided to parents through the Advisor.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Partners of the James Baldwin School include the LGBT Community Center, Hudson Guild social service agency, NYC Outward  Bound, the Integral Yoga Center, all of whom offer direct services to students and families, on and off-site.                 Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christine Olson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The James Baldwin School                                                                              School DBN: 313  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

We keep a roster of school staff who speak Spanish and can interpret as needed. For languages other than Spanish,  we access the Translation and Interpretation Unit by referring to the "I Speak…" card that everybody received at a  training in September.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We conduct multiple parent surveys during the year to collect parent information, including DOE mandated surveys as  well as school created surveys. Surveys are online with translation immediately available. As a transfer high school, we  also meet with every family at intake and gather feedback then on language preferences and other translation and  interpretation needs.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57
