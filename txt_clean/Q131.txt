This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      PS 131′s school mission is to meet the academic cultural, social and emotional needs of all children. We promote a  thirst for knowledge through standards-based instruction in a risk-free environment, to ready them for successful  college and career opportunities. We promote a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a focus on the  Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), balanced literacy, problem-solving in mathematics and science, hands-on  technology and community and global exploration in social studies. The staff promotes life-long learning skills by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      challenging students to be explorative and critical thinkers. The principal supports this mission by aligning resources,  budget and professional development.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our K to grade 5 school supports 812 students. Twelve percent of our population have IEPs, and 19% of our students  are English as a New Language students (ENLs). Eighty-two percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced  lunch. The School Quality Snapshot for 2016-2017 shows that student performance in Mathematics is above the city  and district comparison with 62.0% proficient as compared to 42.0% and 34.0%, respectively. PS 131 was rated  excellent and good in Mathematics in closing the achievement gap for ENLs and SWDs. We were also rated excellent  in English Language Arts in closing the achievement gap for ENLs and SWDs. The school’s results were at 58.0%  proficient, in comparison to the city and district averages 40% and of 40.0%, respectively.    PS 131 prides itself in being a school community that supports one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect. All  staff works together in striving to provide all of our students with the necessary skills and resources that will help  them to face life challenges ahead. We are committed to academic achievement and to providing quality learning in a  safe and nurturing setting.    We are in our 2nd year of District 29's partnership with Imagine Learning to support ENL students language and  vocabulary development. Students can use this integral learning tool in the classroom and at home. Students also  have at-home online access to Thinking Maps Learning Community, Wonders and Think Central using their own  individual user names and passwords to access content that supports the work being done in the classroom. All of  these sites can be accessed via the P.S. 131 homepage.   We have a strong community partnership with St. Johns University and Adelphi University. Within this past school  year we have placed five student teachers and approximately ten student observers.    Beginning school year 2017-2018, P.S. 131 Queens began initiating Thinking Maps. Thinking Maps are consistent  visual patterns linked directly to eight specific thought processes. By visualizing our thinking, we create images of  abstract thoughts. These patterns help all students reach higher levels of critical and creative thinking - essential  components of 21st Century education . In our school-wide implementation Thinking Maps establish a consistent  Language for Learning. Fourteen staff members have completed their "Trainer of Teachers Training (TOTS)" and every  staff member has been trained in implementing Thinking Maps.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school’s instructional focus for the 2018-2019 is Math. To ensure that the necessary conditions are in place so  that students are intellectually active in learning important and challenging content. With such a large ENL and SWD  population, we are implementing various programs that focus on mastering content and problem solving:   School-wide problem solving Fridays focusing on the CUBE method        Departmentalized Algebra For All in grade 5    Daily fluency checks during the math block    Use of Thinking Maps to make student thinking visible in math     After school math program to focus on remedial math skills and vocabulary   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10           Grade specific inquiry team meetings to analyze student math word problems and discuss best practices    6-week cycle of Professional Development for all staff around problem solving strategies and methods.   4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress over the past year is  Strong Family and Community Ties. Data shows an increase from 2017 to 2018, 3.38 to 3.50 on the survey. Another  success is the Rigorous Instruction element in creating and revising unit plans ensuring that curricula is aligned to CCLS  and strategically integrated with the instructional shifts resulting in coherence across grades and subject areas that  promote college and career readiness for all students. This work is evident through the inquiry process and core  inquiry team work.   Our key areas of focus for this school year align with two elements of the Framework for Great Schools. At PS 131, it is  our goal to continue to create a community of learners among our staff members. We believe that it is essential for all  staff members to work collaboratively, share knowledge and resources, analyze data, and plan together in order to  refine lessons and teaching approaches so that all learners experience success and meet standards. Collaborative  Teachers is our major element of focus for the 2018-2019 school year.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q131   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05, SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   812   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

SLT data from the 2017-18 school year showed that an average of 10 parents per grade attended each of  the four Thinking Map workshops offered.   2. We will leverage the trust that our families have in us in order to continue support for our Thinking Maps initiative.  In order for PS 131 to become an effective Thinking Maps community, we must ensure that all community members  are "fluent" in the language of Thinking Maps. Thinking Maps will be re-introduced during Meet the Teacher Night  and then during our 12-week roll-out of Thinking Maps, teacher teams will host parent Thinking Map workshops.  Subsequent workshop will be held throughout the year as we develop into a Thinking Map community, based on our  community's needs.

The administrative team will monitor the portfolios (multiple assessment measures) twice a year and provide teachers  with actionable feedback.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   440,521     43,083     18,510     0     4,433,061      X     X     X     X     X      Column B   Section Reference(s)  5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E     0     5E     0     5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 131 Abigail Adams School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 131 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

We will be running an after school program with the Title III funding:    The after school program  will be a two days a week after school program, on Wednesdays and  Thursdays from 2:20 until 3:50 using Imagine Learning Software that will serve up to 32  ELL  students in grades 3 – 5 with 2 fully certified ESL teachers and a once a week morning program,  Thursdays from 7:30 until 8:15, for kindergarten students with a a fully certified ESL  teacher. Teachers for this program will mark attendance daily and keep a record of this  attendance in a folder for the entire program which will remain in the ESL room at both  locations. All workshop agendas and parent sign in sheet will be maintained by the ESL teachers  at PS 131 and at the PS 35 Annex.   This program will notify parents with the Title III letters provided by NYS (from prior years) in  English and/or the parents' preferred home language. With a total of 2 fully certified ESL  teachers, all currently teaching ESL at PS 131, Q, Title III instruction will be delivered as  follows: Part 1 Imagine Learning English After School Program for grades 3 – 5 for 2 days a  week (Wednesdays and Thursdays)  To supplement services for grades 3 – 5 an after-school program for ELLs at risk according to  the EDAT tool, newcomer and regular ELLs identified as being at risk will be invited to the  program. The program will focus on developing students’ literacy skills by emphasizing  vocabulary development, phonics, reading comprehension, and building writing skills. The  purpose of this program will be to accelerate English language literacy acquisition in order to  allow students to participate meaningfully in classroom activities within a small group size. This  grouping is highly interactive and is received well by the students.  They look forward to the  individualized attention and support. Programs to be used are Imagine Learning English  Software. This group is comprised of 32 ELLs in grades 3 -5, which will include students who  are newcomers, 4 – 6 year ELLs, and Long Term ELLs. This afterschool program will operate  Wednesdays and Thursdays 2:20 pm until 3:50 pm for about 32 students with 2 fully certified  ESL Teachers.  Teachers will focus on building these students’ literacy skills two days a week  during the after-school program.  The data tool for the Imagine Learning program will be utilized  to work with students in small groups by providing small group reteach skills provided by the  Imagine Learning intervention tool. This program will supplement English language acquisition  for the ELLs who have been receiving ESL services for 3-6 years and newcomer/SIFE ELLs.  The program to be used will be Imagine Learning English software program which has proven to  be effective in accelerating English language acquisition. Imagine Learning teaches vocabulary  development, including academic language, listening and speaking skills, phonemic awareness,  emergent literacy, and school readiness. This computer program has been revamped to take into  account the new Common Core Standards. This program begins in the students’ native language,  if available, and gradually increases English exposure as the child progresses. It achieves this  through the use of music and art where students receive one-on-one differentiated instruction,  designed to meet the needs of each child.  This program has been used successfully in this school  and the data suggests the more time spent on the program, the higher student gains are made in  letter knowledge, vocabulary, phonemic awareness, and oral production.  For the 4 months that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   the program was in effect at our school last year, the ELLs showed significant gains in listening  comprehension (41.9%), conversational phrases (46.5%), basic vocabulary (25.4%) and  academic language (50%).  Literacy development has also been measured and we have found  that reading comprehension has increased 62.1% for leveled texts. Our hope is that this program  will help our students succeed in acquiring the English they need to excel in school and meet the  reading demands and tasks of not only standardized testing, but the common core curriculum.  The afterschool program will operate Tuesdays and Thursdays for one hour and thirty minute  sessions for the students. Two fully certified ESL teachers will facilitate the program in the  Technology room. Students will attend the afterschool program from 2:20 pm until 3:50 pm.  Funding for the program will go towards per-session payment for the 2 fully-certified ESL  teachers.  The cost of this program will be 2 teachers x at 1.5 hour sessions x $54.81 per hour x 2  times a week x for 34 weeks = $11,345.67. The program will commence on Wednesday, October  2nd, 2018 and continue until Friday, March 17th, 2017. This amount will pay for direct  instruction.   Part 2 Imagine Learning English Before School Program for Kindergarten students once a week  at PS 35 Annex on Thursday mornings  A fully certified ESL teacher will invite up to 10 Kindergarten students to receive the Imagine  Learning Software program on Thursdays. This program commences on November 5th and will  end on April 4th. The ESL teacher will arrive at 7:30 to set up and the students will arrive by  7:45 am until 8:15 am. Funding for the program will go towards per-session payment for the  fully certified ESL teacher. The cost of this program will be 1 teacher x at .75 an hour session x  $54.81 per hour x 1 time a week x 19 weeks = $781.04. This amount will pay for direct  instruction.    Materials needed to enhance this experience for students would require the school to purchase  more iPads to download the Imagine Learning program onto, thus allowing more students to  attend this supplemental program. The cost of the iPads, headsets and protective cases will not  exceed $3,702. We will continue to utilize the prior purchases to invite even more students.

Since most of the parents in this community predominantly speak Bengali, but  can read in English ( a fact noticed in most parent survey responses) We want to provide an adult  English communication class for our Title III parents. This program would enable parents to  learn about topics that are high communication needs for them. The topics to be presented will  be based on a needs survey given to parents who want to take the English for Communication  program that will be offered in October. All documents related to this program will be sent to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    DOE's Interpretation and Translation Unit for translation into parents' preferred language of  written communication.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses i-Ready online testing and NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores to inform our instruction for early literacy skills, as  well as Imagine Learning computer program data for all students including ELLs. Students reading levels are assessed using  Fountas and Pinnell with the TC running records. The data gained from these tools allow teachers to form flexible  differentiated groups within their classrooms in order to help students perform according to the NYS Common Core Learning  Standards.  The ELLs are then differentiated even further by their level of ENL and modality strengths and weaknesses by the  ESL teachers during Stand Alone ENL instructional time.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         The structures in place to support this effort are computer based reports from Renaissance Learning, Imagine Learning  benchmark/literacy test reports and ATS reports that are available to the entire staff. Determining students' instructional  levels is an important component of deciding how to successfully inform instruction. Teachers also use inquiry to drive  instruction by looking at student data. The data can also come from unit tests from the ELA curriculum from Wonders.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  PS 131 evaluates the success of its program for ELLs by relying on data from multiple sources. The school uses the EDAT,  results from the NYS Common Core ELA and Math exams, NYSESLAT results, Schoolnet reports, and information from the  School Quality Guide and teacher observations. If any drops in performance are noted, the school examines the data closely to  try to understand why there was a decrease. Changes in instruction to ELLs are made accordingly to increase scores the  following school year. This current school year, the CEP goals are closely tied to increasing AYP for ELLs. The CEP has been  shared with the entire staff and the goals set forth, along with the action plan are closely tied to instructional goals.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teacher based inquiry of data helps to determine how to address student needs and strengths. Teachers that do not see the  expected progress for their student, bring the student to the attention of the RTI committee. This committee develops a plan  and time frame in which to deliver quality and research based instruction to the student. The next steps include progress  monitoring to ensure the student is making progress.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 131 uses data from multiple sources to guide instruction for ELLs within the RtI framework. First a meeting is set with the  RtI team to discuss a student’s performance and a plan is implemented for creating support for a student who is considered at  risk. Data used can consist of: students’ Fountas and Pinnell benchmark running records, MoSL and periodic assessments,  teacher observations, classroom performance, STAR reports and reports from Imagine Learning are used.  After a 6 to 8 week  period of using the supports recommended by the RtI team, data is again collected, analyzed and interpreted to see if any  improvements have been noted. Decisions are then made for next steps in the RtI process for students.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome assessments include the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, Stars Reading Level, and data obtained from prolonged  interaction with Imagine Learning software.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers meet bimonthly, at the least, during the year and use inquiry protocols to examine student work. This examination  leads to collaborative discussions on how to differentiate or modify instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 131 delivers (and has been delivering) ENL instruction through an Integrated ENL and Stand Alone ENL program  delivery of instruction. There are 2 to 3 classes on each grade that are heterogeneously grouped with ELLs. Each  ESL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         teacher works with the classroom teacher in grades K through 4 to integrate content area instruction for these  classes. Transitioning and expanding level students are fully serviced by this method. Students that are at the entering  and emerging level of English proficiency are served by 1 unit (180 minutes) of Integrated program delivery and 1 unit  of standalone ENL (180 minutes) with fully certified ESL teachers. The commanding ELLs are also serviced by 1 Unit  (90 minutes) of instruction with fully certified ESL teachers. Fifth grade is block scheduled and the ESL teacher works  during the ELA block with the ELA teacher to deliver Integrated ENL/ELA instruction.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     not applicable    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      not applicable    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Transitioning, commanding, and expanding level students are fully serviced by the integrated co-teaching model for 1 unit or  .5 units of time in ELA. Students that are at the entering and emerging level of English proficiency are served by 1 unit of  Integrated co-teaching program delivery in ELA and 1 unit of standalone ENL with fully certified ESL teachers. NLA is supported  with language teaching assistants, peer partners, tests other than ELA are given in native language when available (i.e. Math  MoSL, GoMath assessments, Math Benchmarks) bilingual books and dictionaries, and with time on Imagine Learning English.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered to students in English for both the integrated co-teaching for ELA and standalone ENL. Classroom  teachers of ELLs are given training by the ESL teachers on how to use supports for their ELLs. ESL teachers use EngageNY’s  Common Core New Language Progressions and Disciplinary Reading Comprehension Strategies like articulating specific  language and content objectives, anchoring instruction using short videos, visuals, and graphic organizers, integrating explicit  academic vocabulary instruction, providing daily opportunities for students to talk about content in pairs or small groups, and  providing writing opportunities to extend students’ understanding of content. These methods are research based to provide  language development and make content comprhensible. All ELL program models in the all content areas allow for native  language support using glossaries, bilingual books in the different native languages at our school, and interpretation by  language paras.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Since we do not have direct NLA programs for Chinese or Spanish ELLs, we do not administer the ELE or Chinese Reading  exams. We do, however, provide home language tests using benchmark tests in Math and Science from Schoolnet. If a  language is not available, we provide native language interpretation of tests. Native language is evaluated through use of  native language tests in mathematics in the form of Fall and Spring Benchmark tests, Math Baseline and Math MoSL.   Our Go  Math program has tests and texts available in Spanish for students to use in school or at home. ELLs are given the benefit of  extra time and oral translation of NYS Science and Mathematics exams.  Frequency of assessments occur as needed when the  assessment is formative and summative assessments happen at the end of units, typically monthly. Newcomers in grades 3-5  that perform below the transitioning level of English language acquisition, are given the New York State SIFE determination  survey, to help identify students with Students with interrupted/inconsistent formal education. Once this determination is  made, a plan to assist these students is commenced.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      a.    Differentiation for SIFE students is delivered by providing scaffolds that first help students’ master foundational skills in  ELA and Math with plenty of practice and repetition in small groups. SIFE students also taught using theme-based lessons that  provide many scaffolds to help with understanding.      b.   Differentiation for newcomers is delivered by instruction that is theme-based with native language supports and scaffolds  that help with comprehensible input. Strengths in students’ native language are assessed and used to help drive instruction.    c.   Differentiation for developing students is the use of scaffolds that are provided and used until students master the  language and content without those scaffolds for all content areas.    d.  Differentiation for Long Term ELLs is providing individualized support in the content areas within small groups based on  feedback from assessments.    e.  Differentiation for Former ELLs is provided for 90 minutes (.5 units) during integrated co-teaching ELA instruction for two  years. These students continue to receive extended time for exams and small group instruction to reinforce and extend  content area skills.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers use for ELL SWD students is by analyzing data from multiple  sources (class exams/observations, tests on Schoolnet, individual reading levels, math quizzes and unit exams to name  a few)for structuring learning centers based on flexible grouping. The learning centers include both: fiction and nonfiction  reading and writing activities , spelling, grammar and technology. These activities are designed with the students levels in  mind. The goal of all of these centers is make the curriculum accessible to all learners and increase students' English  acquisition. These centers are used when then the ENL teacher provides Integrated Content area instruction. The classroom  teacher, the ENL teacher, language paras and other paras break into small groups to facilitate instruction. Students at the  technology station go on Imagine Learning English, a computer based program that has years of research to prove its role in  providing English language acquisition for ELLs and struggling readers. Other groups use texts from multiple sources and at the  appropriate grade levels/individual reading levels to guide a student through the process of reaching reading goals.  Students  are given strategies appropriate to their IEP and the ENL teacher scaffolds for the ELLs where necessary. These instructional  strategies include: "frontloading" difficult academic language, explicit instruction and modeling using thik alouds. The school  ensures that all SWD ELLs receive all of their IEP mandates by sharing scheduling and fixing any conflicts. SWD ELLs receive ENL  services according to their IEP. If the IEP indicates ESL only, the ENL teacher will provide the mandated minutes according to  the student's level. If a SWD ELL student's IEP requires Bilingual services, the child is placed in the appropriate setting  depending upon the number of students also receiving that mandate. If there are insufficient numbers to open a 12:1 Bilingual  class, then an alternate placement para provides the native language instruction for the student.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL services for ELL-SWDs include an Integrated co-teaching model and a Stand Alone ENL program. Students are  mainstreamed for science and physical education. In the 3,4,5 Special Education 12:1 class, instruction is delivered by the  classroom teacher, ENL teacher,  and Educational Assistants in small differentiated groups formulated by grade level and  English proficiency level. All teachers servicing these students are well- informed on each child's IEP goals and learning  needs.  ICT is flexibly scheduled by grouping students with general time and/or 12:1 time as per their IEP. The ICT and general  education work cooperatively in planning the curriculum and the delivery of instruction. The criteria for SWD ELLs placed in the  ICT classes is made by the students ability to work in a larger class and by providing instruction in the least restrictive  environment for the student.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention plans for ELLs in ELA and Math consist of quality curriculum planning that allows for differentiation of  instruction and re-teaching of simple and complex skills. Students are also placed on the Imagine Learning computer program  that has been highly recommended by the NYC Office of ELLs for reading, writing and academic vocabulary during classroom   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      time. The Imagine Learning program is equipped with native language support in 15 languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French,  Haitian Creole, Korean, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Marshallese, Tagalog, Cantonese, Hmong, and  Somali. The program offers timely data indicating where students are on the program. Teachers can utilize the data to increase  fluency, vocabulary, comprehension and the data empowers teachers with immediate actionable data.  The program will set  up groups for the teachers with the skills they need additional instruction on. The Wonders reading program is the new  program being utilized for grades K - 3 at PS 131. The program offers leveled readers with a particular focus on ELLs. Teachers  test frequently on comprehension, spelling and vocabulary. Data is used reteach when necessary in small guided reading  groups.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Data trends in ELA for our curriculum showed that ELLs are not doing well on unit exams. One of the CEP goals addresses this  trend and has an action plan that all teachers of ELLs will implement. Overall school training in Thinking Maps is one way the  entire staff will address the needs of ELLs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We were scheduled to have a Bengali bilingual program for kindergarten, but it never began for two reasons. The first reason  was that not enough parents that had eligible children to attend selected the program. The other reason was that a qualified,  certified Bengali bilingual teacher had not been found to teach the program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all programs in are building. Flyers are sent out in the parents' preferred language for all  extracurricular and curricular activities. ELLs are included in afterschool programs for test prep for ELA and Math, Title III  afterschool programs, school performances, CASA (a special grant from a local politician), and all afterschool parent activities  like Math game night and Literacy/pajama night. During these activities, the school hires interpreters to help parents  understand what is being done. ELLs are included in all activities by making sure parents are aware of these opportunities with  frequent communication in their preferred home languages.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Instructional materials that support ELLs include bilingual math texts available for home/school use for the GoMath program,  Imagine Learning English is used within classrooms as well as for Afterschool, Smartboards are in every classroom, and  bilingual libraries are available online because the ESL teachers have gained access to Learning  A to Z through the D.O.E.'s ELL  Department.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered in the ENL program through use of glossaries, bilingual libraries (Bengali, Spanish, Urdu,  Tagalog, and Arabic), the Imagine Learning program, and language educational assistants. ESL teachers also have access to  Learning A to Z which has bilingual books.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    PS 131 ensures that all required services/resources support and correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels by making sure that  students are properly placed when enrolled by adhering to the Chancellor’s Regulations and protocols for registration. If a  student’s age does not match their grade, we use all resources at our disposal to assess whether a placement at a higher/lower  grade level is appropriate. Services for SWD ELLs are adapted by following the recommendations on the IEPto support student  learning. A child in SWD is afforded the least restrictive environment depending on their cognitive abilities.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our Kindergarten classes are co-located. Sources are shared through use of Google Docs and emails.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are assisted by the ESL Coordinator during registration. Parents are given a tour of the school and given a  parent handbook in the preferred native language of the parent. They are shown the Parent Orientation Video and all  questions about programs, lunch, and school times are answered. Incoming Kindergarten students and their families are given  a kindergarten orientation with translators and a tour of the building by the kindergarten teachers and the parent  coordinator.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives available in our elementary school.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   not applicable        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for all teachers of ELLs is every month an ELL PD during the Monday afternoon PD time  from 2:20 to 3:40. Teachers are given PD by the ESL Department to 3 to 4 groups of teachers on a variety of topics which may  include: Listening and Speaking – Oral Language and Vocabulary Development for ELLs; Math and Science: Skills and Strategies  to Adapt Instruction for English Learners; How to use questioning techniques for all ELL levels; the New ELL levels and What  They Mean; BICs and CALP: what they are and how it impacts learning; Differentiating Instruction Strategies for English  Language Learners; ELL Strategies That Work for the Whole Class; Making Content Comprehensible for ELL Students; Reinvent  Your Reading & Writing Instruction for ELL Students;  ELL Instruction for Teaching Higher Level Thinking Skills. These  professional development topics are selected by the school's Professional Development Committee depending on teacher,  paraprofessional, school psychologist, speech therapist, ESL teacher, special education teacher, assistant principal , guidance  counselor, parent coordinator  and school secretaries needs. These plans are still in the process of being ironed out. Dates will  be determined and entered.    ENL Teachers will be attending monthly PDs offered by the ELL Team at the Queens South BFSC as well as PDs offered by the  DELLSS. ESL teachers will be meeting weekly to read research materials by Andrea Honigsfeld in order to meet the rigorous  common core state standards for ELLs. The first book club will be around the book "Common Core for the not so Common  Learner" by Andrea Honigsfeld. The ESL teachers will be discussing best practices and trying them out to see if they assist in ELL  comprehension.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS 131 meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 by giving all teachers PD that meets the needs  of ELL students every other month, for a total of 5 to 6 sessions of all PD time. Agendas and attendance folders are maintained  by the ESL department. The ENL teachers also are given 18 sessions of PD by guest speakers and webinars about ELL topics   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         twice a month to meet the CR Part 154.2 requirements. Agendas and attendance are maintained also by the ESL  Department.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 131 provides individual meetings with parents during the Tuesday afternoon parent meeting time. Parents of ELLs are given  any related scores for Periodic Assessments, teacher assessments and language development needs. Goals are made for  students and translators are made available at the parent’s request or when the meeting is scheduled.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Each ESL teacher keeps records of all parent communications in the form of a log. The ESL ascertains the parental preferred  language before all meetings, sends translated letters to invite parents, and uses school translators as well as paid services  from a preferred DOE provider. ELL Parent involvement in PS 131 includes workshops provided by the parent coordinator, ESL  teachers and other staff. These activities range from project based activities, such as family tree projects, to workshops that  help explain the common core learning standards and topics on how to help your child.  This year's CEP goal for parent  involvement will include all parents receiving training and information on the school wide initiative to make Thinking Maps a  visible and powerful learning tool for critical thinking in the entire school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Veronica DePaolo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Abigail Adams Elementary Schoo                                                                              School DBN: 29Q131  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Information that the parents provide about their preferred written and oral communication language from each  Home Language Survey is entered into ATS by the pupil personnel secretary and the data is summarized by the  ELL Team, data specialists, and administrative team to determine the language preferences for communicating  with all parents. All documents sent home are available in the various languages spoken by our parents. All  teachers receive a copy of the report which indicates the parent language preference. School report cards are  sent home in the home language (that the DOE provides) indicated on the home language survey. When the staff  contacts a parent via phone, the Emergency Blue Cards indicate the language spoken and written at home. The  staff uses the translation unit to communicate with individuals that do speak another language at home. Language  lists from the RAPG on ATS are updated and provided to each classroom teacher when changes to their class  occur.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64     2.

Include   procedures to  ensure timely  provision of  translated   documents to   parents.    P.S. 131 uses  the DOE  Translation  and  Interpretation  Unit service,  which requires  submission of  documents to  be translated  one month in  advance. This  also ensures  that  documents are  ready to be  distributed to  parents in a  timely manner.     Principal and Grade-Specific Newsletters are   distributed monthly to families.     As students register throughout the year,  families receive the necessary translated  registration and ESL related documents.     Parent coordinator related documents are           translated and distributed to families  throughout the year, as meetings, events,  activities and announcements arise.    School documents are translated and  distributed to families throughout the year,  as meetings, events, activities and  announcements arise.         1. The documents that PS 131 typically  disseminates to parents every year and puts in  for translation to the Translation and  Interpretation Unit based on Preferred Parent  Languages are:   • All ESL related documents – like the HLIS,  Parent Survey and Selection Form, Placement  letters, Entitlement letters, Continued  Entitlement letters, Non-Entitlement letters, test  schedules for the NYSESLAT and ESL parent  newsletters.  • Registration related documents – blue  emergency cards, lunch forms, and parent  information handbooks.  • Parent Coordinator related documents – like  flyers about parent workshops, monthly  calendars, senior activities, and announcements  about special activities like bake sales.  • School leadership documents – like report  cards, Principal’s monthly newsletters, IEP  documents, testing information and other school  related activities like afterschool programs and  parent-teacher conference announcements.  The school has certain people on each grade  responsible for submitting monthly newsletters  to the DOE translation unit at least three weeks  before it is due to be given out to parents.   P.S. 131  administration  sets deadlines,  with built-in  time for  translation, for  grade-specific  newsletters to  be submitted  for approval by  administration.  This ensures  newsletters  are submitted  on time for  proper  translation.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Language services, oral and written, are provided at parent meetings and workshops. We will continue to conduct  school language surveys which will be distributed for completion to each family in our. We will also provide  translators to assist our parents with the completion of the surveys. We will also continue to provide our parents  translated notices in the various languages spoken within our school community. Interpretation notice signs are  posted in the entrance of the school, the main office, and each classroom. Oral translation is provided at PTA  meetings for whole documents such as Safety Procedures and the Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibility. This year we  will conduct exit surveys from meetings to make sure that we are providing adequate translation and interpretation  services as per Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-633.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will use exit surveys and/or online surveys sent by e-mail to gather feedback from parents on the quality and  availability of services. We will do this after parent-teacher conferences, parent workshops, and other school events.  The school is considering a panel of parents to serve as a focus group to provide feedback on best practices for all the  cultures represented in our building. Results of a June 2018 Language Access Parent Survey show that 91% of parents  that responded are completely or more or less satisfied with language services provided. Ninety-one percent are also  satisfied with over-the-phone conversation interpretation. Ninety percent of parents that responded indicated that  they were completely or more or less satisfied with in-person interpretation services. Ninety-four percent of parents  were completely or more or less satisfied with document translation. Overall satisfaction was found to 95% of all  respondents. Parental comments were: 60% had no feedback, 30% gave positive feedback and 10% had negative  feedback (not all feedback pertained to the delivery of translation and interpretation services provided by PS 131). We  also found the percentages of the use of which type of survey was used: 77% responded using the English survey,  while 23% responded using the translated survey. We will the feedback from this survey to improve our translation  and interpretation services to parents. Some of the Bengali parents believed we have used Google translate to  translate documents, when this is not the case. We will try to make our staff preview what is being sent out in other  languages to make sure the correct message is being disseminated.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
