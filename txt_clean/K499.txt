The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   ACORN Community High School Mission and Vision    Mission    ACORN Community High School will provide a global learning environment of high expectations that is not only  rigorous in high academic standards, but also self-empowering. Through performance based assessment, all members  of the ACHS community are able to collaborate, question and transform into life-long learners and refined critical  thinkers.   Vision    As we empower the ACHS community to transform, success is the only option.   ACORN Community High School was founded in 1996 as a partnership between the New York City Board of Education  and A.C.O.R.N. (The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). ACORN Community High School  (ACHS) was established to provide a small, safe, personalized, and challenging alternative to the zoned high schools.  ACHS is centrally located between Crown Heights, Bedford Stuyvesant, and the Fort Greene Brooklyn neighborhoods.  ACORN Community High School is located in Northern Brooklyn and serves student a population of just under 400  from all 5 boroughs of New York City. We are one of the few mid-size traditional high schools left in Brooklyn.    Our goal as a school is to provide our students with a rich learning environment that will well prepare them for the  21st century. This includes, preparing students for college and career choices in STEM and Law fields and we want our  students to be ready for demands of an increasingly technological workplace. In order to meet these demands,  students must have a strong foundation in Literacy, Writing, Math and Science. As part of this groundwork, we must  provide them with rigorous coursework at the high school level and the skills necessary to be successful.    As a school we have worked collaboratively to establish common practices and identify partnerships and initiatives  that support our school demographic:       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   ACORN CHS provides is a small nurturing environment where are expected to learn the skills necessary to compete  in today’s global economic market. Students are taught the importance of contributing to their communities as well  as their academic endeavors.    In order to support the growing interest of students in the school, as of 2018-2019 we will have two special  academies that will be implemented: A Cyber Academy and Early Childhood Education Academy   Currently, ACHS participates in AP for All which has provided 50% of our students to have access to AP classes in  Math, Science, Social Studies and English. All of our students from grades 9 through 12 participate in College/Career  Access activities which include college trips, an alumni day - where alumni come back to visit share their college  experiences, male/female symposiums (career days) and internships. In addition, as a College Access for All school,  we have also identified two alumni who will serve as college coaches for our 11th and 12th grade cohorts  throughout the rest of the school year and summer.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Academics and Programs   The following curricular, pedagogical and assessment practices and routines are implemented to foster a shared  understanding of effective instruction, implementation of rigor and strategic use of the Danielson Framework for  Teaching:       Curricular, Pedagogical and Assessment Practices    Focused note-taking to improve student comprehension and engagement in course material       Common Core embedded shifts and tasks- specifically writing in all content areas     Common exams in content areas    Exit tickets, written lesson summaries and catch and release used to provide assessment of student progress   towards lesson objectives and reinforce key takeaways from the lesson     Teachers use the 5-30-10 model to deliver instruction     Unit plans, lesson plans are readily accessible    Teachers use planned questioning to engage students in high level thinking and promote rigor and help   teachers identify lesson modifications, etc. that need to be made      Culturally Relevant teaching practices    Targeted instruction that marries the explicit teaching of literacy skills and strategies to aid students in   accessing content knowledge with increasing independence from the teacher     Use of rubrics and “I Can” statements to ensure students have clear expectations      Use of PDSA (Plan, Do, Say & Act) to do inquiry and monitor systems and structures   Programs     College Access for All   o      Saturday Academy and Extended Day   Learning Partners Program   MEC Health and Science Careers/Early College  LIU Early College Program       AP For All          Brooklyn Reads    CTE Information Technology/Early Childhood  I-Learn      Gaming    Teen Health    ALEKS    Advanced Placement    After-school Clubs & Enrichment – Debate, Girls Talk, Dance, Strategic Games, Adventures Club    PSAL    CDOS    DNA Learning Center    Honor Society      Advisory/Restorative Circles   Partnerships       Microsoft Imagine Academ       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12         LIU   NYU         College Board    Theater Development Fund    Park Armory    Brooklyn Museum    Medgar Evers Pipeline    BAM       Legacy Pathways    Writopia   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special Populations      Approximately 30% of our school population consists of students with Individual Education Programs (IEP’s). Our  approach at ACHS is to initially provide self-contained and Integrated Co-Teaching Classes (ICT) classes for students  who enter ACORN requiring smaller class sizes and greater teacher support. Students performance is tracked by both  the Special Education and content area teachers to determine when students are prepared for work in a less  restrictive environment. Students and their families understand that the expectation is for all students with IEP’s to be  prepared academically and socially to participate in ICT and/or general education classes. Teachers of self-contained  and ICT classes in 9 th and 10 th grade structure their instruction and activities to deliberately prepare students to  enter a less restrictive setting successfully. This system allows us to create a pathway for all entering students to  participate in general education and/or ICT classes in all subject areas in 11 th and 12 th grade, providing a supportive  and intellectually safe environment to prepare students for class structures and instructional rigor they will  experience in college. In addition, according to our High School Quality Snapshot we have an excellent record of  moving our students with special needs to a less restrictive environment.       Although our ELL population is very small, we continuously provide professional development and resources to  support our teachers in mainstream classes. Resources include laptops, word walls, varied reference materials, visual  aids with sight words. In addition, our school enrolls between fifty to sixty percent young men of color, which has  prompted the school to incorporate pedagogy that is culturally relevant.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   College and Career Readiness      At ACHS we have worked diligently to provide our students with the type of support that is necessary to not only get  into college but to be self-sustaining once they get onto campus. During the 14-15 School Year we struggled with our  graduation rate, where only 49% of our students met graduation requirements. At the end of our 2015-2016 school  year our graduation rate increased by 20%, with an overall rate of 73% in August of 2018. This year we have projected  another approximate 5% by August of 2019. However, we still need to increase our College admissions and  sustainability rate. According to the High School Quality Snapshot, students who graduated college ready based on       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      CUNY standards was 21% and students enrolled in college or other post-secondary program within 6 months was  33%.    In addition, we have seen an increase in teacher collaboration and capacity building. This year we have created  opportunities for multiple teams, which include a lead teacher team, grade team and a department teams. each team  has been relegated to work collaboratively on different initiatives to support school progress. The lead teacher team  works collaboratively to provide support in curriculum/unit/lesson planning, modeling for their peers and providing  professional development. The grade team has worked collaboratively in inquiry work through teacher rounds which  has served to enhance classroom teaching practices that support student learning, especially students in our lowest  third. Department teams are lead by the lead teachers and work collaboratively to look at student data and create  Action plans in the form of PDSA (Plan, Do, Study and Act) to impact student learning.   Areas of Focus   With the above data in mind, along with other pertinent data from ATS and STARS, our CEP goals for this school year  are primarily focused on credit accumulation, professional development and engagement in rigorous instructional  practices, enhancement of school culture and increased attendance.   Last year our English regents scores took a dip and we have incorporated changes this year, which include  conferencing and triple entry journal notes to provide more specific feedback on the writing process.                    2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K499   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   193   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   7  7   2  1   % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   20  21        # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   82.0%  % Attendance Rate  80.3%  % Reduced Lunch  5.2%   % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   0.5%  15.5%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  2.6%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience     0%  0%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   79%  62%  76.1%   1.4%   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

In 2017-2018 our students pass rate for the ELA Regent was 44% as compared to 2016-2017 with 56%, however only  28% achieved a 75 or better on the exam which indicates for the school that we need to increase teacher and student  support in order to increase Regents success. During the 2017-2018 school year we have made a conscientious effort to  incorporate literacy and writing across curricula to support improvements in student reading and writing.    Unfortunately our scores have not increased over the past two years, we have shown a decline in our scores. With this  in mind we understand that we have to implement supports and strategies to increase student literacy skills. Reading  and literacy remain our priority due to the level of literacy our student demographic comes with and the intensity of skill  students need to have in order to meet success on the new Common Core ELA regents.   Priority Needs:     Professional development in writing, CLOSE reading strategies, annotation and vocabulary building    Reading and writing instruction strategies used in all classroom content areas     Strengthen the reading-writing connection       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17           Create lessons that engage and motivate students to read and write     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction.

By January 2019, 50% of our students will have passed the ELA regents with a score of 75% or better.     Assistant Principals will provide 11 th and 12 th grade ELA teachers with a list of students who are close to   acquiring the 75% on the ELA exam and students who have not passed the ELA exam, in order to pinpoint the  necessary support. Use of ELA REDS and mock ELA Regents to provide teachers with initial data to outline  strategies to support students on next steps for ELA Regents preparation. The initial mock ELA Regents will be  used as a benchmark; the additional mock exams will be used to monitor student progress. The Regents Prep  Tool will be used to monitor the attendance and the type of support 11 th and 12 th grade students are  receiving. At the beginning of the school year we will have approximately 45% of the Senior Cohort U who  scored 75% on the ELA Regents. We will use a benchmark of 65% by February 2019 in order to mark our  progress.  Incorporate cycles of Inquiry quarterly (November, February, April and June) to provide insight as to what  strategies are working...student work protocols, such as the Tuning Protocol and the Consultancy protocol  will be used regularly to assess student work.        Teachers will generate electronic portfolios via Skedula and GoogleDrive. Teacher assignments and class   notes will be posted to Google Docs and organized via each student’s OSIS number.     The Danielson Rubric will also be utilized to give immediate feedback to teachers around specific and   identified instructional practices.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   Based on our School Quality Snapshot, we have to increase the number of students who make progress towards  graduation. In 2017-2018, 71% of our students met graduation requirements. The data from the School Quality  Snapshot has also indicated over the past two years our 11th grade cohort has accrued the least amount of credits; 64%  in 2015-2016 and 67% in 2016-2017 (2018-2019 TBD). Which is an indicator for the school that we have to put better  interventions and systems in place to keep our 11th grade cohorts on track.    Chronic attendance and lateness appear to be a common denominator in the students ability to meet the requirement  to pass classes. Our current attendance rate is 78% percent , the lowest metric on the School Environment section of the  School Snapshot. A three percent decrease from 2016-2017 attendance data.

We used our Regents data over the last two years (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) in STARS to help to refine our Theory of  Action, which serves to identify specific strategies of instruction that we would like to see across content areas to  increase rigor and overall student growth. Although we have made significant gains on the US History, we still need to  make gains on our CC ELA, CC Algebra and Living Environment regents rates.    Social Studies: June 2017 to June 2018 - US - 22% increase   Living Environment: June 2017 to June 2018 - 19% decrease         CC English: June 2017 to June 2018 - 11% decrease    CC Math: June 2017 to June 2018 - CC Algebra - 0% increase (stayed the same)   In addition, we have also used MOTP data from Advance. Upon looking closely at the data, we found that our teachers  are still in need of additional support and professional development around the use of assessments as indicators for  students next steps and feedback (3d of Danielson). The use of assessment to drive instruction is another key strategy to  support student growth on Regent exams. In addition to using technology to support immediate feedback so students  can practice next steps in real time.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           29      Priority Needs:     Teachers to work collaboratively to identify structures and strategies to support student needs, such as the use   of assessment data to drive instruction     Provide Professional Development for teachers around developing strategies from action research that support   our demographic of students learning needs     Provide Common Meeting Time opportunities during the teacher's day        Part 2 – Annual Goal    Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K499, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       ACORN Community High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students        ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement   level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;     ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and   monitor their child’s progress;     ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,   and in languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56        ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve   outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend our school and will work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;          The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;    ● provide meetings and workshops with parents to support student attendance and behavioral concerns   ●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: Common Core strategies used in the school based on our  Instructional Focus of Writing Across Curricula, sharpening communication skills, literacy, math literacy, accessing  community and support services, technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home and  career and college readiness;    ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent-Teacher Association and Title I  Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● hosting events to support, men asserting leadership in education for their children, parents/guardians,  grandparents and foster parents;    ● invite parents to school Celebrations and Curriculum Fair events to showcase student work   ● providing web access or written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;   ● continue to distribute a school newsletter and provide a web publication (school web site) designed to keep parents  informed about school activities and student progress;   ● Use of Skedula/Pupil Path to provide regular written communication between teacher and the home in a consistent  format and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand ;         School-Parent Compact (SPC)       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template         13K499, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In the fall semester, students are given a practice version of the NYSESLAT. Their performance on the practice exam helps the  ESL teacher to isolate skills in need of improvement, as well as to find leverage points where students could demonstrate gains  after explicit instruction in how one skill set identified as an area of strength (e.g. ability to accurately summarize text) could  be used to address an area of need (e.g., providing specific evidence to support a claim). Additionally, this year all ELL students  will take the ELA MOSL diagnostic in argumentative writing. Item analysis of results will be used to inform instruction in ELA       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         and ESL, as well as to provide guidance for writing instruction in each subject area. The Saturday Program was also designed to  address common areas of need in the ELL population as well as across the entire school.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The following structures will be put into place:    - A key staff member will be responsible for working directly with our ENL population to ensure data and individualized plans  are put into place to support their progress.  - Data from the practice performance exam and the MOSL exams will be shared with content teachers so they are aware of  student gaps/needs so they are better able to support their ENL students.  - Professional development will also be given to provide teachers with tools and strategies to support our ENL students.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Success of ELL specific programs is determined by a variety of measures. These include credit accumulation and Regents  passing rates for ELL students, especially as compared to the state requirements and comparative cohort  performance,  anecdotal reports from content area teachers, portfolio performance in different classes, rubrics, common core  standards in each subject area, and other scholarship data generated each marking period.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    - Content area teachers will be provided with the data to support ENL students with specific gaps in literacy and in content.  - The assigned ENL liaison will be responsible for meeting with teachers to provide support      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers review the NYSESLAT scores in September to guide their instruction.  In addition, teachers use their formal and  informal assessments.   The English and Social Studies teachers use conferencing to assist students with personal goals.  While  the Math teachers use assessment notebooks to track progress and move students.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Students typically progress through language acquisition and academic proficiency in patterns consistent with research.  Most  students acquire basic communicative skills over a period of 3-5 years and are developing their academic language proficiency  over a four to seven year span. Generally speaking, students' performance in speaking and listening progresses more quickly  than their abilities in reading and writing.   The data patterns show that the Reading and Writing scores are lower than the  Speaking and Listening.  The last two NYSITELL exams resulted in the students requiring Beginners services.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Information will be disseminated via professional development and grade team meetings during the school year.          Part IV: ELL Programming         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All explicit ESL instruction takes place in a free-standing, departmental model.      ESL groupings are ungraded. The ESL teacher makes use of flexible groupings, including heterogenous groupings by  native language and homogenous groupings based on language proficiency and/or grade level. All ESL students meet  together one period a day, which provides opportunities for small group instruction as well as for students at varying  levels of proficiency to interact with one another in an instructional "safe space" where they can test their language  proficiency, provide one another with support in content area work, and build collaborative relationships.  Additionally, students who are placed in the beginner and intermediate levels benefit from additional smaller classes  that allow them to focus on developing targeted skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Due to the programming of students in a tiered system of classes, all students are programmed to receive in excess of  the the mandated instructional minutes per level. Advanced students are programmed for 180 minutes of instruction.  Intermediate students are programmed for 360 minutes of instruction. Beginner students are programmed for for 420. All  students are programmed for ELA courses in English at their grade level--students at all levels receive 210 minutes of  instruction in ELA.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All ELL students are programmed for a regular course load that mirrors the courses taken by other students at their grade  level. Although teachers in the content areas are not ESL licensed teachers, they work with the ESL teacher to provide targeted  supports and scaffolds within their instruction. In addition, the ESL teacher infuses content area vocabulary and instruction in  the ESL class to aid students in functioning independently. All but one of our ESL students are either Advanced or  Intermediate, with all but one of the Intermediate students performing at the high end of the range. As such, most of the  scaffolds and approaches focus on helping students organize information and create structures for reading and writing in  English.              Curriculum for all content areas is fully aligned to the CCLS--teachers in these content areas meet regularly to revise and  strengthen curriculum and create scaffolds and supports for any students who may struggle to meet requirements. These  supports include graphic organizers, glossaries (including illustrated glossaries) to aid in comprehension of complex texts,  writing scaffolds including sentence starters and cloze paragraphs to facilitate note-taking, and the use of text coding,  annotation systems, and Cornell Notes to encourage student engagement with reading materials. Writing supports are created  to be used inter-disciplinarily, including standardized systems for instruction and assessment in content-specific writing tasks,  multiple opportunities to revise writing, and common rubrics that isolate specific skills for further development.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Teachers are given the option of allowing students to complete part or all of their assignments and projects in their native  language, as appropriate to the task and the students' language proficiency.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. The instructional plan for our SIFE students is under development. We plan to create a personal needs profile for each of  these students, targeting specific skill areas in math and ELA. These students have been assigned to receive AIS services  through our Saturday Scholars program, which provides targeted intervention in cross-curricular literacy and math skills with  an emphasis on problem solving and math-related writing.  These students have access to simplified texts in the ESL library.  b. For our 5 newcomers, we focus on building academic and content-area specific vocabulary, as well as structures to aid in  reading and writing independently. These students are encouraged to attend free tutorial sessions at the school during the  week and are offered the opportunity to participate in the Saturday Scholars Program   c. For ELL students who have received services for 4-6 years, we focus on developing profiency prior to becoming a long-term  ELL.   d. Our 5 long-term ELLs struggle with reading and writing; both were able to pass their listening and speaking assessments in  the spring and both are currently advanced in reading and writing. Instruction for them focuses on monitoring their literacy  performance in ESL and ELA courses closely, looking for opportunities to refine their skills in these areas, and providing  tutoring at will for both students. This is supported throughout the content areas through the school-wide instructional focus  on writing and portfolio based work, which provides explicit instruction in writing in every content area, as well as a focus on  the use of planning, review and revision of written work.   e. Former ELLs are offered support through the after school and Saturday School tutoring programs.  Time and a half for  exams, separate location for testing, bilingual glossaries for use during state exams, access to simultaneous use of English and  Alternate Language Editions of Regents exams, and the right to respond in their native language on native language editions of  the state test.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    The use of vocabulary words, graphic organizers, dictionaries, and leveled texts to assist students academically.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students are placed in the least-restrictive environment on a course by course basis in response to data from class  performance, test scores, student interest, and requirements outlined in each student's IEP. Due to the small size of the ELL  population at ACORN, even students mandated for small group instruction can benefit from the nature of the ESL class,  receiving targeted instruction and intervention from the ESL teacher and the related services providers to facilitate parallel  gains towards English proficiency as well as IEP goals. The special education and ESL teacher meet to discuss the language and  special education needs of each student at the end of every semester--based on student progress and interest, programming  recommendations are then made to ensure that the student is in the least restrictive environment on a course-by-course basis  in order to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers. This could mean, for example, that a student who is in an ICT setting  for English and participates in a general education setting for computer technology or visual art. The goal is for students to be  consistently moving towards less restrictive environments in every subject area while still receiving the appropriate level of  support in areas of struggle.  Some students have ICT for English and Math while others may have it in English, Math, Social  Studies and Science.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students in the ESL course are exposed to text and strategies designed to support and enhance students' performance in their  other courses. Specific vocabulary and content are taught in anticipation of the work they will be required to produce in other  courses. The ESL teacher works in close communication with teachers of other content areas to identify specific areas of need  and methods for intervention.   Bilingual dictionaries in Spanish and English are required for all students whose native language is Spanish. Students have  access to peer tutoring with students who speak their native language.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      PAdditional bilingual dictionaries will be provided for students in languages other than Spanish. Structured professional  development and workshops will be offered to help teachers of ELL students identify QTEL strategies to support students'  instruction in their specific content areas. ESL teacher and other staff will work together to identify technological supports  including native language websites and other resources that students may access independently or during class for  instructional support in various content areas.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ESL students are provided access to all school programs, including supplemental services such as the Saturday Scholars  program, which targets specific literacy skills to improve student performance in all subject areas. Announcements regarding  afterschool programs and activities are made in the ESL classroom,  and written descriptions of programs and activities are  sent home in translation.     Curriculuar Programs offered include:  Boys Block ESI advisory, AVID advisory, Law electives, Dance Elective, Computer  Technology Electives, Peer Mediation/Conflict Resolution     Extra Curricular Programs offered include: Basketball, Track, Soccer, Girl Power, Debate, Dance, Anime Club, Magic Club,      Services Offered:  9th Period Tutoring (Lab Style and Peer Tutoring), Saturday Regents Review, Saturday Scholars (literacy intervention), iLearn  Saturday Lab, Credit Recovery Programs,        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Students are supported using films, music, and images to help students establish context. Instruction in all classes, including  content areas, makes use of PowerPoint and SMART Board technology to promote interactive learning. The class library in ESL  allows students to access a broad array of literature and informational texts at their level of proficiency and in their areas of  interest.  Texts are selected with the intent of supporting students' acquisition of language skills as well as content-specific  knowledge.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language speakers on staff are available to provide support and outreach to students and families whose native  languages include Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Arabic.  The classroom library includes texts in Spanish, French, Russian, and  Chinese, to allow students the opportunity to expand their reading in their native language.       Following each unit assessment, students create a newsletter entry in their native that summarizes their learning in that unit.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         Students are able to work together to translate their learning in English into their native languages. Students are grouped  according to language acquisition level for this activity.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All classroom and instructional support and services are designed to support students in transitioning into high school and  building a successful high school experience. Texts that include lower-level vocabulary are developmentally appropriate for  adolescents and include engaging themes common to high school students: love, family, friendships, search for identity, etc.  All instructional supports are designed to assist language learners in engaging in rigorous college-preparatory coursework.  Students are frequently grouped within the ESL classroom according to grade level, to provide support and intervention  specific to the coursework they are currently enrolled in.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Students are supported using films, music, and images to help students establish context. Instruction in all classes, including  content areas, makes use of PowerPoint and SMART Board technology to promote interactive learning. The class library in ESL  allows students to access a broad array of literature and informational texts at their level of proficiency and in their areas of  interest.  Texts are selected with the intent of supporting students' acquisition of language skills as well as content-specific  knowledge.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students who are enrolled over the summer receive an introductory letter explaining the school and the ESL program and  outlining the programs and activities available.  New students meet with the APO to discuss school policies and procedures as  well as the ESL program. New students are paired with a student who shares the same native language and can act as a  personal guide to ACORN . The same on-boarding process if offered to students who enroll during the school year.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development and Support for School Staff  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL…  1. Our teachers receive a list of our current ELL students during our September and January Chancellor Professional  Development days. The staff receives information on student data to analyze areas their students may need assistance with to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         pass their classes or do well on exams. In addition, during the Chancellor PD days the administrative team provides staff  (guidance counselors, paraprofessionals, school aides and secretaries) with strategies and interventions to promote cultural  awareness, academic and social/emotional assistance. The last Monday of each month (10/30, 11/27, 12/25, 1/29, 2/26, 3/26,  4/30 & 5/28) the LEAD teachers and administrative team meet to discuss and identify strategies to improve instruction and  curricula, especially supports for our ELL and SWD. This in turn is turn keyed to the rest of the teaching staff during the  cohort/department meetings on Mondays.      The Guidance Department uses their PPT meetings to address specific needs of individual students, some of which are ELL.  Once a month during the Guidance Department meetings, the guidance counselors discuss supports that can be potentially  used with the ELL students.       We have who worked as Common Core Fellows who work with teachers (including our ELL teacher) to support them with  developing curricula and tasks specific to their student needs.  Teachers use their CMT and professional development time to  further develop their curricula and lessons to support the implementation of CCLS for all students.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As mentioned above, the instructional staff and support staff are continuously updated with ELL changes throughout the year  via department meetings and whole-faculty meetings.    During the year all of our teachers are given ELL training via Whole Faculty Meetings and smaller PD’s which will occur  during      Regents week and Chancellor PD days. A record of the PD’s are maintained via an agenda, archived materials.  The  Professional Development activities, which start in September, include specific data (names of ELLs, levels, NYSESLAT progress,  etc.),  strategies to support ELL learners that can be used in the General Education classroom and  how to build CCLS supports  for ELL learners to be reflected in curricula and lesson plans.    Teachers will continue to receive PD to comply with the 7.5 hours. The bulk of our PD will occur during the January Regents  week where teachers and support staff will be offered a series of three, one hour workshops on ELL strategies to specifically  support the CCLS standards and transition, an 1.5 hour workshop during the Chancellor’s PD Day in February, followed up with  a 1.5 hour Whole Faculty PD on ELL strategies the first Wednesday in March.

Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   All parents are welcomed into the school and invited to participate in the Parent Association. The school hosts an annual  Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate the different nationalities and cultures of our students. Families of students participate by  contribuing dishes and are invited to join their children at the school for the feast.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrea Piper, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

If there is more than one LAC, list all.     First Name    Last Name    Title    Has the LAC attended a   2018-19 training   The LAC was involved in  the development of this   conducted by the Field   plan? Yes/No          Language Access   Coordinator? Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      All parents/guardians of newly enrolled students fill out a Home Language Survey when enrolling their child. This  form is maintained as part of the student’s record and a copy in the ELL binder. If the parent/guardian indicates  on the HLIS that they would like to receive information from the school in their home language,forms being sent  home are translated either in written form to the parent/guardian. There are currently 13 ELLs at ACORN  Community High Schoo. The DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit will be utilized if a parent/guardian should  request these services. During the parent orientation, the parents provide requests for language preference and  they document their language preference on the emergency contact cards. The ATS Report of Preferred  Languages is updated regularly in order to maintain accurate information on parent language choices ( RAPO ATS  Report). Parent Blue Cards are also updated regularly to keep parent language choices current. Parent surveys are  given out by the parent coordinator in order to maintain accurate data on parent language choices.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75         2.

Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Approximately ninety-six  percent of the school’s  population reports English  as the primary language.  The remaining four  percent speak Arabic,  French, French-Hatian  Creole, Spanish and  Bengali. The school’s  demographic is made  available on the school’s  official DOE website and is  periodically reported in  our school’s newsletter.  Teachers whose parents  have elected to receive  information in their home  language have had this  information  communicated to them by  the coordinator. All other  language needs are met  through the utilization of  the DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
