The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The vision of PS/MS 43Q is that all children will learn in a nurturing and healthy environment. It is our responsibility as  educators and guardians of our students to foster such an environment. We must develop the whole child  academically, socially and physically. In order to ensure this our chosen curricula, standards, professional  development, parent workshops and overall school planning will center around preparing and equipping our students  to compete in the global marketplace.   The mission of PS/MS 43Q is to create a community of lifelong learners where high rates of literacy are achieved  through active student participation in an array of academic, scientific, artistic and technological activities. Through  high expectations and standards-driven instruction, our students will become responsible and contributing members  of a rapidly changing world. We are dedicated to sharing our school facility with the community organizations whose  purpose is to benefit children and their families. Through parent involvement and a commitment to education, we  believe every student can reach high standards of excellence.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/MS 43 is an elementary-middle school with 888 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 8.    We here at PS/MS 43 have instituted several DOE initiatives to enhance instruction and advance student learning.  Some of these initiatives are:   ● Algebra 4 All (A4A) - Improving math skills and outcomes for all of our students is at the heart of the Algebra for All  (A4A) initiative. To improve outcomes for all students, A4A will focus on three key goals:   1.  Work with elementary and middle schools to improve student readiness for Algebra and high school math   instruction;   2.  Support teachers to be successful in teaching pre-algebra coursework and Algebra; and  3.  Engage students and families to strengthen their capabilities and mindset to be successful.   ● Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) - Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) provides a  strong college-going culture that encourages students to think about their college and career plans.   ● College Access 4 All (CA4A) - Our school has adopted a "college preparatory culture" College Access 4 All (CA4A)  encourages students to expand their mindset around going to college and prepare them with the knowledge and  resources needed to understand how to navigate their journey to college from Middle School.    ● iRead - iRead is a digital foundational reading program designed to close the achievement gap early. We have  structured the program to give students individualized experiences that will ensure they master the alphabet,  phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency, while building a vocabulary and comprehension, and place all K-2 children  on a predictable path to reading proficiently by Grade 3.   ● STAR TRACK - The Queens School Anti Violence Program provides volunteer support from Assistant District  Attorneys from the Queens District Attorney's Office. They volunteer advisors visit classrooms, with a culminating trip  to courthouses and tennis courts. Our participating students had the opportunity to learn about how to play as a  team, how to work collaboratively and how to resolve conflicts peacefully. Through workshops, lectures and role- playing situations, students are schooled on the dangers associated with guns, drugs and violence. The students also  learn decision-making skills, including resistance to peer pressure, peaceful conflict resolution, and leadership       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      abilities. In addition, the STAR TRACK students are all encouraged to set goals for themselves and are given the  support they need to progress toward those goals.   ● Urban Advantage (UA) - Urban Advantage (UA) is a standards-based collaboration between Department of  Education (DOE) and science-rich cultural institutions including Bronx Zoo, Queens Botanical gardens, American  Museum of Natural History, and Hall of Science to improve students’ knowledge of science and engineering practices.  Drawing on the educational resources of the informal science community and its long-term commitment to science  education, the New York City UA program provides professional development for middle school science teachers and  opportunities for both students, teachers, and parents to engage in authentic science conducting investigations in  which they pose scientifically oriented questions, prioritize evidence, and develop logical explanations, which are  essential for understanding science. UA learning experiences align with the science standards and assessments in  school systems, including the New York City Department of Education’s Performance Standards, which define four  types of science investigations for student projects: controlled experiments, field studies, design projects, and  secondary research (using scientific data sets obtained by others).   ● The Young Mens' Christian Association(YMCA/Beacon) - PS/MS 43 is partnered with Community Based Organization  - The Young Mens' Christian Association(YMCA/Beacon) and other outside agencies to address the social-emotional  needs of our students. YMCA/Beacon operates an extensive after school program as well as on Saturdays, holidays,  school closures and summer to provide extra curricula activities for our students.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   27Q043, the “School by the Sea” is a professional teaching and learning community, where we pride ourselves on  meeting the diverse needs of our student body. Our school focuses on providing increased academic interventions  and social/emotional supports to the bottom third of our lowest performing students. The selection of students is  contingent upon their academic achievement, measured by proficiency in English Language Arts (ELA), mathematics,  and science assessments. The specific subgroup categories of Students with Disabilities (SWD), Limited English  Proficient, Hispanic and Economically Disadvantaged students have been carefully selected, given interventions and  monitored for academic progress throughout this school year.   Academic interventions that the school provides for these subgroups begins with careful assessments completed by  the classroom teachers, and if a student’s needs warrant more intensive supports, then they are referred to the  Dolphins on the Cusp/Academic Intervention Services Team, (DOC/AIS), Learning Support Team (LST), and/or School  Implementation Team (SIT). In addition the school provides during the school day interventions, Dolphins On the Cusp  (DOC) periods, where teachers will either pull, or push-into classes to provide academic support to students struggling  academically. We have also extended the school day for these subgroups by having them attend Dolphin Academy in  all four major subject areas, including 8th grade Algebra I Regents.   Many of our students need more than academic interventions, and this can be in the form of social/emotional  supports. Students have been given at-risk counseling with our school guidance counselors, social workers, school  psychologists and Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Specialist (SAPIS). We created a Dolphin Saturday  Therapeutic and Crisis Intervention (STACI), which meets on Saturdays for those students who have been previously  suspended, received a classroom removal, or whom have repeatedly been recommended for at risk counseling. For  those students whose needs require the most intensive Tier 3 support, we have created Behavior Support Plans,  Functional Behavior Assessments (FBA's) and Behavior Intervention Plans (BIP's). All of these interventions are given  to students with the goal of having them learn social skills that will transfer to both inside and outside of the  classroom, and increase their overall academic performance.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school has made growth in the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE), Tenet 2 – School  Leadership practices and decisions and Tenet 6 – Family and Community Engagement. Our school has created an  effective school leadership team where parents and staff become stakeholders in students’ educational goals. The  focus of this group is to collaboratively make decisions regarding the school direction, instruction and in-turn student  progress. Our parents and administration work closely together with one goal in mind and that is to lead the school to  success. School to Parent connection has increased. This has been made evident through parent participation and  involvement in school activities, reflecting a greater interest in the parent-school paradigm. Under Tenet 6 – Family  and Community Engagement we use every Tuesday for parent engagement where parents meet with teachers and  discuss students’ achievement and goals. Additionally, parents are invited to our school for celebrations and  enrichment.                    2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q043   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   901   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   N/A   X   N/A   X               Part 1b.

For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The school's strength in Tenet 3 lies in our school leader who ensures and supports the implementation of rigorous and  coherent curricula through the development of a curricula team which looks at, and creates unit plans to promote  coherence across grade levels , with all students.   Our 2016-2017 New York State Assessment data indicates that 15% met State standards on the New York State English  Language Arts test; 18% met State standards on the New York State math test. Data trends show they we are  consistently improving in Math, yet there was a slight decrease in English Language Arts.    Based on the Quality Review from May 2017 and the Principal Performance Observations our areas of focus are:   1.2 Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all  learners so that all students produce meaningful work products.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16      2.2 Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student  learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.   Based on Tenet 3 of the DTSDE rubric, teachers must develop and ensure that lesson plans include data-driven  instruction (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards and NYS Content  Standards, as well as address student achievement needs.   The priority need to be addressed in this area is to develop and ensure that lesson plans are solely based on specific  data driven protocols aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards and student need. To address this need we  have instituted the following:         Increased minutes within in each class period to move from an 8 period schedule to a 7 period schedule to  maximum instruction time;  Instruction and assessment designed for multiple entry points for all students in all subject areas so that  students are afforded the supports they need to meet and exceed the standards.;     Use of Data Wise & Collaborative Action Research Inquiry protocols to assess, analyze, and take action to   increase student achievement across all grades and content areas;     Engagement in structured inter-visitation protocols that will ensure a cohesive system for providing feedback to   students based on individual learning strategies.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.

These events provide families with the opportunity to have a open discussion with the  Principal, Assistant Principals, Social Emotional Team, Parent Coordinator, and UFT Chapter Leader.   Recognizing the critical role of parents as partners, our priority need is to increase the number and types of  opportunities for parents to stay actively involved in their children’s educational experience. In order to increase parent  participation, we are offering a wide variety of instructional and non-instructional workshops as well as regular  opportunities for parents to meet with their children’s teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46         contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

(Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title I School Improvement  1003(a)  Title I Priority and Focus  School Improvement Funds   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   N/A     24,888     151,713     255,466     N/A     12,366     5,361,873      N/A     x     x     x     N/A     x     x      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 27Q043, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       27Q043 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach,  communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of  the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In the 2017-18 school  year, our ENL/ELL population comprised 8% of our total student body.  In 2017, none of our  ENL/ELL population was proficient and 27% achieved level 2 in the New York State ELA  assessment and 1% of our ELLs were proficient and 24% achieved a level 2 in the Mathematics  portion.  Examining this data, it is evident that we must offer additional supports to our LEP  students to ensure academic progress, especially those ELLs with IEPs. To address these  concerns we have developed an after school program called, “Dolphin Academy”.  Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:    The students who will benefit from these additional supports are our LEPs in grades 3 through  8.  Approximately 60 students.  Schedule and duration:    The Dolphin Academy will be scheduled for after school from 2:20 pm until 4:40 pm, twice a  week on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Language of instruction:    The language of instruction is English.  The program will focus on providing academic  intervention for our LEPs in both ELA and mathematics.  Current NYSESLAT proficiency level  data will be utilized by the ENL teacher when scaffolding the content in English.  # and types of certified teachers:    There will be 2 certified math teachers, 1 certified ELA teacher, 8 Common Branch teachers  and 1 certified ENL teacher who is also certified in Common Branches to facilitate the  instruction.  Other staff supports include, 2 academic coaches will provide targeted professional  development for teachers and support with curriculum. The ENL teacher will utilize both the  push-in and pull-out models of instruction.  Using the push-in model they will focus on parallel  teaching, alternative  teaching, and station teaching.  Pull out instruction will be small groups of  students, no more than 5 in number, based upon “Data Wise” and reports from teachers and our  Learning Support team.  Types of materials:    We are using "Data Wise" to track academic performance of our ENL/ELL population in  common assessments throughout the grade bands.  Our assessment calendar highlights the dates  we will be assessing Fountas and Pinell for reading, Performance Series Reading Assessment,  Fry Sight Words, Word Generation Vocabulary, Ready NY ELA, Ready NY Mathematics  Assessments, Mental Math, Ready CCLS Math and common end of unit assessments and  tasks.  This data will be used by the teachers in the “Dolphin Academy” to target instruction  based on individual needs in small groups and one to one instruction.

In addition to this professional development, teachers will be provided extra instructional  support in Fundations- Wilson Language Training for younger grades, Teacher's College  Writing, and coaching in curriculum development as identified in our SCEP.  We are currently  working with School Data Corp and NYC Performance Series in supporting teachers how to use  formative assessments and data tracking to monitor student progress and improve lesson  planning and instruction with regards to Danielson's Domain component 3D; Using Assessment  in Instruction.     Teachers will continue to receive support from Literacy and Math in addition to our 2 AIS  teachers.  This support staff will work continue to work with instructional staff on Monday  during staff development time from 2:20 pm to 3:40 pm and during teachers' prep periods.     The ENL teacher (Ms. Williams), the Literacy Coach (Ms. Rhames) and the Assistant Principal  (Mr. Vitta) attended the Quality Teaching for English Learners(QTEL) summer institute and will  continue to provide professional development to teachers to support students who speak  languages other than English.    The ENL Teacher, Special Educations Teachers (Ms. Aull, Ms. Zittel, Ms. Hoehn, Ms. Harris),  Literacy Coach), and Assistant Principal (Mr. Robinson) will provide professional development  on the action research process and findings from the work done with the Collaborative Action  Research Project (CARP) Team in regards to Danielson's Rubric (1e) Designing Coherent  Instruction and how this domain correlates directly with domain 3C Engaging Students in  Learning.

We will continue  practices implemented in the 2017-2-18 school year as well as implement new practices.      We will focus on having student led conferences, where students are able to speak to their  academic progress and identify areas of need through careful self-analysis and portfolio  examination.  We will have monthly breakfasts with principal meetings, where parents are  invited to the school to meet with administrative staff to facilitate communication.  Our bilingual  parent coordinator, Mr. Cotto, will address ENL concerns at these meetings.  Communications  via letter and calendar items will be translated in Spanish to garner more engagement of our non- English speaking community.      One time a month on Tuesdays for 45 minutes, 8 sessions in total, we will conduct parent  engagement activities for ELLs, hosted by our ENL teacher, Ms. Williams.  She has attended  numerous professional developments with regards to ENL, Literacy, and Mathematics  instruction.  She is also a member of our schools Collaborative Action Research Project (CARP)  team.  These workshops will be listed on the school calendar in both English and Spanish.   Mr.  Cotto, our bilingual parent coordinator will attend these workshops to support translation at the  meetings.  The workshops will focus on helping parents support learning at home in all content  areas using various resources including, but not limited to online resources,  vocabulary  enrichment, NYSESLAT, ELA and Mathematics Assessments, and homework.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tools used to assess the literacy skills of our ELLs are Fountas and Pinnell, TC writing units, FRY Words,  ReadyNY CCLS Mock Assessments and ReadyGen Performance Tasks. Grade level writing assessments are done periodically  throughout the year. ELL Periodic Assessments, Performance Series ,NYC Performance Assessments, and the NYSESLAT are  also used to assess literacy skills of our students. Teachers use reading assessments to gain insights as to our students' areas of  strengths and weaknesses. This information is used to gain more knowledge on how to differentiate our lessons to meet our  students' individual needs. Data from these assessments is used to improve programs at PS/MS 43.  Data from the NYSESLAT  reveals that there are gains made from the expanding level to the commanding level.  Data shows that the entering and       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      emerging students need more support through differentiated lessons and strong vocabulary development. Fountas and Pinnell  data reveals that although there are gains made throughout the grades, students are having difficulty comprehending non- fiction texts.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have an assessment calendar with Mock Assessments and data entry into an online Database. Teachers utilize this to plan  units and amend the pacing calendar as necessary .      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The successes of our programs for ELL's are evaluated through student performance on state tests, Periodic Assessments, the  NYSESLAT and their individual English proficiency.The main focus is on the NYSESLAT. Students' scores are analyzed and  compared to the scores obtained the previous year. For example, the results of the 2013/2014 NYSESLAT would be compared  to the results of the 2014/2015 NYSESLAT scores. This data is used to place students into appropriate groups according to  proficiency levels and needs.  We also evaluate reading and writing skills as demonstrated at each grade , year to year class  test scores, teacher observations and parental observations and feedback to determine the successes of our ELL programs.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We provide AIS to our students based upon assessment data. We have after school programs specifically for ELLS, and for  select students. We also have a Learning Support Team and RTI teacher to address students' learning needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers will use data from multiple sources to inform decisions and various tools are used to uncover critical information. To  identify the many factors influencing educational outcomes for an ELL student, there are different categories of information to  analyze such as language background, acculturation, educational and experiential background, values/norms, and higher-order  thinking skills. We look at students’ academic strengths and weaknesses,  proficiency in both languages and areas of  instructional strengths and weaknesses as well as the match between instruction and students’ needs.  English Language  Learners who score below specified levels of performance on the NYSESLAT will be given support services based on various  factors. Such factors include the number of years of instruction in a dual language or ENL program, English and home language  literacy, SIFE status, English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs, content area teacher/ENL teacher  recommendation, parent/guardian request and sample of student work. In September of each year, all students, including ELLs  receive baseline assessments in ELA and Math to determine their functional levels. Based on the assessment results :   Tier 1: All students are addressed through a differentiated approach to learning that is data driven. Instructional Practices are  aligned to the Common Core State Standards, the DOE Instructional Expectations and the Danielson Framework. The focus of  instruction is on promoting language and literacy development.  New vocabulary and key concepts are previewed to provide  background knowledge. Utilizing Fundations; Phonemic awareness is taught Reading fluency is gained through modeling,  shared reading, choral reading and partner reading. Content area texts are used for reading comprehension. Students are  questioned to promote critical thinking.  Students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their comprehension through  multiple methods.  Tier2: Students at this level are provided with after school Dolphin Academy and small group tutoring to help improve student  outcomes. Further, students will be identified as at risk based on their State Assessments, Performance Series, Periodic  Assessments and teacher feedback that indicate they are performing below expected levels on ELA and math.   Tier 3: After a 10-30 week duration, the students who have not made adequate progress are referred to the Learning Support  Team  for further review and will continue to receive targeted, small group instruction until the team recommendation has  been made.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         Data patterns across performance levels reveal that 15.5% of ELLs are in the entering level.  78.6% are in grades K-4 and 21.4%  are in grades 5-8.  ELLs that are in the emerging level are 17% with 33.3% in grades 2-3 and 66.7% in grades 5-8.  27% of Ells  are in the transitioning level.  75% of students in the transitioning level are in grades K-4 and 25% are in grades 5-8. 29% of  students are in the expanding level with 56.8% in grades K-4 and 43.2% in grades 5-8.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We have ELL monthly meetings between the teacher and administrator to disseminate data and review student needs with  regards to programming, curriculum and instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL program is designed to support ELLs in second language development. P.S./M.S. 43Q has a freestanding ENL  program where students receive their instruction in English.  The number of ENL instructional units are dependent  upon their score on the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT and what level they have achieved as required by CR Part 154.2  Regulations. Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core  content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core  content area instruction. Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction  which is delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and common branch or content area) or co- teaching by a  certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies).  Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language development  using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of  units of integrated ENL.  P.S./M.S.43 uses a pull-out and pushin models to accommodate the needs of their ELL students and to complement  their classroom instruction.  ENL is taught through an integrated curriculum that includes reading, writing, listening  and speaking.  Ongoing communication between the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers helps to ensure that  content based ENL instruction is complimentary to what students are learning in their mainstream classrooms.  Classroom teachers and the ENL teacher fill out weekly forms which enables both the classroom and the ENL teacher  to be aware of the skills that are being taught and strategies that can be used for all ELLs.  The ENL teacher uses the  curriculum and modifies her teaching to make the content understandable for ELLs.   She teaches language and  content cohesively.  Lessons are developed to include language objectives in every content lesson.  Students are  typically grouped based upon grade, and proficiency level whenever possible. Students  benefit from being placed in  the same groupings as expanding and commanding to develop their language skills.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     None   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      None      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ENL teacher analyzes the results of the NYSESLAT scores to determine the proficiency levels of each student. Groups  are then created based on the language level and grade level of students. The ENL program provides instruction in English  using ENL methodologies for a specific amount of time as determined by scores achieved on the NYSESLAT or  NYSITELL.  Students who are in the Entering level of proficiency receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction each week with stand- alone ENL for 180 minutes and integrated ENL/ELA for 180 minutes.  Emerging students receive 360 minutes of instruction  with 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL ,180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction, and 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL or  integrated ENL/Content Area.  Transitioning students receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  90 minutes will be  integrated ENL/ELA instruction and 90 minutes can be stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL.  Students who are in the Expanding  proficiency level will receive a total of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  The certified ENL teacher  pulls out students from their classroom to provide services in grades K-8 or pushes into the classroom to work with them when  appropriate.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the ENL program, English language instruction is utilized to deliver grade appropriate content that is aligned to the  Common Core Learning Standards. Depending on the students ENL level; additional scaffolding is provided by the teacher  utilizing more vocabulary instruction which is differentiated for the different leveled ELL's (ie: more pictures for entering level  ELL's). Content Areas are taught for different entry points for these students. In the Dual Language program, content is  delivered in two languages, Spanish and English. Science is provided by a cluster teacher in English. A thematic approach to  teaching is utilized in the content areas with ENL methodology and support provided. Instructional approaches used include  graphic organizers, t-charts, modeling, visuals, pre-teaching of content area vocabulary and developing prior knowledge.  Scaffolding and differentiated instruction is based on student proficiency level and collaborative planning by classroom and  content teachers.  Native language support, such as the use of bilingual dictionaries and materials in the native language are  offered.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELL's are appropriately evaluated in their native language throughout the year. Classroom teachers administer teacher  created assessments that are aligned with instruction that is provided.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      A. Currently, there are no SIFE students.    B. English Language Learners in US schools less than three years are given intensive mandated ENL instructional time as  prescribed by CR Part 154 and support by their classroom teacher as well. These students also receive a variety of ENL  instructional strategies and activities to assist them in meeting the Common Core State Standards. The strategies utilized by  the ENL teacher include Cooperative Learning, the Language Experience Approach, the Cognitive Academic Language Learning  Approach, and Differentiated Instruction. These activities are utilized during theme based activities using trade books, art  activities, music, storytelling, and the use of technology. These students utilize the technology program, Imagine Learning,  which focuses on web based instruction, practice and assessment to assist in language support and improved performance on  State Assessments.     C. Ell's receiving 4-6 years of service will continue to receive the mandated instructional time based on their NYSESLAT scores       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      and proficiency levels. They receive small group instruction several times a week via a pull-out model. During small group  instruction these students receive reinforcement and re-teaching based on their instructional needs. The teacher uses both  guided and skill focused lessons to inscrease their knowledge and proficiency. These students also receive literacy and  language support during our 90 minute Balanced Literacy Block using ReadyGen and The ReadyGen ELL Scaffolding Manual  facilitated by the classroom teacher. The use of tiered activities allows teachers to tailor the instruction for these students  during this time to meet their individual needs. These students invited to attend the Saturday School Program.   D. Long Term ELL's are offered a variety of academic intervention services. These students are invited to attend the Saturday  School Program. Teachers incorporate many strategies during this time to foster differentiated individualized instruction  through the use of tiered activities.  They receive small group instruction based on their individual needs to assist in meeting  and exceeding Common Core State Standards. Study Island, one of our technology programs offered, is also available to these  students where they are exposed to rigorous academic content that focuses on the Standards which enables improved  performance in all skill areas tested.   E. Students that have reached the commanding level on the NYSESLAT continue to receive ENL services for an additional two  years. They will have 90 minutes of integrated ENL in ELA or other content area.  The classroom teacher and the ENL teacher  articulate to ensure continued progress of these students. These students also receive the testing accomodations that current  ELL's receive, for two years.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?            Students with special needs participate in ENL instruction as mandated by their IEP's. The instruction they receive is  modified as needed depending on their abilities. Students receive additional scaffolding and support to enable them to fully  participate. Our school utilizes the common core-aligned Ready Gen program which has scaffolding for ELLs for each lesson.  The school aslo uses Go Math which is common core aligned and provides differentiated activities to promote learning of  content for all learners. Students also utilize the Imagine Learning Program which is an interactive web based program which  provides native language support as needed while building English Language Skills.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          The ELL's-SWD's participate in all school wide programs including ENL. Their IEP services are provided in their dominant  language. Depending on th program recommendations students will be placed in either SETSS, ICT, or self contained. Within  these classes instruction is modified utilizing our ELL accommodation planner. Our ENL teacher works on these modifications  and shares them with the classroom teachers, who implement them as necessary. Our students' annual goals are infused in  lesson plans and are also supported in ENL instruction through activities that correlate to the language goal, and learning  target.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs include Imagine Learning and Dolphin Academy.  Imagine Learning is a computer  generated ELL reading program that individually targets and addresses phonemic awareness, decoding, listening, vocabulary,  fluency and comprehension with language support in Spanish.  Small group instruction and Saturday Academy are all offered in  English. At risk counseling is also provided to ELLs by the Guidance Counselors. Our targeted intervention program for math is  Go Math and for reading we use the Ready Gen program with teacher modifications as needed.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Integrated ENL program will be utilized across the grades.  A continued emphasis has been placed on differentiated instruction  and tiered activities in all classes, which enables us to meet the academic needs of our ELL's. We have also made  improvements by utilizing the Push in model of ENL, to ensure that skills transfer from small group pullout, to the  classroom setting.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All ELLs have equal access to all school programs. ELL's are given the opportunity to participate in any program that is  beneficial to their level of proficiency, interest and learning style. They are also offered equal access to any after school or  Saturday school program including ELA and Math preparation classes. ELL students are also a part of our Dolphin classes       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  A variety of instructional materials are utilized to support the learning of ELLs. This includes big books, guided readers, and  shared readers in both English and Spanish. Each grade level has a Scaffolding Guide for ELLs. There are native language  libraries in all the DL classes. Leveled libraries are used in all classrooms. Additional materials used in the ENL classroom  include Prentice Hall Regents ESL set, Highpoint Success in Language, Oxford Picture Dictionary for Content Areas, Language  and Learning: Building Content Area and Academic Vocabulary, and Connecting Vocabulary: Build vocabulary through reading  and skill based activities and Imagine Learning computer software. These materials are used appropriately according to ELL  subgroups. Native language support is also provided for the ELLs as part of the Imagine Learning program where instructions  are given to students in their native language as they get started. All students have access to online dictionaries with  translation in their native language.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In Integrated ENL native language support is provided through computer programs, picture dictionaries, books in students'  native language and translation websites. Our program emphasizes the importance of placing the learner's native language  and cultural background at the center. Our library has a reading and listening center with Spanish and English resources.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and resources correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels. PS/MS 43 provides ENL services in grades  K-8.  Our pacing guides and unit planners assist our ENL teacher to ensure the students are working on current grade level  content, while providing ELL strategies and supports.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Simone a. Nicholas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS MS 43                                                                              School DBN: 27Q043  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Each September PS/MS 43Q conducts the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine the preferred  language of communication for students’ families. In addition Our Limited English Proficient Parents are identified  via our Student Emergency Contact Cards (Blue Cards) and are interviewed during any new student registration.  Classroom teachers also ask their students which language their parents/guardians are most comfortable  communicating in. In addition, the school community is interviewed to see what school based documents parents  would benefit from receiving in their home language. Input is garnered from all stakeholders such as the principal,  assistant principals, parent coordinator, ENL teachers, classroom teachers, PTA, students' families and the  surrounding community. This data is then compiled in ATS and informs us as to which students should receive  translated documents. These documents may include, but are not limited to letters , notices and school calendars  into the corresponding languages for effective communication between the school and students' homes.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         2.
