This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The EPIC High School model integrates a combination of design elements, practices, structures, and resources to  ensure that students graduate with: (1) positive sense of self, (2) an “ I can...” mentality, and (3) the capacity to  transform the world around them having experienced a rigorous, comprehensive, coherent and supported education.  Additionally, the schools promote the values of empowerment, personalization, inclusion and service, collective work,  continuous growth and cultural relevance (EPIC).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         Born out of the NYC Young Men’s Initiative, EPIC Schools challenge all students to dream big and support them in  designing their future. We recognize that each student is an individual, and therefore provide a series of learning  experiences that equip young people to walk their unique paths. We honor and integrate the cultures of our  communities to make learning relevant, responsive, and accessible, as we develop citizens with a positive sense of  self, ready to stand for social justice.   Mission Statement   All graduates of EPIC Schools will be college and career ready as we provide a meaningful pathway to lifelong learning  for every student. By fostering the boldness to dream and by developing a commitment to inner growth and outward  transformation, our graduates will be ready to design their own futures .    EPIC High Schools emphasize three key areas of work: practice, people and place.    I. PRACTICE: Culturally relevant and purposeful learning experiences leading to the mastery of skills    ● Competency-based framework integrating academic, social-emotional, college and career-readiness learning goals.   ● Personalized learning pathways that challenge students while providing them with targeted support.   ● Ongoing and varied assessments that afford students multiple and diverse opportunities to achieve and  demonstrate mastery.   ● Integrated technology and data use to personalize learning and facilitate access to resources.   ● Early College and workplace learning opportunities for students that form a “readiness bridge” into post-secondary  opportunities.   ● Youth development practices and strategies that support students through mentoring, rites of passage and  restorative justice.   II.

III. PLACE: Culturally relevant environments that nurture growth, community and positive identity    ● Community-based partnerships connecting services, supports and real-world learning opportunities.   ● Advocacy and activism that surface and address constraints that hinder student growth.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      ● Family engagement that ensures real partnership and shared leadership by the community.   ● Support services and operations systems that remove barriers to learning for students.   ● Built environments that are intentionally designed to support transformational learning.               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Resource/Organization List   The development of EPIC High Schools is a product of wide research and thought partnership with numerous experts  and organizations across the relevant domain areas. Additionally, EPIC is forging strategic alliances with local and  national organizations that will support both the implementation of these schools as well as broader advocacy around  policies related to Black and Latino youth.

This year we will be focusing heavily on consistent rigor across classrooms.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have an unusually large number of students who have IEPs. Their needs vary from behavior to academic ability  and they need more individualized attention from staff. Many students struggle with reading comprehension,  decoding, dealing with breaking complex problems into parts.    We also have a growing population of ENL students who are learning English as a new language. These students'  needs include language acquisition, oral language supports, and literacy skills in the target language.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Areas of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school will focus in 2018-2019:   (1) Rigorous Instruction   By June 2019, EPIC High School North teachers and supporting staff will implement common assessment  benchmarks and systems for tracking mastery. This work will be measured by students achieving a 6% increase in  CC Algebra I and a 7% increase in CC English Language Arts examinations. (QR 2.2).       (2) Collaborative Teams   This is the area in which the school has made the most progress in the last year.   By June 2019, a fairness committee comprised of multiple stakeholders (students, community members, family,  and staff) will be established and in charge of tracking and upholding our restorative practices. All community   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      stakeholders (parents, staff and students) will be invited into the tuning process to ensure our curriculum is  culturally responsive, with the result being a 5% increase in daily attendance. (QR 4.2).      (3) Effective Leadership.    By June 2019, school leaders will collaborate with advisers through four check-ins in September, November,  February, and April to track each students' individual pathway to graduation, resulting in 100% of the members of  the Senior class having an individualized graduation plan crafted by an adviser, supported by a specially selected  peer, with action steps tracked on a weekly basis.      (4) Supportive Environment   By June of 2019, 100% of EPIC High School North staff will have a common definition of restorative practices inside  and outside of the classroom.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     This year the school will be focusing on a professional learning calendar that will engender a common definition of  rigor that is based upon student work. While our attainments and competencies ensure that all instruction is aligned  to the Common Core, there is more work that needs to be done around producing a schoolwide college-ready  definition of mastery. Data sources cited include our Quality Review, NYC school survey data and Central Review.   Strengths:     The instructional model is competency-based and designed for students to work towards fulfillment of      Common Core aligned learning targets.  Learning experiences are presented in the form of performance tasks requiring students to demonstrate  knowledge and skills through the completion of interrelated activities.      Technology is used to personalize learning so that each student has access to necessary material, resources   and assignments in order to work in ways consistent with individual learning needs.      Parents are a part of the competency process and rate students at student-led conferences and end of the   year capstone projects, using rubrics.    Needs:     Teachers review and assess planned assignments against a common set of criteria that consider cultural   relevance, opportunities for collaboration, and scaffolds.      Teachers need support developing complex, multi-part performance tasks and challenges that are Common   Core aligned and reflective of varying levels of rigor, particularly in mathematics and literacy.     Teachers need support ensuring that standards for rigor and deadlines are consistent across classrooms   Teachers need support in maintaining high standards when students struggle to meet deadlines and  standards.     Teachers need support providing opportunities for revision based on feedback linked to specific competencies   and attainments that are Common Core aligned (how to revise, enhance, deepen work, etc.)        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy  is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 27Q334, in  compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their  children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as  trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   27Q334 Epic High School North will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   27Q334, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess and guide our ELLs, teacher-created projects are utilized. The school embraces a mastery based learning approach,  thus, there are many projects. The projects are frontloaded and created to enable students to learn through self-discovery.  Within each project, there are formative assessments to ensure that the students are on track to completing their project and  to provide further resources. In classes, teachers check-in with students one-on-one and as a class as a whole to see how far  along the students are progressing.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support the ELLs in the school, we provide push-in/integrated services as well as a standalone class for the ELLs that have  scored entering/emerging on the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT tests. By pushing into classes, we maintain a heterogeneous group. This  helps the ELLs feel included within their classes and also provides additional support to both the teacher and the students.  These services are provided in order to meet the required minutes each ELL needs to be serviced.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44           On top of ESL services, the school provides remedial English courses that can be built into students schedules, to further help  them improve in their reading comprehension.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To identify the baseline, progress and other areas of need, teachers provide all students with rubrics. With each project, there  are rubrics that all students utilize because they are aware that the rubrics are what the teachers will grade their work on. The  rubrics will also show what is expected of them.     The ELLs will also be provided with a rubric. Based on their proficiency level and a discussion with the student, content  teacher, and the ESL teacher, the rubric may be modified in order to best push the student.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    ?     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   To evaluate and inform our ELL programs, the NYSESLAT, Regents, and their content class grades are used. The school as a  whole emphasizes on oral presentations, rigorous research, and group work to develop students use of academic language as  well as interpersonal skills. Our approach is to ensure all students will be college-ready when they graduate.  The ENL program  will also continue to work towards this goal.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to ensure that the ELLs are being supported in class, teachers are encouraged to have open communications in order  to best assist the students. Teachers are asked to share their student's progress with the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher can  then provide feedback on what adjustments could be made in order to make the class more inclusive, such as providing  visuals, sentence frames, a vocabulary list of the words to be used in class a day or two before the actual class, etc.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered in a standalone ENL class by the ENL teacher/coordinator, as well as a push-in/integrated  model by the ENL teacher and an ELA teacher/ a content teacher, dependent on the services the ELL students need  (based on their proficiency level). The ELLs proficiency levels are determined by NYSITELL/NYSESLAT results.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school, epic High School North, encourages a more heterogenous model. Thus, all ELL students are provided with a push- in/integrated service, primarily in their ELA class. For those who are entering ELL students, the ENL teacher provides at least  180 minutes of standalone services; for emerging ELL students, they are provided with 90 minutes of standalone services. In  order to ensure that all students are being provided their minutes, some entering/emerging ELL students may be mixed  together, while the transitioning/expanding ELL students will be mixed together.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In core content classes, teaching and learning is organized to help students master both academic and social/emotional skills.  Students are encouraged to work together - either in groups or pairs - to complete the given classwork. All across the board,  teachers are in constant communication with each other in order to best deliver content. Each content course aligns with the  New York State Learning Standards as well as in alignment with the Common Core State Standards. To make content  comprehensible and help foster language development,      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   At the beginning of the school year, all new incoming students are presented with a home language survey (in the preferred  native language if available). This provides the school with the correct home language code, and it also provides us with an  initial understanding of the student's background knowledge. Students and parents are then interviewed by the ENL teacher. If  the home language survey indicates a language other than English, then the students are eligible to be given the  NYSITELL exam. The NYSITELL exam determines the students' proficiency level in English. At the end of the school year,  all ELLs will be required to take the NYSESLAT exams. This exam is to determine their acquirement of the English language  throughout the school year. In preparation for the NYSESLAT, students are provided with intensive instruction classrooms and  after-school tutoring sessions, if needed. The NYSESLAT test is administered by the ENL coordinator and another content  teacher, in a separate location (i.e., library) with necessary testing modifications for Special Education ELLs.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE - there are currently no SIFE students within the school building. However, if there were SIFE students, then we would  provide high interest reading texts. They would also work extensively on their literacy skills through paired/group work, use of  visual aids, audio, and videos.      b. Newcomer - students are encouraged to work in groups, hence they will be part of a group with at least one other person  that speaks their native language. They are also provided with leveled work, such as high-interest, low-level readers that are  grade appropriate. In their standalone classes, they work on vocabulary development and translation from native language to  English. They work on developing their listening and speaking skills as well. ENL teachers coordinate with content-area  teachers and help them develop scaffolded activities: templates for writing, audio books, bilingual dictionaries, and after- school tutoring.    c. Developing - students are encouraged to work in groups, hence they will be part of a group with at least one other person  that speaks their native language. They are also provided with leveled work that has been scaffolded - provided with graphic  organizers to further support them in organizing their thoughts, sentence frames to help them start their papers, etc. Students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      work on analysis of literature with close reading assignments, journal writing, scaffolded essays assignments. The ENL teacher  will push-in to classes to further assist and clarify throughout the day, utilizing the vocabulary words being taught in content  classes. After-school tutoring can be offered to further prepare the students to succeed in their classes, and to allow teachers  to give the students one-on-one feedback on how to further improve their writing.    d. Long Term - students are encouraged to work in groups, hence they will be part of a group with at least one other person  that speaks their native language. Long-term ELLs are usually in need of ENL services because of truancy or poor attendance.  Those that do not attend school regularly, collaboration with content teachers, ENL teacher, and the guidance department is  set up in order to discuss long-range plans, which may include counseling, credit recovery programs, transfers to alternative  settings and to GED programs. Long-term ELLs who do attend school regularly receive instruction in English. Teachers  formatively assess students to identify areas that are in need of improvement. Students are encouraged to use the habits of  effective readers, such as to read and reread, participate in think-alouds, discussions, and group work. The long-term ELLs in  our school place mostly in the Expanding level. Efforts are made to have students reflect on their own language learning  process and experience and discover ways to improve.    e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status - for at least two years following the school year in which a student is  exited from ELL status, former ELLs receive targeted instruction from their content area teachers who work in collaboration  with the ENL teachers.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     Content subjects are delivered in English. Group work is encouraged in each class, to further acclimate the ELLs in the English  language. For newcomer ELLs, they are paired with another bilingual student (if able) to assist in the explanation of the given  class work. Content-area teachers also collaborate with the ENL teacher on a weekly/bi-weekly basis, or informally during PD- activities. The ENL teacher reinforce content material within the standalone class. Extensive use is made of graphic organizers,  charts, outlines, visuals and video, as well as collaborative group work with content area teachers. ENL teacher also relies on  the Common Core Standards and Regents Exams to determine grade level appropriate materials and skills to focus on in the  classroom.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  At the school, an effort is made to place ELL-SWDs in the least-restrictive environment. The school follows an inclusion model  with students mainstreamed into general education classes for most of their content-area classes. Teachers have grade-level  meetings at least once a week to meet and discuss effective instructional strategies and student progress in order to promote  cross-content collaboration and uniformity among the subject-area teachers. Classes with high concentrations of ELL-SWDs are  also supported with the ENL teacher pushing-in/co-teaching the class. The school also offers ICT classes that are co-taught by  the content area teacher and a member of the Special Education department for students that require additional support in  certain subject areas. Most often ELL-SWDs are identified as high-need students and receive the appropriate in class and  supplementary interventions.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In content areas of ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies, beginning level ELLs receive a lot of modeling, graphic organizers,  visuals, and sentence frames in their native language whenever possible. Beginner level ELLs are often paired with another  student who speaks their language and is proficient in the content area material.  Supplementary materials in their native  language are used when available such as math texts, science materials, and graphic novels for ELA and Social  Studies.  Intermediate and Advanced level students are encouraged to use English dictionaries and utilize English as much as  they can.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      N/A?     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are not segregated in our school - we have a heterogeneous mix of students in each classroom. Students receive the  support they need in class due to the fact that there are Special Ed. teachers pushing in to service those with IEPs, while the  ENL teacher pushes in to support the ELLs. The content teacher, special ed. teacher, and the ENL teacher all communicate and  collaborate to reach each student.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All students receive a chromebook at the beginning of the school year. All students are responsible to bring their chromebook  to school. In the classes, students are allowed to use their chromebook to assist them in their class work. The ELLs are  encouraged to use their chromebook for translation purposes if needed, however each beginner ELL is paired up with another  student that is both proficient in their native language, as well as the material. Aside from chromebooks, students are also  exposed to various forms of technology (i.e. SMART Board ) and taught basic computer literacy skills such as Microsoft Word  and PowerPoint. Dictionaries and glossaries (when available) are used in the content area classes.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Beginner ELLs are generally paired with another student that is proficient in the native language as well as in English. They, as  well as teachers that are bilingual, provide translations and explanations orally to the students. During Regents Exams,  students are also offered the exam in their language when available.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources are in alignment with students’ ages and grade levels. The incoming Freshman students,  especially those that also have an IEP, are given the highest level of support within the school. Those students are given the  accommodations mandated in their IEPs and given the correct hours of ENL instruction. They are also further supported by the  school through the school's summer bridge program and extra help after-school. As students gets older, they are given more  targeted support in order to help them succeed in their Regents exam, and meeting the requirements for graduation.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Some of our staff are bilingual and are available to assist newly enrolled ELLs. Throughout the school year, teachers monitor  the students to identify strengths and weaknesses so that students can receive the appropriate help.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish classes are offered to our students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Each fall the school holds a parent orientation night. Parents have the opportunity to meet with the teachers individually.  Letters containing the language proficiency assessment results are given to students to notify the parents. Each letter contains  the email address of the ENL teacher for parents to utilize if they have any questions or concerns they would like addressed.  Bilingual staff members are also available for translation as needed.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, DAVID WEINBERG, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   EPIC High School North                                                                              School DBN: 27Q334  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
