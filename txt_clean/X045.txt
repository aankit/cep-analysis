The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  Mission Statement   Section 4: SCEP Overview      Our goal is to ensure our students become independent thinkers and learners, who are capable of achieving even  faced with challenging work who are and who take pride in their accomplishments. To this end teachers will be  purposeful in planning learning activities that are aligned with intended instructional outcomes and who have high  expectations for the student work product. To accomplish this teacher will employ the use of diverse activities to  convey the educational value of what the students are learning.     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Middle School 45 is proud of our diverse school population. We service 716 students grades 6-8. Within our  population, 78% are Latino(a), 16% Black and 4% White. We have 120 students who are English as a New Language  (ENL) and 140 Students with Disabilities (SWD). Our community collaborations are many and assist in promoting  positive student social and emotional health as well as academic success. Our primary mental health partner is the  Montefiore clinic. This clinic provides mental and physical health supports and encourages families to participate in  care plans together. Middle School 45 relies on our educational consultants to help develop our teachers into ever  more proficient and effective educators. We collaborate with Learning Centered Initiatives (LCI), Middle School  Quality Initiative (MSQI), and Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) to provide teacher coaching and development of our  Professional Learning Communities (PLC). We use the Datawise approach to using assessment in planning and  instruction. We use this format to pinpoint problem of practice then develop targeted interventions to improve  planning and instruction. Other collaborations include ties to Good Sheppard Services, Fordham University, City  Squash, 21st Century and Gear UP. We partner with Beacon Good Sheppard our CBO to provide a welcoming  environment both after school, Saturdays and in the summer to our students. Through these connections we look to  strengthen the bond we have with parents and community always seeking to increase trust and collaboration.   The Thomas C. Giordano Middle School has been educating the children in the Belmont community for over one  hundred years. We are a unique school community in having provided education to our neighborhood children across  ten decades. Our close proximity to Fordham University as well as other cultural institutions like the Bronx Zoo and  the Botanical Gardens allows for a diverse backdrop in which we operate our community school. The close proximity  of these cultural and educational settings allows frequent visits enriching the lives of our school children and their  families. Inviting families to attend and participate in these educational experiences strengthens the bond we have  with parents and community.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have two sub groups in particular that need our focus. These include our ENL and SWD populations. These groups  comprise 18 and 19 percent of our student population respectively. The ENL students range in those that are new to  the country to those that have been in the United States for multiple years but still have difficulty passing the  NYSESLAT. Similarly we have a range of students classified with disabilities from those in self-contained to those who  are in collaborative team teaching classes to those who get resource or related services. What we find among these  populations is that they are very different in what each individual needs. When we look carefully at each student we  see an instructional program emerge that can best suit each student's needs. These two sub groups struggle to  perform at proficiency level on the state exams. On the 2018 State ELA exam, 14% of our SWD were proficient. This is  an increase from 4% the previous year. 6% of our ENL's are proficient. This is an increase from 2% the previous year.  In math 2.6% of our students were proficient, this is an increase in 2.6% from the 2017. 1.4% of our ENL's were  proficient, this is an increase of .7% from 2017. To move our students further with these results we need to give these  students small group instruction that is scaffolded to meet their needs.   In addition to these sub groups we have students who are at-risk. These are children who are below level in reading  and or math as per their state test score. Academically at-risk youth need to be identified by their teachers and  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      targeted for additional intervention both in the classroom and for AIS services. We also find the before and after- school programs can provide additional services for our ENL, SWD and at-risk students. As in all areas, we look to  incorporate parent involvement as we know school success is greatly increased with parent support.      4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   With reference to the Framework for Great Schools, Middle School 45 (MS 45) received celebration points from our  Principal Practice Observation (PPO). Specifically highlighted was how - 1.1 we are pushing to increase teacher  leadership while setting forth structures to support this work, this speaks to our work in Effective Leadership. Our  push for purposeful adjustments and increasingly more rigorous alignment of the curricula to the benchmarks of the  CCLS was an area of celebration. Also highlighted in this area for Collaborative Teachers was our use of Datawise in  the common planning and Professional Learning Communities (PLC). The School Quality Guide for 2017-18 supports  this as we saw an increase from 2.04 in 2017 on the School Survey to 3.60 in 2018 for Collaborative teachers. In terms  of Supportive Environment we were celebrated in the PPO for our mentoring programs. Our scope and sequence  created for all content areas was an additional area celebration, this speaks to Rigorous Instruction. The School  Quality Guide shows an increase in survey scores for Strong Family Community Ties as we increased from 2.28 in 2017  to 3.00 in 2018. We do know that this number is below than the District and City average.   During the 2018-2019 school year we will continue to engage all our students especially our English as New Learners  (ENL) and Students With Disabilities (SWD) in rigorous and engaging instruction through a focus on the common core  curriculum in all content areas. We will continue and improve our approach to teaming - where our teachers and  classes are organized into grade level teams to allow for more collaboration between teachers. In addition we will  continue to implement an inquiry approach to all of our team meetings thus strengthening teacher practices and  decisions. Teachers will meet once a week during the school day in grade level teams by content area to look at  students work, analyze data and make curriculum adjustments. We will come together in Professional Learning  Communities to look at assessments, student work and determine next steps that will impact instruction and  learning., we implement Datawise practices to ensure our protocols are effective. Middle School 45 is invested in the  use of the Danielson rubric to ensure quality teaching across our staff. As a school we look at student data to  determine areas of strength and need to inform our teaching. In particular our data continues to reveal only slight  progress of our ENL and SWD populations as revealed in the New York State (NYS) exams. For ELA both SWD's and  ENL's had less than 5% growth and for math these populations had less than 2% growth as compared to the previous  year. As a school we need to enhance our approach to scaffolding instruction and differentiating tasks so these  students can demonstrate improved learning outcomes. We will implement the use of iTell, a targeted program for  ENL's that is technology based. We will continue to work with a Special Education School Improvement Specialist  (SESIS). Our ELA teachers will use targeted guided reading lessons to work with students at their reading level and  push them to continually improve their reading.   We always need to reinforce and bolster our efforts in engaging Strong Family and Community Ties. We have  purchased a parent contact system, Sonar Cloud, that will allow us to use a digital platform for communications in  2018-19.    5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.

Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   X   N/A   N/A   X               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In terms of our most recent data from the NYS exams. In ELA 30% of our student population is proficient. This is a 10%  increase from 2017. For math, 8% of our population is proficient, this is a 4% increase from the previous year. Data for  the SWD's and ENL's is as follows: on the 2018 State ELA exam, 14% of our SWD were proficient. This is an increase from  4% the previous year. 6% of our ENL's are proficient. This is an increase from 2% the previous year. In math 2.6% of our  students were proficient, this is an increase in 2.6% from the 2017. 1.4% of our ENL's were proficient, this is an increase  of .7% from 2017. These results show an increase, however we are below district and State result. In addition our SWD's  and ENL's continue to struggle.   Middle School 45 received a PPO in 17-18. Positive areas noted included:         "You continue pushing for purposeful adjustments and increasingly more rigorous alignment of the curricula to  the benchmarks of the CCLS, especially in ELA and Math"  "Student work reflects the school-wide movement to promote college and career readiness and higher order  thinking skills through rigorous tasks across disciplines"   Areas for growth included:      "Guide teacher teams in making effective adjustments in instruction"   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          15         " Teachers need to study research based best practices in the use of assessment and feedback"   The 2017-2018 School Survey results state that for rigorous instruction we are .90 below the district average and 1.15  below the city average.   The 16-17 Quality Review (no review in 17-18) rated Middle School 45 Developing for how effective is teaching and  learning?   Middle School 45 uses the Degree of Reading Progress as an initial indicator of our below level readers. Students take  this assessment again at the end of the year. We see that while we are able to move students in their reading level, we  are not able to bring them to grade level as across grades at least 60% are below level in reading.   We need to incorporate more opportunities for Data Driven Instruction especially for our SWD and ENL populations.  This will assist us in providing multiple entry points and allow our struggling learners to participate in all aspects of the  curricula. In addition we will use specific school wide rubrics (Discourse Participation and Engagement) to allow students  to self and peer assess, while deepening our work with rigorous instruction, questioning, engagement and discussion.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019 all ELA teachers with students who are reading below grade level will engage in guided reading  practices resulting in an increase in 3 Fountas and Pinnell levels from September to June 2019.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The School Quality Guide's Framework Score for effective school leadership is 3.44 which was a .67 increase from the  previous year. However we are still below the District average by .09 and the City average by .14   The school survey results show an increase in positive responses for effective school leadership. Our score is a 3.34.  However, we are still scoring below the District and the City in this area.   Our state testing data reveals increase for both ELA and Math. In ELA school wide we had 30.9% proficient, an increase  of 10 points from the previous year. For math we had 8.3% proficient which was an increase of 4 points from the  previous year. On the 2018 State ELA exam, 14% of our SWD were proficient. This is an increase from 4% the previous  year. 6% of our ENL's are proficient. This is an increase from 2% the previous year. In math 2.6% of our students were  proficient, this is an increase in 2.6% from the 2017. 1.4% of our ENL's were proficient, this is an increase of .7% from  2017.  These are modest gains that do not go far enough in helping our students approach proficiency.   Middle School 45 received a PPO visit this year.

"I would also like to thank you for participating in the Data Wise professional learning and implementing rolling  agendas which included minutes and facilitators who led the team meetings."   Needs:   ● According ot the PPO: "Work with teachers to create a bank of sample actionable feedback in each subject area.  Initially, provide teachers with a few samples and let them continue to build on the list so they have a variety of  strategies that can help students improve their work independently."   While overall our scores show progress, we still have work to do in further increasing student proficiency.The systems  we put into place for data analysis and professional development and the monitoring of their effectiveness will help us  to drive these results and student outcomes higher and higher. The key words in the Needs assessment from the PPO  are above are 'across classrooms' and 'inconsistently'. We know that building capacity and ensuring fidelity are  paramount for 2018-2019.

Teachers will be part of an initial  planning conference and will discuss progress on going throughout the year as they move towards effective teaching  practices as detailed in the Danielson Framework   ● Informal and formal observations will be used to maintain a high quality of teaching. Feedback could include:  conduct inter-visitation with other teacher, weekly planning sessions with coach or AP, outside professional  development including that for Special Education and ENL teachers. Teachers in need of these interventions will work  with coach/AP on improvement in area of need for anywhere from 2-6 weeks, re-evaluation of needs will be  conducted at that point   ● Common planning meetings with content and Professional Learning Communities with team devoted to  Professional Development whether within content/grade level grouping with teacher teams or with ENL and Special  Education Teachers.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams meet frequently in concert with school administration to determine the appropriate assessments. This  work includes the use of rubrics as a common assessment tool. Teachers are using the state rubrics for their  assessments. Teachers discuss in Professional Development how to use multiple data sources and assessments to  analyze their plans and determine what else needs to be included in planning so that students attain mastery of the  target standard. Learning Centered Initiative Consultant aided in developing common rubric for classroom discourse,  participation and discussion. Meetings with teacher teams allow teachers to turn key information. Assessment tools  implemented at MS 45 include the benchmarks and common assessments developed in teacher teams. Results from  these assessments are frequently used to plan for teaching, re-teaching or intervention. Assessments were also  looked at with Hess's Matrix to determine if rigorous. Professional Development using DataWise will also assist us to  refine assessments for 2018-2019.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          49      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Middle School 45, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         Middle School 45 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English New Language ENL and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          52      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under applicable sections under ESSA   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Middle School 45, in compliance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent  Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.  Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact  outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic  achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children  achieve State Standards on assessments.

Students will be heterogenously grouped to allow for much student to student  discussion, interaction and peer feedback.  There will be small group targeted instruction based  on the specific skills in which students need additional support and  to enhance their success rate  on the NYSESLAT exam.  Before school, 1 group of 12 students with an ESL licensed teacher  will meet Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7:15 - 8:15 and afterschool, 4 groups, 3 ESL licensed  and 1 content (science) licensed teachers,  will meet Wednesdays and Thursdays 3:20-4:20,  beginning in late November and continuing through May.  Groups will be flexible based on  emerging student's needs as determined by progress monitoring.  The ESL teachers will co-plan  and co-teach with the science teacher.  On days when trips are planned, the program will meet  until 5:20.  The program will consist of reading/writing via a Project Based Learning approach  (PBL).  The PBL approach consists of thematic planning which includes trips, projects, reading,  writing, research in an effort to enhance language acquisition.  The trips are based on the  teachers theme.  Some trips are to the Arthur Avenue neighborhood to learn about  cultures/shopping/food, while another is to the Bronx Zoo to discuss animals, habitats,  etc.  Metro cards and train passes will need to be purchased for the trips.  We hope to have  parents join us on the trips as well.   In addition, the use of the Imagine Learning Program  will  be used online with students and address individual needs in reading.  This program will be  used with the ELL students in this program before/after school.   This program can also be used  by students on home computers which will allow for parents to be involved as well. In addition,  the students will have the opportunity to utilize a new program MYON.  This is an online library,  which will allow students to read both fiction & non-fiction on a variety of topics at their reading  level.  Students will also be using NYSESLAT practice materials to enhance their success rate on  the NYSESLAT exam.

It includes both internal  structures for the sharing of resources and information, as well as external supports.     Network: Our network provides professional development for ESL teachers/supervisors on a  monthly basis.  Our ESL coordinator attends the sessions and turnkeys the information to the  ESL teachers.  Topics are decided by the Network and include: Using the AMAO Tool to  Determine Student Need and Plan Instruction, Specific Instructional Strategies, the NYS New &  Home Language Progressions, Designing Common Core Aligned Instruction for ELLs,  Incorporating Technology into the ELL classroom, and Translanguaging.  These sessions are  then turnkeyed to the ESL department by the attending individuals on the first Monday/Tuesday  PD block of each month.  The schedule of CFN ELL workshops this school year is: October 1st,  December 17, February 13, March 25, April 24, and June 5.     ELL Consultant: Liz Irwin, a former AUSSIE consultant will be contracted for 5 days to provide  modeling, coaching, and feedback to teachers of ELLs.  The teachers who receive direct PD will  then open their classrooms as labsites for model ESL instruction.  All teachers of ELLs in the  school will have the opportunity to visit the labsites and observe best practices.     Fordham University Regional Bilingual/ESL Resource Network (R-BERN):  In addition, ESL teachers attend workshops facilitated by R-BERN at Fordham  University.  Dates and agendas are sent via email to me prior to the meeting date.   Again, the  info is shared with the ESL department during Monday PD time and/or Tuesday PD time as  mandated by the new contract.  On the first Monday/Tuesday of each month, the ESL teachers  meet as a study group to share materials and turnkey any trainings they attended in the previous  month.  Topics already address this year include: October: Language Acquistion Strategies-CFN  109 Monthly ELL PD, November: ELL Strategies to Meet Common Core with Fordham  University R-BERN, December: DELLSS Art Instruction for ELLs.     Project Based Learning:  Furthermore, the ESL teachers for the beginner ESL students worked with Ms. Colon from  RBERN in the 2013-2014 to create PBL lessons.  The teachers of our intermediate/advanced  students work with the ELA department to differentiate instruction for all ESL students via the  Expeditionary Learning curriculum.  This work has continued in the 2014-15 school year.     A study group including teachers of beginning level ELLs working in the Title III Direct  Instruction Program (but open to other teachers of ELLs as well) will use The ESL/ELL  Teachers Survival Guide, by Larry Ferlazzo as a guiding text. The study group meets of the  second Tuesday of every month. Teachers will use the text to drive discussions around best  practices for accelerating language acquisition as well as increasing content area knowledge for  this population.

This workshop was held at 10 AM on a Tuesday morning in October.        College Campus Visits for Parents of ELLs:  Fordham University, Hunter College, Lehman College, Bronx Community College: Scheduled  for Spring 2015 (March-May)   Our ELL parents will visit colleges with our parent coordinator to develop an understanding of  college readiness as promoted by our school chancellor.  We have tentatively planned to allow a  limited number of students to accompany their parents on these trips for the first time in the  Spring of 2015.     Parent & Student Book Club: We will launch a joint family literacy initiative, during which  parents and students will engage in a book club, reading the same text in both English &  Spanish.  This club will meet during 6th period lunch periods on Tuesdays, beginning in  February.  Texts will be jointly chosen by students, parents, and teachers.  We hope to promote  literacy in both English and Spanish through this program, provide time for adolescents to bond  with their parents around engaging texts.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          60   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Language Arts teachers conduct running record assessments for new admits, as well as all students (including ELLs) considered  below grade level on the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) conducted in September.  Teachers use TCRWP for their running  record assessments at least three times a year, in order to determine an instructional reading level for their students and to  help guide students in choosing texts for their independent reading.  Most ELLs score "at risk" for their grade level and Former  ELLs score "below grade level."  Within their PLCs, teachers also adjust and create unit assessments to use within the units of  study.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63         The assistant principal who supervises ELA, ENL, and our new Bilingual TBE program organizes and distributes assessments  and/or scaffolded benchmarks.  She also asks for, reviews, and maintains records of student performance on these  assessments throughout the school year.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the program depends upon benchmarks, revision and reflection of lesson plans, looking at student work as well  as performance on the NYSESLAT simulation vs. the state NYSESLAT exam.  During the ENL PLC, teachers engage in a "Looking  at Student Work" protocol that has them analyze student work (benchmarks or other assessments/assignments) in both the  Entering/Emerging  groups and the Transitioning/Emerging groups so that these teachers can make curriculum adjustments,  activities, and/or scaffolds.  Writing is an example of an area of need in the past where teachers have created additional  assessments and instructional activities that ultimately resulted in progress for most students on the NYSESLAT.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers engage in a weekly Professional Learning Community (centered around content area) that allows time for teachers to  share and analyze data, discuss or research appropriate interventions, set goals, and put a plan into place to meet goals.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers can identify and submit names of at-risk ELLs to their supervisor for "Kid Talk."  This takes place on a monthly basis  for a specific student.  One teacher presents by informing a group of teachers of the student's background, work samples, data  and areas of concern.  The group asks questions and brainstorms goals and interventions for the student.  The plan is copied  and provided to all relevant teachers and support staff.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Across the grades, most students who come in to the school system with little or no English language (scores of 0-14 on the  NYSITELL) score Entering or Emerging on the NYSESLAT by the end of the school year. At least two of these same students  scored Transitioning in Spring 2017.  Across the grades, the majority of our students scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT.  Most  ELLs scored level 1 on the ELA 2017; a small number scored a 2.  The same for Math scores.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers engage in a weekly Professional Learning Community (centered around content area) that allows time for teachers to  share and analyze data, discuss or research appropriate interventions, set goals, and put a plan into place to meet goals.  This  information is communicated to supervisors who approve changes or adjustments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All classes travel as a group.  Newly admitted students and Newcomers scoring Entering or Emerging on the prior  year's NYSESLAT are placed in one of two classes.  One class has 6th graders, the other class has 7th and 8th graders.  Newcomers and students scoring Transitioning, Expanding, or Commanding on the prior year's NYSESLAT are placed   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64         in a graded, heterogeneous class.  Students who are former ELLs may be placed together in an additional graded,  heterogeneous class with non-ELLs.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     All classes travel as a group.  Students who are in sixth grade, whose home language is Spanish, and whose parents  elected a bilingual program are placed in a TBE class.  Students who meet these criteria can range in NYSESLAT level  from Entering to Expanding.  c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our TBE program (that will open in Fall 2018) would have students at the Entering & Emerging levels.  This means 180  instructional minutes of HLA in Spanish is delivered to students and the content area of Science will be provided in Spanish by  a teacher certified in bilingual education.  This group would also receive Mathematics instruction in Spanish.  In both the ENL and TBE programs, students who are new admits, or scoring Entering or Emerging, are in a class that is taught  360 minutes of ENL and 90 minutes per week of ENL Integrated with ELA with a dually teacher certified in ESOL and ELA.  In  addition, these students receive 225 minutes of ENL integrated into Social Studies from a certified ESOL instructor that use ENL  methodologies.  In the ENL program, students scoring Transitioning or Expanding on the prior year's NYSESLAT receive 225  minutes of ENL and  225 minutes of ELA per week with a dually teacher certified in ESOL and ELA. These classes follow the same curriculum as non- ELL students in the school, but teachers provide supports using ENL strategies and methodologies. In addition, these students  receive 225 minutes of Integrated ENL during Social Studies instruction from a certified ESOL instructor that uses ENL  methodologies.    Former ELLs (students scoring Commanding on the prior year's NYSESLAT) are supported 90 minutes per week by a certified  ESOL teacher integrated into their Social Studies or ELA class (co-teaching).     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Teachers use ENL methodologies such as explicit vocabulary instruction and reinforcement, providing speaking or writing  frames, providing visuals to aid in comprehension, and designing learning opportunities in all four modalities (listening,  speaking, reading, and writing) in order to scaffold tasks, activities, and projects in core subjects that meet many of the  Common Core Learning Standards.  School-wide, and inclusive of ELLs, teachers use a variety of research-based Engagement  Structures where students frequently have opportunities to listen, speak, read and write in their new language and interact  with core content.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In our free-standing ENL program, home language is used as a support for comprehension or as a resource for English word- attack strategies.  Our TBE program in Spanish will use teacher-created benchmarks to evaluate those students throughout the year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students engage in a Project-Based curriculum that is cross-curricular and integrates many of the topics addressed in  the SIFE Bridges Curriculum. Students must work collaboratively to present a visual or audio-visual product, which develops   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65      students’ social, academic, and language needs.  b. Newcomers scoring Entering or Emerging, are in a class that is also mostly project-based with frequent  presentations.  Projects are thematic and usually begin with explicit vocabulary instruction and include a variety of  opportunities for Listening and Speaking about the content.  Students are exposed to text excerpts, topics, and themes in the  regular curriculum associated with their grade.  Students also read and analyze and eventually write about Nonfiction and  Fiction texts that relate to a theme and include visual supports to aid comprehension. Students have access to translators.  c. Developing ELLs receive supports such as teacher-modeled think alouds, explicit vocabulary instruction, accompanying  visuals, scaffolded steps and writing frames, while learning the same curriculum as non-ELLs.  d. Long Term ELLs receive supports such as those for Developing ELLs while learning the same curriculum as non-ELLs.  Long  Term ELLs with learning disabilities are provided additional supports as determed in their IEPs.  e. Former ELLs are given language supports during Integrated ENL in a Science or Social Studies class in a small group with an  ENL teacher for 90 minutes for two years after exiting ELL status.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers scaffold, break content material into manageable parts, and also use a variety of research-based Engagement  Structures where students frequently have opportunities to listen, speak, read and write in the English language and interact  with core content.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use the same grade-level materials as teachers of non-ELLs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs have both an ESOL certified teacher, as well as a teacher certified in teaching students with disabilities.  With some  classes the ESOL teacher pushes in to provide language support, with ICT classes these teachers co-teach.  These teams of  teachers meet and plan instructional activities and curricular supports that help ELL-SWDs both increase English proficiency  and achieve their IEP goals.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Entering and Emerging ELLs who will take the ELA exam are invited to a Title 3 before or after school program to give them  extra support and strategies to prepare them for exams.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      ENL Students will use MyOn, a web-based library for listening and reading 90 minutes per week, in addition to regurlarly  scheduled weekly individualized Reading and Mathematics instruction using iReady.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Like all students, ELLs are invited to Title 3 after-school programs that teachers provide based on students' needs or interests.  Teachers identify ELL students that can benefit from additional academic practice after-school, and reach out to parents to  gauge interest in placing them in a program.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ENL teachers have a class set of iPads that students use to research, to develop and create audio-visual projects, use  interactive applications in Mathematics, or to complete listening activities.  Students also engage in interactive lessons during  ENL, Social Studies, and Mathematics using these iPads.  Our TBE program has a class set of laptops to utilize in developing literacy in English and in Spanish.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Entering and Emerging ENL students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and access to translators.  Teachers encourage  students to try and ween themselves off dependency of a translator.  Teachers also translate written directions when  launching a new and unfamiliar activity.  ENL students of higher proficiency are encouraged to use their home language as a  resource (such as when encountering new words) and teachers help students make connections to their language or culture.  TBE students are instructed and assessed in Spanish in their HLA, Science, and Mathematics classes.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Teachers of ENL students are consulted when the principal makes decisions about providing services or purchasing resources.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ENL teachers have a class set of iPads that students use to research, to develop and create audio-visual projects, or to  complete listening activities.  Students also engage in interactive lessons during ENL and Social Studies using these iPads.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to an orientation meeting before school starts.  ELLs who enrolled throughout the school year  are placed in a class where teachers guide and orient them with different activities throughout the year.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not applicable.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Teachers of ELLs have formed a Professional Learning Community with the goals of adjusting curriculum through the planning  of projects, researching and sharing ENL strategies and methodologies, and increasing academic performance of ELLs on  English Language and Mathematics standardized tests.  Teachers in this group teach a variety of content areas and meet on  Thursdays for 45 minutes every week.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Middle School 45                                                                              School DBN: 10X045  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
