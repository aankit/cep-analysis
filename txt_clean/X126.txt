The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The vision of P.S. 126X and our community is to teach our children of diverse backgrounds to read, write, think,  problem solve, speak well, appreciate the arts and behave in socially acceptable ways in order to become  independent contributing members of society. We aim to provide an Environment that is Engaging and provides  multiple Opportunities for students to learn (EEO).      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 126X is a Pre-K through 5 elementary school located in the Highbridge section of the Bronx. The Highbridge  community advocates excellence in education, the advancement of youth, promotes adult education and celebrates  the diversity of its members.   P.S. 126X is structured into two major components - Early Childhood Pre-K thru 2 and Upper Grades 3-5. This  structure under the supervision of upper and lower grade assistant principals will enable teachers, administrators,  support teams and parents to address the educational needs of our students according to their developmental stages,  academic ranges, and specified individual needs. This structure provides optimal time for data-driven instructional  planning in an effort to ensure intellectual and social growth at appropriate levels for all of our students. This is a  transitional community with a significant percentage of families in temporary housing and children in foster care;  therefore, we have strong ties to community-based organizations such as Woodycrest, Highbridge Life and Bridge  Builders. A school-based health center, the Morris Heights Clinic supports the health care needs of our students here  at P.S. 126X.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The success of teacher team collaboration can be attributed to time allocated for self-reflection and refinement,  specifically through teacher teams which include grade teams, ELA and Math Curriculum Team, Spirit Team and the  Technology Team. As a result of the work of collaborative teacher teams, we have strengthened our common set of  beliefs of how children learn best (environment, engagement and opportunity). Through consistent professional  development and teacher team meetings a deeper understanding of Danielson’s Framework is evident. We  acknowledge and celebrate the various levels of expertise amongst staff.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46         intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 126X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 126X will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The After school Program  will primarily address the needs of students who raw score for the writing part of the  NYSESLAT was below 8.  Currently, we have 69 students that meet this criteria. The program  components will include 30 minutes of reading, 30 minutes of speaking and listening, 30 minutes  of writing, followed by 30 minutes of STEM.  The language of instruction will be the second  language (English).   These components will improve the writing of our ELL learners.  Students  will be provided with different tools to scaffold their writing such as, sight-words cards, picture  dictionaries, adjective and adverb charts, the use of basic idiomatic expressions and the use of  various graphic organizer. We will develop a unit of studies for Science. The science focus for  second and third grade will be "Plants and Animal Diversity".  The science focus for fourth and  fifth grade will be the "Interactions of Air, Water, and Land".  In addition, to supporting the  fourth grade students with the writing component of the NYSESLAT, we will also  prepare for  the NYS science test.   There will be one bilingual licensed teacher, one ESL licensed teacher,  and one technology teacher that will provide instruction.   We will be using a series of resources to achieve our goals. The first resource  is i-Ready. I- Ready is an online program that we will be using for the reading component of the  program.  This program will be at no cost to the school.  The second online program we will be  using is Reading A-Z.  Reading A-Z  is a reading, vocabulary, and content area resource.  It also  provides a listening and speaking component.  It will equip teachers with discussion questions  along with short response questions to address the writing.  This program also provides books in  Spanish for students to practice at home reading in their native language.  Title III funds will be  use to buy the licence for the Reading A-Z online program.  The science and technology part of  the program will also use the STEM material we got from the summer program to connect the  unit of studies.   For the second and third grade we will use the STEM unit "The Best of  Bugs:  Designing Hand Pollinators". For the fourth and fifth grade, we will use  "A stick in the  Mud: Evaluating a Landscape".  This program will also  be at no cost to the school.  We will  spend Title III funds to replenish the hands on materials for the stem kits.   The After school Program will operate for 36 sessions, beginning 12/19/18 through  4/24/19.  Each session will last 2 hours on consecutive Wednesdays and Thursdays of each  week, from 2:30 to 4:30.  Parents will be notified through a letter that will be written in both  languages English and Spanish.   An attendance sheet will be provided for every teacher teaching  the After School Program.  At the end of the month the attendance will be collected and placed  on the Title III binder in the section label attendance.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                   Rationale:    The professional development activities at PS 126 will equip teachers with instructional  strategies to meet the needs of ELL Students.  As a result,  teachers will put into practice these  strategies in the classroom resulting in student achievement.  The Professional Development will  focus in strategies that will support the development of writing.  Taking into account, writing  development of English Language Learners is connected to reading, listening, and  speaking.  Since, we want our ELL students to be prepare for the 21st century we will  incorporate STEM and technology as part of the  professional development.    Teachers to receive training:    We will offer professional development for ESL certified teachers, bilingual teachers, and  teachers non ESL certified teachers that work with ELLs.  Non certified ESL teachers are currently a part of a series of five workshops provided by  the BFSC.   These workshops are designed to provide teachers with tools to giving ELLs access  to grade level curriculum.  These workshops are provided at no additional cost.  However,  we  will use Title III funds to pay for substitute teachers for these classrooms.  The teachers are  responsible for sharing this information with the rest of the teachers.    Bilingual teachers will be a part of the 2nd cohort that attends the workshops.  These workshops  are free however, we will use the Title III funds to pay for substitute teachers in these  classrooms.

We recognize the critical role parents can and should play in their  children's education.  We also believe that we should  empower parents with the tools to help  their children at home.    Schedule and duration:  There will be five workshops for the parents of English Language Learners.  The workshops are  intended to address the needs across grades 2-5.   The workshops will take place during after  school, from 2:30pm to 4:30pm.  Notifications of the program will be send to parents in English  and Spanish.  The translation services in Spanish will be provided by Ms. Garcia, Bilingual  Teacher.    Topics to be covered:  December: The first workshop will be "Supporting My Child Learning through the use of  technology".  During this section, parents will learn how to use the i-Ready program for math  and ELA.  Parents will also learn how to access Reading A-Z, which is an educational  website.   Reading A-Z allows students to  have access to a variety of leveled books.  In addition,  parents  will have access to books in English and Spanish.    January: The second workshop will be "Helping my Kids with "Estrellitas".  In this workshop,  parents will be provided with materials from the" Estrellita" program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The school  uses various assessment tools to assess early literacy skills of ELLs.  For reading,  Fountas & Pinnell  running  records, piece of the week writing samples,  benchmark assessments and formative assessments and the cumulative end of  unit assessment (summative).      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have gained useful insight regarding the adjustment of our teaching practices, for example, implementation of guided  reading for first grade.

We have also incorporated a shared rading period in which students learn  new vocabulary, teachers demonstrate good reading behavior, and making inferences.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Student outcomes on summative and formative assessments are used primarily to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.  Student progress is assessed in various ways.  The school analyzes movement from one level to the next on the NYS Test in  Math, ELA, and Science.  We also analyze the movement of students within the modalities on the NYSESLAT Test.  Data from  the NYC Progress Report, teacher effectiveness tools are also used to evaluate student performance.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After the data have been analyzed, teachers will use that data to make small group instructions to address misconceptions and  differentiate instruction.  Also we have an RTI teacher that  works with students that are at risk of not making progress.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   After looking at the data we have incorporated different initiatives like the Fundations program for students who need  fundational skill in reading.  We are also using the LLI and Great Leaps program for the RTI program.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    Based on the data derived from the Spring 2016 NYS assessments including the NYS tests in ELA, Math and NYSLESLAT, ELL  students are performing as follows:    In  Kindergarten- 16 students are beginners, 3 students are low intermediate, 9 students are high intermediate, 9 students are  advanced, and 14 students are Commanding proficient.   Based on these results, students will continue to get additional  support in reading and fundational skills.  In Grade 1 the majority of our students are in expanding advanced level.  Based on these results, we will provide vocabulary  instruction and reading comprehension.  In Grade 2- 1 student is beginner, 3 students are low intermediate, 1 student is high intermediate, 9 students are expanding  advanced, and 2 students are commanding proficient.  Based on thee results, fundational skills for the beginners and  intermediate and vocabulary and comprehension skills for the expanding advance.  In Grade 3 the majority of our students are in expanding advanced level.

What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Grade Team meetings, block schedule, Monday Professional development, Teacher Tuesday sessions.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The first tier of grouping is by grade.  Secondly using the data from baseline assessments, teacher observations, and  assessed level of language acquisition students are grouped according to their specific language needs.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Students in TBE are grouped heterogeneously in each class. Instructions is scaffolded in ELA and math to support the  various needs and levels of language proficiency of each individual child.  Based on part 154 the mandated number of  minutes in native language instructions is addressed by a native language instructional program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:  N/A       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              P.S. 126 is designed around the principle that education is personalized.   Each student’s learning plan grows out of his or  her unique needs and interests. There are 2 organizational models at P.S. 126X.  Bilingual (TBE) classes are self-contain.  Students in bilingual classes are grouped heterogeneously in each class.  Differentiation of instruction provides the necessary  small group and/or individualized instruction.  The quantity of native language arts instruction provided is based the mandated  units of study according to the LAP.   Additional support will be  provided during  the Afterschool and Saturday Literacy and  Math Lab. The workshop model for teaching is implemented by the classroom teacher following balanced literacy and  balanced math approach to teaching. Instructional program is aligned with CCLS for reading, writing and mathematics.       An ESL Pull-Out model is used to service students in grades K, 1, 2, , 3, and 4, 5 grade special education. Students are pulled  out during the daily 50 minute period for content area (social studies, science or math) instruction using ESL  methodologies.  The instruction is aligned with classroom instruction, NYC Scope and Sequence, and Common Core Learning  Standards.                Using the  push-in model the licensed ESL teacher works with small groups of students  in grade K, 1 and 2 and special  education supporting classroom teachers using ESL methodologies.              Based on the Language Allocation policy, teacher schedules are adjusted to meet the needs as prescribed in the  policy.  PS 126X also has a Native Language Arts program to fulfill the remaining time requirements of the LAP. The Native  Language Arts programs is aligned to the schoolwide ELA reading and writing curriculum, and services all grades (K-5) at least  90 minutes per week covered by a Native Language Arts teacher.  The remaining minutes are covered through the  content areas- science, social studies, and math.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the the TBE program, students in grades 2, 3 and 4 receive 1 period of instruction in science in their native language. ESL  methodologies are implemented in Social Studies and Science content areas in alignment with the common core curriculum  and the Scope and Sequence pacing guides.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The Native Language Arts program administers formative assessments  (teacher created) within the units of study in reading,  writing, math, and the content areas.  Benchmark assessments are also adminiistered.  We also administered the periodic  assessment for ELLs.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Transitional bilingual program or the freestanding ESL services, the school offers both after-school enrichment programs for  these ELL students. PSX 126 currently has no  SIFE students.  Newly Proficient  Newly Proficient students on the NYSESLAT receive extension of time on state tests and it is under the discretion of the  teacher to afford them extended time to accommodate them during unit and teacher made tests.  Children are also offered  opportunities to attend  After school and Saturday Literacy and Math Labs.  Teachers are aware of students transition into  monolingual classes and therefore are grouped accordingly. They are encouraged to participate in extra-curricular  activities.  All school programs and activites are open to all students and letters to parents are distributed in both  languages.  Newly proficient ELLs are placed in ESL self-contained classrooms and are supported with the strategies for  enhancing language acquisitions.  Newcomers  PS 126 provides several services to newcomers beyond the regular transitional bilingual program and ESL  services.  For example, the After school Enrichment Program three times per week provides the grades 2-5 transitional  bilingual program students Guided Reading instruction. Instructional support for newcomers also includes differentiated  instruction, small group activities provided by Bilingual and ESL teachers in the classroom. Strategies are provided for students  of varied proficiency levels, modifying instruction for every lesson taught.     Long-term ELLs and ELLs with 4-6 years                Each year the school requests extension of services for the Long-term ELLs. The school will mandate these students  participation in after school and extended day programs through after-school programs. In addition, the teachers of the  freestanding ESL program work with the classroom teachers to identify students’ need for supplementary reading and math  instruction.                In the bilingual program the teachers make increasing English language instruction a priority, without compromising  literacy in the native language, therefore creating bi-literate students. PS 126 currently has no long term ELLS.  The majority of the students are in push-in/pull-out model program in grades K - 2  and the remaining students receive ESL  instruction from the ESL cluster teacher.   Students are provided with instruction that focuses on the use of all four language  modalities (Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing) and they are grouped based on their performance on the NYSESLAT, with  specific attention being paid to the students’ individual raw scores in each modality. Differentiation occurs through the use of  scaffolding techniques, questioning techniques, Accountable Talk, and tiered activities/ differentiated tasks.               Classroom teachers uses Smart Boards, Elmos and with all students including ELLs.

Every classroom has desk top computers for  student use.               Our plan for ELLS identified as having special needs is designed to adapt the curriculum to students needs by providing  professional development to licensed bilingual, ESL and CTT teachers in order to modify lessons to meet the individual styles  and needs of students on the goals written in their IEPs.  In addition the certified special education teachers collaborate with  ESL, special ed, and bilingual teachers to address the specific needs of each ELL.  These teachers work together to individually  plan for academic development and linguistic growth of these students.  Mandated service providers support ELLS with IEPS in  speech, occupational therapy, and SETTS services.  We have in place a system that closely examines teacher referrals of ELLs to  special education taking into consideration the understanding that language acquisition is not an indicator of special needs.                 All teachers supporting ELLs hold the appropriate licenses.  Students are also supported by related service providers  who are also licensed in bilingual education and/or speak the language of the majority of the ELLs, psychologists, guidance  counselors, social workers and speech teachers, paraprofessionals, the health providers, the librarians, and  literacy coach.     An after school program  is in place to provide support for those ELLs on all levels students and students who will be taking  the NYS Test in E.L.A. and Math for the first time in 2016. The program is also is structured according to students grade  level.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school is aware of the need for careful planning of services for Students with Interrupted Formal Education. The goal of  the  program for support of SIFE is to focus on the development of both the academic and linguistic skills of SIFE. In addition to  the transitional bilingual program or the freestanding ESL services, the school offers both after-school enrichment programs  for these ELL students. PSX 126 currently has 0 SIFE students.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 126X                                                                              School DBN: 09x126  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
