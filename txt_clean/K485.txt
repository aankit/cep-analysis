This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      At the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology we adhere to a few core values: our students will be  pushed to continually challenge themselves; all members of our community will work collaboratively to model and to  be accountable for fostering genuine respect, confidence, and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge; we are lifelong  learners who build communities and encourage others to be their personal best; our work is to prepare students to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      be curious, independent learners and critical thinkers who question and investigate so that they are equipped to  address both local and global challenges; and to be kind, be kind, be kind.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    These principles guide us to work together to create a school that will help our diverse community grow into adults  who care about their world. The HSTAT magic is in our regular reflection and commitment to adjusting what we do to  meet the needs of our young people by consistently searching for new ways to become a better school. Our culture of  self-reflection has led us to strengthen and further develop our programs and academic and emotional student  support systems. Our 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade teacher teams collaborate to promote the academic and social  growth of all students through rigorously developed coursework and high expectations. Early intervention programs  for our incoming 9th grade ensure that each of our students start high school sure of foot. Through the work of an  extraordinary staff and peer to peer support, we differentiate for our diverse population by meeting our students’  individual needs, and focusing on college access for all. We support students on the road to college and beyond by  addressing the needs of the whole child: an unbeatable teaching, guidance, and administrative team; dedicated  support staff; committed families; two College Advisors; staff assigned to grade-level Academic Advisement; exciting  academic programs; an array of extracurricular activities; senior mentors; and a community ethic promote the success  of our many initiatives. At Tele, we all do our part to enrich our students’ lives.    Our school began its life as the Bay Ridge High School for Girls in 1915. In 1985, after 70 years as the pre eminent high  school for young women in Brooklyn, we became a coeducational school and our name changed to the High School of  Telecommunication Arts and Technology. We are proud of our long history-- our history, institutional knowledge, and  steady foundation give us the freedom and flexibility to be creative, and to continue to build.   HSTAT has been fortunate to have partnered with several organizations to continue to grow and meet the needs of  our diverse population. We are among a small group of New York City schools to pilot the Software Engineering  Program (SEP) and have worked hard to develop a four-year program that will develop students' programming and  problem-solving skills. We have also collaborated with New York University to develop a Nest program to serve the  needs of students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The Charles Hayden Foundation supports us to provide  early access to college for our students, to offer an SAT class, and in the development of an intervention program for  students in the lowest third city-wide.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our Nest program serves students who have ASD. This program is staffed by teachers trained to work with students  who are autistic. These classes must also be capped at 25 (including no more than 6 students with IEPs). All students  in the program receive speech (SDI) services, counseling services, and occupational therapy.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction: We have been focusing on and we will continue to focus on using big ideas and questions to  drive instruction. Over time, we have considered the question of complexity by looking at texts, the lesson plan, and  the unit. This year, we look at the course. The goal is to design instruction so that students continue to develop and  deepen their understanding. We are working on re evaluating our courses for cultural relevancy.       Collaborative School Culture: Grade Teams, led by Grade Team Leads (teachers) work to align curricula across  disciplines using the skills that students most need to develop beginning with a grade level performance task given at   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      the start of year and using grade level formative assessments throughout the year. Grade Teams analyze student  work to identify CCLS skills (as described in HSTAT's Common Core Learning Standards Skills handbook) they should  focus instruction.       Trust and Supportive Environment: We spend the first week of school giving orientation lessons designed to help  students to be successful throughout the year. These lessons include College Prep Day (lessons on Paying for College,  Researching Colleges, Majors and Careers in Science), Executive Functions (lessons on Organization, Goal Setting,  Communication), understanding our School Expectations and Grading Policy, and Managing Technology (lessons on  Responsibly Using Social Media, Digital Footprint). We also conduct trips and events for particular grade-teams, like  the Ninth Grade Field Day, Grade-Level College Trips, Tenth Grade Symposium and Eleventh Grade Philadelphia trip.  We also offer a Mentoring Program for our struggling ninth and 10th grade students, so that those students have an  adult to go to for help and support. Each cohort of students is assigned an Academic Advisor as well as a guidance  counselor. Further, we have put into place a systemic plan for closing the achievement gap for which include many of  the initiatives listed above.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K485   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1278   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.           We determined our focus should be in Domain 3 of the Danielson rubric, including "Engaging Students in   Learning", "Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques," and "Using Assessment in Instruction." As a  school, we have developed a multi-year professional development plan to make instruction more rigorous. In  year one, we focused on Text Complexity, developing and implementing reading strategies to help students  access more complex texts. In year two, we met in departments to develop exemplary lessons in each  discipline, studying those lessons from the various lenses provided by the Danielson Framework, with  particular stress on Questioning and Discussion Techniques (3b) and Engaging Students in Learning (3c). Last  year, year three, we continued this work by revising our units of study to ensure that units point to big ideas  that are engaging and rewarding. In year four, we will focus on revising the course so that individual units of  study are sequenced and aligned so that students will return to overarching questions and themes. This year  we build on our work re-imagining the course by including explicitly incorporating culturally relevant and  responsive perspectives. We also continue to incorporate a universal method of writing instruction, based on  Judith Hochman's Writing Revolution.     Our school's strengths continue to be our process of reflection and revision based on student work, teacher   practice, and evolving global standards.     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June of 2019, all courses will have been revised to include a portfolio-like project that underscores our philosophy of  learning being on a continuum. All courses will also have been revised to include a more explicit response to cultures  and communities outside a euro-centric perspective. These revisions will result in at least a 10% increase in students'  positive responses that they "feel challenged in their classes" on the NYC School Survey.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Use student-generated questions about the course to revise the  way we cover topics. Use Judith Hochman's Writing Revolution  to develop and implement a writing instruction model across all  grade levels and in all disciplines.    All teachers   September –  October  2018   Use last year's focus on re-evaluating the course to inform the  development of a course-long project that is culturally relevant  and responsive. Departments will evaluate the strength of the  courses based on an examination of the course through the lens  of the Danielson rubric and through inter-visitation and formal  and informal observations. We will focus on backward planning  and thinking about how the big ideas should drive all instruction.    All teachers  At monthly   meetings  September –  June 2019   Make sample courses a part of the January 2019 PTA  presentation that covers Advanced Placement and College Now  offerings, Regents requirements and Common Core instructional  shifts.

This will result in a 10% increase in  teachers' positive response to question 11e on the NYC School Survey, "...[T]he principal sets clear expectations for  teachers about implementing what they have learned in professional development." Furthermore, since professional  development is tied to developing engaging and thought-provoking questions and projects, this initiative will result in an  increase in students' responses to question 5a on the NYC School Survey, "In how many of your classes are you  challenged?"      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our Professional Development (PD) program comes in three forms: Staff-proposed PD, Department Meetings, and  Grade-Level meetings. In each, the administration and staff provides our teachers with PD based on the needs of our  students and teachers.    In our Staff-Proposed PD, teachers have the opportunity to complete a Google form in which they name a topic (a  pedagogical approach, a new piece of technology, a new approach to their discipline) that they'd like to learn about,  and they or a colleague will offer to lead a workshop in a topic. On Staff-led PD days, all staff are invited to attend one  of three or four different workshops. The materials from these workshops is archived on our intranet site for teachers'  future reference.    Assistant Principals also lead their departments in PD on the Danielson rubric, particularly in the area of need as  determined through analysis of the MOTP in Advance. For 2018-2019 school year, our focus will be on 3C, "Engaging  Students in Learning," with a focus on rigorous and challenging content, the differentiation required to provide all  students access to that content, and on the new and different approaches to instruction that would make that  content engaging and meaningful to our students. Assistant Principals lead monthly workshops to re-evaluate the  rigor of courses.    All teachers are part of a Grade Team, and Grade Team Leads onsultation with the principal, lead their grade teams in  an analysis of student work. From that analysis, grade teams determine the skill-based focus of instruction for the  entire grade-level, across disciplines.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       HSTAT Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)   Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.         HSTAT will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● Contacting parents six times per year (in addition to report cards) regarding academic progress to help parents  work with their children to improve their level of achievement.    ● Offering workshops designed to provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become  involved in planning and decision making in support of the education of their children;   ● Continuing to use Pupilpath as our parent portal and updating our school website, HSTAT.org.   fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● Offering workshops to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;      HSTAT's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● insure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In June 2018,  39 ELLs and FELLs took the Global History Regents and 18 students scored below a 65 and 41  ELLs and FELLs took the Living Environment Regents and 28 students scored below a 65. Our  subgroups are 10th-12th grade FELLs and ELLS who have not passed Global History or Living  Environment. Our meeting days are Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 3-4pm, from September 25th  until June 1; a total of 56 meetings. We employ one full-time licensed ESL teacher, one ELA and  one Science teacher. Instruction is in English. We have bilingual dictionaries and glossaries as  well as copies of previous Regents exams in Spanish and Chinese. Teachers in the Title 3  program regularly meet with content teachers to reinforce materials being used in class. Students  use both review books and textbooks currently used by content teachers. During tutoring  sessions, students take regents exams from previous years as diagnostics and the content and  ESL teacher review the results and plan tutoring session that target what the students need to  review. Parents were notified in their language of choice of the tutoring program. Letters were  sent home with students.

Teachers in the Title III program work along with all of our teachers in grade team meetings in  inquiry work where student work is shared, areas of need are identified, and best practices for  serving ELLs are shared. Our ELL and FELL teachers meet once monthly with grade teams to  discuss individual ELLs and FELLs progress.  Teachers in the Title III program will lead  professional development sessions in October, January and March 2019 to share best practices  with the staff. Our ELL teacher will attend an ENL Coordinator’s Working Group for three  sessions on 12/6, 3/14, and 6/11 to discuss how to implement further structures to support ELLs.  Our ELL and FELL teachers will attend the UFT Conference on Effective Instruction for English  Language Learners on October 20, 2018. Our ENL teacher/coordinator and ELL guidance  counselor are attending the CCER series at NYU on dismantling racism and developing   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43            Part C: Professional Development   culturally responsive pedagogy for diverse learners on 10/17, 12/5, 1/2, 1/30, 3/6, 4/10 and  5/8.  In addition to inside our school, teachers in the Title III program, as well as the majority of  teachers in our building, have been trained in the Hochman Method of Reading and Writing  Instruction, a four session training on strengthening the reading and writing skills for struggling  readers and writers.     Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Working with  both our PTA, parent-coordinator, college advisors, bilingual grade advisor and ENL teacher, we  have scheduled three meetings to be held over the school year. In October, we have scheduled a  workshop on applying to college for both documented and undocumented students. In December,  we've scheduled a workshop on how to complete the FAFSA. For February we've scheduled a  workshop on school-wide academic and behavioral expectations. Each workshop will be from 6- 8pm and parents will be notified by letter. Agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parents'  preferred languages will be kept by the parent coordinator.    Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses teacher created assessments.  All entering 9th graders are given a literacy assessment which includes a  reading and writing component. Our ENL teacher assesses incoming ELLs using a modified version of this assessment.  Our ENL  teacher regularly uses formative assessments to provide insight into student progress and identify areas of need for each  student. Results of such assessments are shared at grade team meetings so that all content teachers can use the data to  inform their instructional planning.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our ENL teacher meets regularly with grade teams and content teachers during 80 minutes of mandated professional  development to discuss results of formative assessments and plan targeted intervention.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELLs by analyzing the New York City ELA Performance tasks to gather baseline data for each  student and then we administer it again to identify progress and areas of need.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?     All teachers in our school meet as a grade team for 80 minutes of professional development and hold biweekly grade  team meetings to discuss student progress and identify targeted skills for intervention.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   In grade level teams, teachers use both baseline data from New York City ELA Performance tasks and formative assessments to  identify specific areas of struggle. Teachers in grade-level teams discuss both content and language considerations for ELLs.  Our school firmly believes that language learning is a continuum and that academic language skills need to be supported at all  levels of proficiency. Our ENL teacher holds professional development for all staff on how to to provide ELLs with both  content-rich instruction and language development. Grade teams and grade advisers regularly meet to identify struggling  students and several interventions are available outside the classroom. Every teacher offers tutoring twice a week, ELLs are  provided with two days per week of small group, intensive tutoring, 9th grade students are provided with teacher mentors,  and students in the higher grades are provided with student mentors.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use NYSESLAT, Regents and the New York City ELA Performance Task to evaluate our program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Results are disseminated at  grade teams meetings, department meetings, and with grade advisors, programmers, and  administration through meetings and email.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Entering students are programmed for three ENL classes per day, all of which are co-taught by by our ESL teacher and  ELA teacher. Emerging students are programmed for two ENL classes per day, both co-taught with our ESL teacher  and ELA teacher. Expanding and transitioning students receive one ENL class per day, co-taught by our ESL and ELA  teacher. Students are grouped by both proficiency and grade level. FELL students are programmed for one co-taught  class to provide additional support for two years.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               Our grader advisor, ESL teacher, programming office, and assistant principal work closely to analyze the results of the  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL to ensure that our students receive the mandated instructional minutes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Our ELA and ESL teacher regularly collaborate and coteach content in the ENL class. Other content areas are taught in  English. Content teachers regularly confer with our ESL teacher to discuss modifications to lessons and strategies to make  content comprehensible to English language learners. Native language dictionaries and content glossaries are available for  students in every content class. Students are provided with Regents exams in both English and their native language.  Teachers  employ strategies such as modeling, scaffolding, visuals, collaborative work, and a variety of different media including films  and songs to facilitate content and language acquisition. All teachers receive professional development in how to implement  the Common Core Standards and staff development focuses on how to scaffold instruction to help ELLs meet the demands of  the standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In order to determine a student’s proficiency in their native language, we enlist the services of a staff member who speaks that  language to conduct an informal interview with the student. If we don’t have a staff member available who speaks the  student’s language, we informally assess the student with a translated text and ask the student to read a portion of it.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status        a. Students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) receive ESL services as well as a literacy support class to help them  develop their academic skills. SIFE students are referred to their guidance counselor for additional services as necessary.  SIFE  students meet with their ESL teacher during lunch for tutoring as well as after school.            b. If an ELL has been in NYC city  schools for less than three years and scores as entering on the NYSESLAT, he or she will receive three ESL classes per day  designed to accelerate academic reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. Entering ELLs also receive lunch time tutoring  with our ESL teacher. Students are provided with after-school tutoring across the content areas as well as small group tutoring  across content-areas specifically for ELLS. ELA instruction is embedded in the ESL classes.             c. Developing ELLs are  programmed for ESL classes depending on their level of proficiency per the NYSESLAT. Students attend after school tutoring  across content areas as well as small group tutoring specifically for ELLs across the content-areas.            d. Long-term ELLs are  programmed for ESL classes based on their level of proficiency per the NYSESLAT. Long-term ELLs may also be programmed for  literacy support classes in ELA and history. They also attend content-area tutoring and small group tutoring specifically for  ELLS.           e. Former ELLs are programmed for a transitional ESL class for one year. Their progress is tracked by the ESL teacher  and the grade advisor. In addition, they are programmed for a co-taught support class for two years.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELL-SWDs are grouped together with our general education ELLs. The teachers employ scaffolding techniques that focus  on the development of academic language and oral and written expression. The teacher employs read alouds, partner and  small group reading groups and supplies students with dictionaries, glossaries, websites and supplementary materials.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49       ELL-SWDs are placed in general education ESL classes. Our grade advisors work with our ESL teacher to discuss modifications  per IEP and the ESL teacher implements, with the help of paraprofessionals, to deliver a content-rich curriculum.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Performance data for ELLs is regularly reviewed by individual teachers, grade level groups, our ESL teacher, and our bilingual  grade advisor. Across content-areas, students use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries. Teachers scaffold lessons to make  content accessible to English language learners. Content tutoring is provided for ELLS in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies.  Services are offered in English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Xhenete Shepard, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
