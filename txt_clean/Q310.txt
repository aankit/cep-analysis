This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Queens Collegiate is a community of continuous learners that fosters a caring and creative environment. Through our  holistic approach to education, our students will adopt academic and personal behaviors that lead to success in  college and beyond.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At Queens Collegiate, we inspire a passion for continuous learning. Our holistic approach to learning includes global  understandings, a commitment to arts education, scientific exploration, technology and strong communication skills.  It is our responsibility to facilitate active learning, celebrate achievements and mistakes, and support each other  through challenges. We are positive change agents in the world, and will purposefully seek out academic and personal  behaviors that prepare us for success in college and beyond. Partnerships with families, corporations and community  based organizations enrich our environment.    Queens Collegiate is a secondary school with 665 students, grades 6 through 12. The school population comprises  47% Black, 14% Hispanic, 2% White, 25% Asian and 8% American Indian, Alaskan Native or Pacific Islander students.  The student body includes 9% English language learners and 14% students with special needs. Boys account for 50%  of the students enrolled and girls account for 49%. The average attendance rate for the 2017-2018 school year was  90.6%.    We have developed strategic collaborations and partnerships with Queens Community House, which provides an  after-school program for 60 middle school students each day from 2:45-5:15PM. They have incorporated arts, dance,  counseling, and forensics into their enriched after-school offerings. We also have developed a partnership with the  MSQI Debate Network, MSQI Science Fair and CHAMPS athletics programs for middle school students. Additionally,  we have strong programs internally, which run gender-specific support for our most at-risk boys and girls in grades 7- 12.    According to the last Quality Review, Queens Collegiate met or exceeded the expectations in the following areas:    Rigorous Instruction   Supportive Environment    Strong Family & Community Ties   Student Achievement       According to the last School Quality Review, our areas for focus are:    1. Strengthening teachers' assessment practices to reflect effective feedback resulting in instructional adjustments  and clear next learning steps to improve student outcomes. (2.2)    2. Further engage teacher teams in inquiry work to enhance teacher leadership and promote greater emphasis on  instructional shifts to amplify student progress. (4.2)    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10               3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Just under nine percent of our students are English Language Learners. Many of those students have recently  immigrated to America, and a smaller percentage has had interrupted education. Our students with these needs  require intensive vocabulary instruction, in context with other content, along with writing and sometimes handwriting  instruction.    Nearly eighteen percent of our students have special needs, as identified by an Individualized Education Plan. Their  learning needs vary according to their individual needs. Some require integrated co-teaching classes to meet their  needs, while others are best serviced in a self contained or SETSS class. As a school, we flexibly program so students  may a combination of services to best meet their individualized needs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the past year, we have made the most progress in building teacher teams and a collaborative school community.  Nearly every teacher has time on their schedule for collaborative team meetings, typically by grade, where student  conferencing, academic planning, social-emotional planning and intervention occurs. We have also built a system  for evaluating student writing and providing feedback to improve writing.    In the 2018-2019 school year, we want to continue the work in teacher teams, both grade teams and collaborative  teaching teams, and in inquiry targeted to improve writing.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 28Q310   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   671   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The high school graduated 88% in four years and 87% in six years according to the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide.  We found that while we were successfully graduating students, we are concerned about the quality of essay writing.  This is evidenced by the fact that 48% of students are preforming below grade level on the NYS middle school  assessments and our performance on the ELA Regents metric of 2/4 on our Quality Snapshot. We have analyzed  writing sampled to determine that writing a claim, supporting it with relevant evidence are strengths for our students.  Tying our sources with personal experience and using appropriate spelling and conventions are two areas for growth.  Additionally, we need to establish stronger systems for teachers and their peers to provide useful feedback to  improve student writing.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All QC staff is highly qualified. They run the gamut from first year teachers to those with over fifteen years. Our  intention is to always hire the best person for the job. We also work to make certain the employee is a good match for  our school. We require the utmost commitment from our teachers to grow and learn exponentially with the students  for the students’ benefit.    Toward that end, prospective teachers begin a multi-layered hiring process. Teachers contact us when they have an  interest in our school. Administration cull the submitted resumes to find the very best qualified applicants in the areas  we need staff. We vet the resume by calling recommendations and send the applicant an email with bullet points of  expectations of staff at QC. Applicants whose resumes pass muster are then invited to an Open House. The Open  House includes a writing sample, observations and conversations with current staff, a demonstration followed by a  debrief with students, and a deep conversation with administration and the Hiring Committee.    Our teachers know they are valued and would not be here if we did not know they were skilled and willing to grow  professionally. We put a priority on providing meaningful support to staff as they work to improve student  achievement and their own practice. Because of this and the fine school we have with engaged and caring students,  we have very little staff turnover. We still have four staff members who founded our school in 2008.       Staffing assignments are created based upon previous experience in the intended area/grade, success rates as  measured by applicable student achievement metrics, and staff desire/interest as measured by the preference sheet.  In general, we prefer to have continuity with teachers teaching in a particular grade for multiple years, so they can  refine their pedagogical practice, which benefits the children as they are a master of their content and grade.    Because we are a small school with a small budget, we need to use everyone as efficiently as possible. Our staff works  very hard as we program to offer our students the experiences, courses, and opportunities necessary for graduation  and college preparedness. This requires teachers to go above and beyond constantly and consistently to meet these  needs. All of our teachers have opportunities for professional development and we encourage our staff to learn as  much as they can. We have professional development at school every Monday afternoon. Weekly PD allows us to  make real headway in the initiatives from the DOE and from the goals and missions that our school prioritizes. This   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      year we are prioritizing social emotional growth using community building and restorative circles and academically  building inquiry to improve student writing across the content areas.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   We have bi-weekly professional development as an entire staff to ensure our students’ work meets CCSS. This  involved reviewing student work products, analyzing gaps and designing interventions within the classroom to meet  those gaps. Additionally, teachers collaborate on Monday mornings to ensure alignment between classes. On Tuesday  afternoons, teachers engage in parent outreach to provide support for our families.      Paraprofessionals participate in team meetings to better understand the goals and practices within the grade or  department. Additionally, they regularly attend PD with the Borough Field Support Center.       The principal and school leaders regularly attend professional development with a number of organizations (ELI, AP  for All, Algebra for All, MSQI, Superintendent, International Institute for Restorative Practices, etc).

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Grade and department team teacher-leaders meet every other week with the Principal and the Assistant Principal to  discuss instructional and logistic decisions. We analyze the benefits of each assessment and determine which provides  the information we need to make informed curricular decisions.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Queens Collegiate, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Queens Collegiate will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Queens  Collegiate currently has seven certified ENL teachers providing instruction for our Title III OST  program: Ms. Francesca Altes, Ms. Nancy Rosendo, Ms. Leona Dalphond, Ms. Terrie Gyles, Ms.  Tanjila Rezwan, and Mr. Mandeep Singh. Ms. Aliya Ladha is an ELA teacher in the process of  earning her ENL certification. Ms. Marzan is a Spanish teacher who already has an ELS  certification. The primary language of instruction for all of the programs will be English, with  support as needed in home languages Bengali and Spanish. Queens Collegiate will provide the  following programs of OST support using Title III funding:    1. Middle School Programs  The middle school supplemental instructional program is needed to provide support for ELL  students outside of the mainstream general education classroom. During the school day, middle  school ENL students have one ENL teacher who pushes into their mainstream classes. However,  the students need additional support to help them succeed and to prepare them for the rigor of the  high school curriculum. Content area teachers have noted that Middle School ENL students  struggle with close reading of grade level texts, differentiating between narration styles,  extracting meaning from text features, and making text-based inferences. The ELA 2016-2017  State exam shows that our middle school ELLs scored at levels 1 and 2. Students in the MS  supplemental program will be grouped heterogeneously by proficiency. There will be one class  in one classroom with a student-teacher (certified ENL) ratio of 10:1.    a. After-school Reading Workshop  The Reading Workshops will be held once weekly on Thursday afternoons from 3:01 pm until  4:01 pm with a certified ELA/ENL teacher.  The instructional focus of the workshops will be the  development of close reading strategies. These workshops will provide students with mini  lessons consisting of specific vocabulary building, reading, and grammar strategies that students  can use to successfully complete classwork and homework assignments across the content areas.  Students will study mentor texts in the informational, argumentative, and narrative genres.  Newsela, a website that offers leveled articles, will be used to provide students with  informational mentor texts that are at the reading and interest level of the participating students.  In addition, Scholastic Action, a classroom magazine for below-level readers, will be purchased  to provide students with accessible science and social studies texts to help build our students'  reading confidence, reading endurance, vocabulary, and background knowledge. Students will  gain fluency in reading literature, but also in the academic language that surrounds analysis and  discussion of texts.    Qualitative data used in the design of this program included student artifacts from academic year  (2017-18) and anecdotal data from prior and current content teachers. Quantitative data used to  support this program included 2016-17 ELA State examination scores and in-house scores on  semester progress reports.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   The Reading Workshops will serve ten (10) students with ELP designations of Transitioning and  Expanding, and three (3) students with ELP designations of Commanding (F-ELL), but who  have demonstrated need for continued support or intervention. The hour-long workshops will be  held from late October 2018 until May 2019 for 22 sessions (due to facilitator availability).    2. High School Programs  In order to succeed in cognitively demanding high school courses, many of our ELLs require  extra time and support with trained and enthusiastic faculty. An after school program, or “9th  period,” will give students additional opportunities for help from ESL-certified instructors  (multiple of whom are dually certified). The overall goal of the Title III High School  Supplementary Instruction program is to advance students' English Language Proficiency in all  modalities, particularly in the domains of history, science, English, and mathematics. The  program seeks to impart practical and essential skills to our students, with the aim of helping  them to access the language and content necessary for academic success. In these programs,  students will be grouped heterogeneously by proficiency. There will be multiple classes, but  student-teacher ratio in each classroom will not exceed 15:1. ENL teachers will lead teach,  parallel teach, or team teach, depending on the objective(s) of the day. The goal(s) of the high  school programs will be achieved through the implementation of activities listed below.    a. After-school Global Seminar  The Global Seminar will be held Thursday afternoon from 3:01 pm until 4:31 pm with one  ENL/global studies teacher. The instructional focus of the seminar will be geography and  historical contexts - topics closely aligned with the high school curricula of Global Studies, Earth  Science, and even Living Environment. The intention of this seminar is to instruct and provide  students remedial lessons in the skills and knowledge required not only for success in core  curriculum courses and Regents examinations, but also to challenge students in developing a  sense of the world around them and an understanding of the interconnectedness of peoples  around the globe. Depending on the cohort, this includes geography-related tasks (such as  determining longitude and latitude), comprehension questions (such as locations of continents  and countries), essays (such as explaining the influence of a geographic feature on the  development of a culture), analyzing historical documents, and discussing historical trends.    Rationale: This seminar was created in response to qualitative and quantitative data indicating  that our ENL students across the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades have a demonstrated need for  supplemental instruction addressing skills and topics mentioned above, which are essential for  their academic success and civic development. In developing the seminar, the program designers  used extensive feedback from the Global Studies teachers and ENL co-teachers for history  courses. Student artifacts (journal entries, Do Nows, exit slips, thematic essays, and test items)  were also analyzed and informed the design of the Global Seminar. Additionally, ENL and  content teachers for Global 9 and Global 10 analyzed scores from end-of-year assessments for  Global 9 and the Global Studies and Geography Regents examination. The quantitative data  provided by these assessments showed low scores (failing) for ELLs, particularly in geography- related questions, questions requiring analysis of historical documents and maps, questions  requiring great historical context (often from a Western perspective), and construction of  document-based essays.    Our students find difficult the task of connecting the physical world to their understanding of the  narrative of the past and how geography has influence upon historical context. Furthermore, our  ENL students have expressed curiosity about these very topics. ELLs in particular deserve to  discover answers to questions such as the following, which have surfaced from these students in  recent academic years: Why do I speak Spanish when I was born in El Salvador? Where is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Honduras (or Bangladesh) in relation to New York and why is it so different [in terms of climate,  culture, and biome]? Why are the people in [a specific part of the world] Muslim while the  people in [Europe] are mostly Christian? Are Catholics Christians? Why are there no Indians  [Native Americans] here? What happened between Bangladesh and Pakistan / why does we  [Bangladeshis] hate people from Pakistan? Why are there white people in `Africa and where are  they? What are natural resources from my home country?   The Global Seminar will include a significant portion of study on the Middle Ages. Our ENL  team - in collaboration with the History Department at our school - have created a series of  lessons, discussions, and activities over Medieval social classes, science, technology, arts,  warfare, dress, and way of life.  The Global Seminar will serve a maximum of 30 students with ELP designations of all ELPD  levels, including F-ELL. When the number of students attending the session exceeds 15, an  additional ENL teacher will assist in facilitating the session. The seminar series will commence  during the fourth week of September 2018 and run through May 2019 for 40 sessions.        b. After-School Reading & Writing Workshop  The HS Reading Workshops will be held Friday afternoon from 3:01 - 4:01 pm with one ELA  teacher, currently in progress toward her ENL certification. This teacher has worked closely with  two ENL-certified instructors in creation of this after-school program. The instructional focus of  the workshops will be the development of close reading strategies and essay-writing techniques.  These workshops will provide students with mini lessons consisting of specific vocabulary- building, reading, and writing strategies that students can use to successfully complete classwork  and homework assignments in all content-areas, as well as to prepare for the ELA Regents exam.  Students will study mentor texts in the informational, argumentative, and narrative genres.  Reading passages from Leveled Texts For Classic Fiction: Shakespeare, Leveled Texts for  Classic Fiction: Mythology, Leveled Texts For Social Studies: World Cultures Through Time  will serve as mentor texts that target the reading and interest level of the participating students.  In addition, Scholastic Action, a classroom magazine for below-level readers, will be purchased  to provide students with accessible science and social studies texts to help build our students’  reading confidence, vocabulary, and background knowledge.    Qualitative data used in the design of this program included student artifacts from previous  academic years until spring semester of 2018, as well as anecdotal data from teachers of ELA,  Global Studies, Living Environment, and ENL. Quantitative data used to support the design of  this program included analysis of recents years' ELA Regents results, May 2017 NYESLAT, and  fall 2017 NYSITELL scores.    The HS Reading Workshops will serve 12 ENL students with ELP designations of Emerging,  Transitioning and Expanding. The Reading Workshops will meet for 20 sessions, commencing  during the fourth week of November 2018 and running through May 2019.    c. Saturday Science Seminar  Science Seminar will be held from 10 a.m. until 12 p.m. over 12 Saturday sessions from  December 2018 to May 2019. This seminar will focus on building knowledge and skills for the  core content classes of Living Environment, Chemistry, and Physics. The Science Seminar will  be taught by a dually-certified Science and ENL teacher. The seminar will serve up to 20 ENL  students designated as ELP Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding. Many of these students are  long-term ELLs. One third of this group of students will be taking the Living Environment  Regents examination for a second or third attempt during the 2018-19 school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information     Science Seminar will feature model-building (cell model, biome model, body systems model,  resource competition model, atomic model), focused instruction on vocabulary in science  contexts, strategies for reading as a scientist with Limited English Proficiency, and strategies for  writing as a scientist.  The language of instruction will be English with some home language  instruction in Hindi and Punjabi.    Qualitative data used in the design of this program included student artifacts from Living  Environment during academic year 2017-18 and anecdotal data from ENL and Living  Environment content teachrs. Quantitative data used to support this program included analysis of  scores from the January and June 2018 Living Environment and Chemistry exams, as well as  from gradebooks for these courses.    d. Math After-School  Math After-School will be held Tuesday from 3:01 pm until 4:01 pm.  Rationale: Qualitative data demonstrates a true need for remedial and supplemental instruction  for students to meet (and exceed!) standards for our entry mathematics course - Algebra 1. To  support these students - particularly newcomers, beginners, and ELLs with IEPs - in developing  mathematical thinking and in gaining fundamental skills for this domain, Ms. Rezwan (certified  in mathematics with ENL extension) has designed a weekly after-school program focused on  math strategies and scenarios, including many real-world applications for the mathematical  skills. This component of the high school after-school programs will be held over 35 sessions  from October 2018 through May 2019. The language of instruction will be English with some  home language instruction in Bengali. This component will serve up to 20 students with ELP  designations from Entering to Expanding.    e. Photography Club  Photography Club will be held Thursday from 3:01 pm until 4:01 pm. A certified ENL teacher  facilitates this club, which will serve 15 to 20 students with ELP designations of Entering  through F-ELL. The goals of photography club are: to promote observation, to encourage  creativity, and to develop language to write and speak about art. The club works on a number of  levels, from building students' Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) in a welcoming  space for newcomers, beginner ELLs, and recent immigrants, to introducing and exploring a  series of academic vocabulary and concepts, including but not limited to: perspective; lens; focal  point; develop; background; foreground; and source.  Rationale: This group was a student-created and student-led initiative in 2017-18 which became  both a community space for ELLs and immigrants, as well as an excellent bridge between  student interest and the school curriculum, between BICS and CALP (cognitive academic  language proficiency). The club also serves as an additional channel through which we celebrate  the talents and achievements of our emergent bilinguals. This component of the programs will  use 20 hours of per session funding.     Part 3:  Queens Collegiate will allocate 10% of our Title III budget to purchasing supplies for our OST  program. The Global Seminar program will require individual world maps for each participating  student, at a total cost of $112.50 for 30 world maps. The Middle School and High School  Reading Workshops will require the following supplies: a subscription to Scholastic Action, at a  total cost of $346.11 for a 35 member subscription, a whiteboard easel to provide targeted  instruction, at a cost of $80.61 for 1 easel, 3 Leveled Text Sets, at a total cost of $119.97. This  fund will also be used for refreshments and snacks necessary for our parent engagement  activities, at a cost of $250 (see part D below).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               Queens Collegiate will dedicate 10% of our Title III funding to provide professional  development. This Professional Development will be held on Tuesdays from 3:01 to 5:01 pm or  on Fridays from 4:30 to 5:30 pm for a total of 8 sessions throughout the year as needed. The  professional development component of Title III will be reserved for the collaboration of the  ENL team with content teachers, as this 2 hours and 15 minutes each week is needed for ENL  teachers to work collaboratively in development of cross-curricular lessons for the Title III  Global Seminar, which will align with recent material either from Living Environment, Global 9,  or Global 10. Additionally, ENL and content teachers will use this time to collaborate on the  creation of course materials, projects, and associated rubrics which specifically address ELLs’  English Proficiency development. Professional collaboration will begin the first week of the  academic year in September 2018 and continue through June 2019. This component of the  program will use 24 hours of per session funding.

The Language Access Coordinator will ensure that parents are notified of the  advocacy workshops in their preferred languages in advance of the commencement of the  workshop series.  This component of the program will use 10 hours of per session.  For the 2018-19 school year, QC would like to offer three workshops or/and information  sessions. The workshops/information sessions will be around one (1) hour to an hour and a half  in duration.  Each workshop will require approximately two hours for development - including  recording (and possible editing) and uploading documents to a web platform to allow for greater  outreach.  Session #1: FAFSA Night with Interpreters (November 20, 2018 at 6-8:30 pm)  This informational session will focus on: filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid for  our ELLs and former ELLs who are in the process of applying for college. Facilitators will make  a concerted effort to reach out to ELL families and will field questions from in multiple  languages with the support of interpretive services.  Session #2: ENL at QC (rescheduled to December 12, 2018 at 5-6:30 pm)  This informational session will focus on: the lived experience of ENL at our school; how parents  can be aware about, communicate with, and be involved with the school; and rights and  responsibilities for ELLs and their families.  Session 3: On the Path to Success (March 4, 2019 at 5-6:30 pm)  This workshop will focus on: long-term planning for college and career; practical steps ELLs and  families can take on their pathway; explanation of language and experiential learning  opportunities for ELLs; and what makes a college applicant stand out. This workshop will be  open to all grades, but will be most appropriate for families of students in grades 9-11.     Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At the middle school level, our school takes part in MSQI's Word Gen program, ensuring that the teachers of grades 6-8 are  tracking the reading data for the students. The data show that reading at the middle level is far below grade level and lags  behind grade level in the high school as well. Our school extracts data from previous years' NYSESLAT and current NYSITELL  assessments, periodic assessments, and teacher-created assessments which are often derived from Regents-based prompts  and tasks. These assessments typically incorporate a significant writing component (minimum one essay) and provide teachers  with greater insight into students' content and linguistic readiness for sitting for a high stakes end-of-year test. The school's  teachers use this data to inform instruction, as all educators are responsible for supporting literacy and language  development. ESL and content teachers ensure ELLs are taught the basic skills needed to support comprehension by leveling  texts for appropriate reading levels, delivering explicit language instruction embedded in the context of an academic  disciplines, and building opportunities for reading, both independent and guided, within the classroom. Teachers focus too on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      imparting reading strategies and units that recycle academic vocabulary, in addition to making available language resources  such as dictionaries and Internet L1-L2 translation support.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our school schedules regular after-school mandatory professional development sessions, as well as daily collaborative periods  between ENL coordinators and content teachers for the purpose of sharing information regarding formative assessments. Each  grade team 6-12 meets multiple times per week to review data and anecdotal information on their students. Teachers keep  ongoing notes from theses meetings in a common Google Doc shared. Our staff also meet during professional development  hour after school to preview assessments and review assessment data. Additionally, the ENL coordinators meet weekly with  school leadership to review ELL data and assessments.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our ENL programs are evaluated in numerous ways. School administrators and the ESL team review data from the NYSESLAT,  Regents examinations, and New York State assessments as a broad scope of ELL success in standardized tests both  administered strictly to ELLs as well as to the general student body.      Teachers at QC are mandated by school leadership to administer baseline, midpoint, and summative assessments throughout  the year. These assessments are due to school leadership at the start of the academic year and are shared with the school staff  on a Google Doc. During professional development hour, teachers review assessments and assessment results across all  content of their grade level. These assessments typically align closely with Regents examination prompts and tasks for each  academic discipline. Whenever appropriate, the assessments include a significant writing component, as our school places a  strong emphasis in writing across the curriculum.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our grade teams meet almost daily during an intentionally-scheduled period and respond to the summative data by  implementing interventions as appropriate.  These interventions include bringing students into small group instruction (either  during class or during an advisory/AIS period), setting the student up with after-school support in Title III or another program  to meet her/his needs, scheduling the student for Saturday program, making outreach to parents for evening tutoring, or  providing online supports to struggling students. We also reach out to the parent to ensure they are aware of their child's  academic performance.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable: QC serves grades 6-12.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our ENL team uses data from NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, periodic assessments, State ELA and Mathematics exams, and Regents  exams in Global Studies, Living Environment, and US History.    The data reveal a number of patterns that assist QC in devising effective programming to meet our students' needs.  Many  long-term ELLs are those with IEPs. Long-term ELLs are also disproportionately of Spanish-speaking backgrounds who have  transferred to QC from the Bronx and struggle with writing components of standardized tests while having achieved  commanding proficiency in the speaking modality. The data also show that lower proficiency students and those at the middle  school level see faster development of English language proficiency.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL team maintains an ENL Master document that encapsulates meaningful information about our ELLs.  At the start of  the academic year, all school educators and critical staff receive instruction and support in reading and using the ENL Master  data to guide their instruction and classroom decisions pertaining to our emergent bilinguals.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Each 45-minute class in our freestanding ENL program is designed to support small-group instruction (up to 12  students) amongst students from no more than two consecutive grade bands. Freestanding ENL classes are only  taught by certified TESOL or ENL educators. Students in these courses are grouped heterogeneously in mixed  proficiency levels, though are primarily of entering, emerging, or transitioning proficiency. Students in ENL receive  direct language support in English, as well as some support in their home languages to assist in building common  underlying proficiencies in literacy. We focus on reading and writing strategies, vocabulary acquisition, community- building, and instilling habits of using academic language. Our ENL courses are integrated with content areas, too. For  example, Ms. Dalphond aligns her lessons with themes and content Global Studies. This focus allows for the recycling  and reinforcement of language and helps students build background and comfort in that academic domain. Ms.  Dalphond and Ms. Rosendo both emphasize developing strong writing and teach the CER writing format, which  organizes students' written responses into providing a claim, evidence, and reasoning.     Additionally, ELLs receive the support of ENL co-teachers or ENL-certified co-teachers in their content area classes. For  example, Ms. Dalphond (ENL certified) co-teaches Living Environment and Ms. Altes (ENL certified) co-teaches Global  Studies). In these classes, ELLs are grouped strategically by language and proficiency level. When possible, all entering  through transitioning level students are grouped with a home language peer. ELLs are also grouped with general  education students to support their real-world English interaction. The ENL teacher and content teacher regularly  meet to modify the curriculum as needed, implement instructional and language supports, and to discuss language  and content goals, as well as students' progress toward meeting them. During instructional periods, teachers strive for  the team teaching model of co-teaching, but also use the models of "one lead, one support" and ...   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable: QC does not currently support TBE programs.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable: QC does not currently support DL programs.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our school has a small, dedicated team of ENL coordinators and supporting staff who pore through ATS reports and student  schedules to ensure that our emergent bilinguals receive the mandated appropriate number of instructional minutes per CR- 154. We keep track of our information in a Google spreadsheet, which we update frequently. Our ENL coordination team  meets regularly every Wednesday with administration and, as needed, the programmer and grade-appropriate guidance  counselor. Our school also uses the program STARS, which keeps track of ENL mandated minutes and automatically flags and  generates weekly reports on students who may be out of compliance or have conflicting schedules for services.    The vast majority of our ELL and f-ELL students receive more service minutes than mandated by the State. Entering, emerging,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      and transitioning students are placed in freestanding ENL classes, where they receive direct language instruction from an ENL- certified teacher for 45 minutes every day (225 minutes per week). These students are also scheduled for an integrated  ELA class every day (an additional 225 minutes per week). These students receive further support in content classes, often  from those same ENL-certified teachers; they may also receive additional language support from a content teacher with an  ENL extension. Expanding and former ELLs are scheduled for a minimum of one class (45 minutes daily, or 225 minutes weekly)  every day with a certified ENL teacher.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered in English. ENL teachers co-teach (or push-in) most frequently and pull out/aside entering and  emerging ELLs as needed to provide appropriate language support. Our culture at QC understands that all teachers are  teachers of ELLs and therefore responsible for developing English language proficiency. ENL and content teachers work  together to set appropriate learning goals and criteria for success for ELLs. When appropriate, texts are offered in the L1 or  teachers provide a glossary in the home language for newcomers and developing ELLs. ENL teachers: establish language  objectives for each lesson: modify texts, daily activboard presentations, and course materials; add culturally appropriate  examples and reference points; and bring in realia to demonstrate explanations. ENL teachers design cross-curricular units in  which students have numerous opportunities to cycle through the modalities in the targeted language forms and vocabulary.  All teachers focus on the development of CALP (cognitive academic language proficiency) in order to progress toward exit  exams (Regents) and prepare students for college.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are given the opportunity to take bench mark assessments and formal assessments/ practice assessments (NYS Regents)  in their native languages when applicable.  The teachers for ELA 9, ELA 10, Global 9, Global 10, Algebra I & II, Etymology, and  Living Environment also allow ELLs to write in Bengali or Spanish to demonstrate their knowledge. These teachers then  collaborate with a native speaker of that language to evaluate the students' academic language and content knowledge, and -  if applicable - the student's ability to construct a well-organized paragraph using at minimum CER criteria.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction for ELL subgroups is informed through test performance and learner profiles and is modified throughout the year in  order to best serve our students. Our school has two incoming SIFE student whose needs will be determined and  accommodated at the start of the new academic year. Content teachers will be informed of this students' SIFE status in order  that we may work to support the students in building skills or meeting socioemotional needs.   ENL teachers use the new English Language Arts Progressions standards to differentiate instruction for newcomer and  developing students. , particularly those at entering and emerging proficiency, are programmed for placement in freestanding  ENL courses, where they can receive the direct language instruction, enjoy space to formally practice basic interpersonal  communication skills (BICS), and study topics related to intercultural communication (such as pragmatic competence) that will  help them succeed not only at Queens Collegiate, but in their careers and at college. ENL teachers co-teaching or pushing in /  pulling out of content classes differentiate for various ELL subgroups by process, product, and content.      Long term ELLs receive targeted instruction based on their individual challenges. For the long-term ELL population, ENL  teachers focus on strengthening literacy, particularly within the writing modality, with which this demographic struggles (as  revealed by data and observation).     Former ELLs are tracked for progress within the content core classes. Should the content and ENL teachers determine a need   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      for additional support, ENL teachers adjust differentiation for those students.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   • Use visuals that reinforce spoken or written words  • Provide sentence stems for oral responses and short written responses  • Provide a writing frame for extended constructed responses  • MODEL the process or provide a model of the final product  • Get students to notice cognates  • Employ gestures for added emphasis  • Adjust speech: Speak slowly; enunciate; use longer natural pauses; repeat words or phrases  • Exaggerate intonations at times.  • Stress high-frequency vocabulary words.  • Allow ELLs to access information and negotiate for meaning in their home languages  • Allow translanguaging - students can use all tools in their linguistic repertoire to complete a task/objective  • Use fewer idioms and clarify the meaning of words or phrases in context.  • Stress participatory learning  • Maintain a low anxiety level and be enthusiastic  * In addition, our ELLs are provided with technology to support ELL instruction and engage ELLs in reading comprehension  (Achieve 3000)         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In creating student program, our school prioritizes the needs of SWDs, closely followed by the needs of ELLs. The least  restrictive environment is always the first consideration for our ELL-SWDs. In writing IEPs for ELLs, an ENL teacher who teaches  the student serves on the IEP team and provides input regarding English Language Proficiency Development to the IEP team  members throughout the school year.     Additionally, as required by law, all teachers must read the IEPs of the students under their instruction by September 8. Our  school offers an annual review of the process of accessing SESIS and reviewing IEPs. Furthermore, this year we have a special  staff member whose position is to write IEPs and assist teachers in understanding and differentiating for them. These steps  enable teachers to prepare lessons and supports informed by their SWD students' individualized goals.    In terms of scheduling, many of our ELL-SWDs recieve ENL instruction with an ENL teacher or TESOL-certified co-teacher in one  period, then receive instruction from Special Education-certified content teachers or co-teachers in other periods throughout  the day. Typically, when a student requires special services on a weekly basis (for example, speech therapy), s/he is pulled  from an elective such as gym or rockband. Classroom teachers are very understanding of this arrangement, as we are all  working together to help the students meet their goals.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Queens Collegiate has targeted intervention for ELLs in ELA, Science, Social Studies, and Math using push-in support from our  ENL certified teachers. The ENL teachers provide scaffolds for materials and instruction for these students while the content  teacher directs the curriculum. We have team time, where members of the faculty can inquire about the  progress of our ELLs  across all content areas to ensure that our ELLs are succeeding to the maximum of their capacity. Particular attention is paid to  our beginner and long-term ELL students. Interventions for beginner ELLs involve keeping track of their work and ensuring they  are being fairly graded in their classes through modifications made to accommodate their language needs. For long-term ELLs,  particular attention is given to addressing the specific sub-area in which they need targeted support. In addition, the 9th grade   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      teachers have created an initative in which struggling students, including ELLs, are taken out of class and explicitly taught  targeted language instruction for that content area.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New for the 2017-18 Academic Year  • Our data show that we have an incoming 9th grade with high needs. Most incoming ELLs scored at a 2 or 3 on eighth grade  ELA exam. In addition, we have several ELLs who arrived late in the 2016-17 academic year who did not receive credit due to  non-attendance who have remained at the grade 9 level. In response to this information, our school leadership has made  moves to consolidate and strengthen the 9th grade team in the following ways. 1) Ms. Dalphond is now officially a 9th grade  team member (formerly servicing 9th and 10th graders). She co-teaches with the 9th grade ELA teacher, co-teaches Living  Environment, then teaches an Additional ELA / Etymology course for one period with the same students. Our school believes  that this blocking of students will allow the 9th grade team to focus on developing the students' language skills and provide  strong reinforcement of vocabulary and academic language. 2) We have hired a new ELA teacher who is currently enrolled in a  dual Master's program for Literacy & TESOL. We believe that this educator, combined with Ms. Dalphond's support, will  provide more effective instruction to our students most in need of support. 3) The 9th grade team (currently seven teachers)  have agreed to teach the CER (claim, evidence, reasoning) writing structure. We believe the uniformity across courses will train  students organize their thoughts and writing most effectively.     • In the 10th grade, we have a class of students with many ELLs who have passed the Living Environment Regents examination  in June 2017 or August 2017. However, these students passed this exam with scores lower than 70, indicating that they will  likely struggle with the next course in our school's curriculum: chemistry (also a Regents course). After reviewing these scores  and those of a baseline assessment carried out by the chemistry teacher, our school has responded by opening up a new  period of chemistry as a transitional course for those students who are not yet ready for the regular chemistry course offered  by this teacher. Also new this year: this teacher has set up an account on Khan Academy so that she can assign Spanish- language videos, homework, and assessments to Spanish-speaking ELLs.     • QC is making moves toward being a trauma-sensitive school. We know that these moves will help all students, not only ELLs,  feel more comfortable at the school and more open to learning. Multiple teachers applied for the Comfort Dog pilot program  during the June 2017 application window. Though no one was chose at our school, we will continue to apply during  subsequent application windows, as we believe this an important opportunity for several of our ELLs with high anxiety, as well  as others with emotional disregulation. Our school has adopted a Circles curriculum for Advisory classes. Students bond with  both their advisor and other classmates during simple activities and learn that they have a point person for their academic and  socio-emotional issues.     Continuing Programs from 2016-17 Academic Year  • Our school continues to push for writing portfolios or showcase portfolios to be kept for all students to demonstrate their  accomplishments and progress toward academic and language goals.     • Ms. Rosendo and Ms. Dalphond will again run a Title 3 after-school program focused on geography and historical thinking  skills  The program will meet two days a week from 3:00 - 4:00 pm.    • Attendance outreach will be conducted for the students who consistently miss a large amount of school days.       • NYSESLAT data also shows a group of Entering or Emerging students that will require additional support to meet the  academic demands of high school. Formative data from the students ENL and content-area teachers reveal that the students  have weak academic habits. These students will be asked to join a Title 3 after-school program focused on teaching academic  habits, including workshops dedicated to teaching test taking strategies, technology usage and homework help.                     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      In previous years, Queens Collegiate dedicated one class to beginner ELLs, so that they felt comfortable expressing themselves  in a low pressure environment. Class was dedicated to increasing language proficiency at a pace suitable to their needs. With  the new CR PART 154 Regulations, Queens Collegiate is unable to hold this class due to scheduling priorities.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our programming committee considers inclusion of ELLs in mainstream classes and enrichment opportunities to be a high  priority. ELLs receive push-in services of an ENL teacher or co-teacher in order to maximize their access to the authentic  spoken English of their peers and educators. Additionally, this programming allows ELLs to enroll in arts courses (art, theater,  music), rather than being pulled from these enriching classes for language support. QC staff offer academic assistance  throughout the year before, during, and after school and ENL teachers in particular offer ELLs homework assistance, additional  language instruction, and help with content courses after school through Title III programming.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our classrooms come equipped with smartboard technology, which offers teachers the ability to differentiate and scaffold  lessons by incorporating multimedia resources (videos for explanations that can be repeated at the students' discretion,  interactive maps, large and live screen to offer modeling of researching or performing tasks). Additionally, QC makes available  to students multiple carts of iPads and laptops. ELLs have often made use of online dictionaries and translation services while  using these forms of technology. In content area courses, this technology is used to access websites and apps featuring image- rich interactive learning games and activities to provide a more hands-on experience for ELLs. Our school uses textbooks, realia  (skeleton, clay for models, rocks and minerals, water stations), a functioning library, and a science laboratory with  microscopes, stop watches, and weather equipment to assist students in their academics.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As our school lacks Bangla-speaking educators, instruction in the home language is limited. Our Spanish-speaking ENL teacher,  Ms. Nancy Rosendo, has used her language skills to communicate with parents, quickly provide background, and help ELLs  make connections.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ENL students are programmed to take their core content subject classes at the appropriate grade that all students complete  these credits. An ENL teacher pushes into these classes to service the ELLs and offer support. In addition, students required to  have direct language instruction are programmed in a freestanding ENL class. Queens Collegiate reviews each ELL student's  program to ensure required services are provided and align to age and grade levels.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our classrooms come equipped with smartboard technology, which offers teachers the ability to differentiate and scaffold  lessons by incorporating multimedia resources (videos for explanations that can be repeated at the students' discretion,  interactive maps, large and live screen to offer modeling of researching or performing tasks). Additionally, QC makes available  to students multiple carts of iPads and laptops. ELLs have often made use of online dictionaries and translation services while  using these forms of technology. In content area courses, this technology is used to access websites and apps featuring image- rich interactive learning games and activities to provide a more hands-on experience for ELLs. Our school uses textbooks, realia  (skeleton, clay for models, rocks and minerals, water stations), a functioning library, and a science laboratory with  microscopes, stop watches, and weather equipment to assist students in their academics.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   When a new ELL is enrolled at Queens Collegiate, the family is greeted by one of the ENL teachers. During this time the teacher  takes the family on the tour of the school, explaining common procedures and daily activities. During the first initial 10 days of  enrollment, new students meet with an ENL teacher to be informally evaluated and administered the LAB-R/NYSITELL.  At this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         time, the teacher finds out about the student's background, home/life, interests, etc. A buddy is assigned by either the  guidance counselor (Ms. Macaluso) or an ENL teacher. This buddy usually speaks the same native language in order to help  answer any questions and assist in the newcomers first days of their transition.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Students at QC must enroll in one semester of Spanish, but may elect to enroll in advanced Spanish courses.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable: QC does not currently support dual language programs.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We have three main teachers of ELLs at our school. These teachers are Sydney Barnes, Nancy Rosendo, and Leona Dalphond.  Teachers of ELLs at Queens Collegiate constantly participate in professional development courses given by the NYC  Department of Education. In addition,  every Tuesday morning, our school has mandated professional development hour,  during which educators discuss different topics, including the teaching of ELLs.   News and PD Opportunities for Educators of ELLs are received by the QC ESL staff on a regular basis from our district contact.  ESL teachers attend outside professional development workshops and training sessions relating to language development and  how Common Core Learning Standards are to be integrated into the ESL programs. They also attend workshops that showcase  new research related to second language acquisition. All teachers (of gifted, general, and special education) and  paraprofessionals are engaged in collaborative teams where student work is examined, and progress of ELLs and SWDs is  particularly examined, discussed, and next steps planned. Staff also participate in monthly conferences conducted by  administration with professional development topics ranging from interpreting data for subgroups (including ELLs), to  communicating with all families (including families of ELLs). School secretaries and the parent coordinator attend district  training in order to meet the needs of all families, including those of ELLs, who come to or call on the school to meet their  children's needs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our ENL teachers hold in-house PD for the staff at QC on a monthly basis so that faculty/staff may obtain their 15%  professional development hours (ELL-specific). The main ENL teachers will continue to receive outside  professional development provided by the city. Proof of professional development attendance is recorded on a paper  document during in-school professional development hours, and logged electronically by the school leadership. ENL teachers  must document their ELL-specific PD with AP McMahon and the payroll secretary. ENL teachers turnkey information to other  teachers upon return to QC. ENL teachers keep their PD confirmation emails electronically and place copies of the materials  obtained from these events in the ESL Binder.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The goals of our ENL program are laid out to parents twice. The first is during the parent orientation after the student is  identified as an ELL following administration of the NYSITELL. During this orientation, parents watch a video (in their home  language) about the various models available to them in NYC for language education. This video explains each model and the  expected outcome for an education in each model. Next, the ENL teacher conducting the orientation shows the parents a  more simplified representation of these three models as a review of the information. This simplified representation includes a  visual for each program and a short description that we have found effective in communicating the goals of each program. We  also use this time to discuss the parents' expectations of their student. What do they expect for the student's English  acquisition journey? How do they view the child's daily experience in a classroom in the different models? Why do they believe  the child would be more successful in one program over the other? We gauge the parents' understanding of the second  language acquisition process and their knowledge of the benefits of bilingualism, as our school wishes to promote a culture of  bilingualism and biliteracy.     Mid-year, our staff schedule individual meetings with ELL parents to discuss students' language development progress. Our  ENL teachers use a colored graphic that represents the levels of ENL to indicate the starting point of the student (as  determined by the NYSITELL or previous year's NYSESLAT). At this time, we discuss the scores of language proficiency tests  from the students entry in our school (or the previous year for 9th and 6th graders) until the most recent language  assessment.     Additional anecdotal information, as well as portfolios and performance assessments, regarding language development are  also presented to the parent to demonstrate the student's development in the language. As an example, Ms. Rosendo keeps a  writing portfolio on all of her students. At the midyear parent meeting, Ms. Rosendo shows parents how the student  progressed from a 2 to a 3 in essay-writing. Ms. Rosendo uses the same criteria used by educators who score the Global  Studies Regents examination. Other teachers, such as the theater teacher, may join the meeting to address the students'  speaking modality or pragmatic competence. All teachers are welcome to provide evidence or anecdotal information regarding  the academic and linguistic progress of the student. This information is conveyed to the parent, often with use of the Language  Line interpreters, or with the assistance of our Bengali-speaking, Hindi-speaking, and Spanish-speaking faculty members.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parent involvement at our school is in need of a boost. Our school pushes back-to-school night and ENL and content  teachers make concerted effort to reach our ELL parents by phone, postcard, text, Whatsapp, and email. We also send a  handout home with the students. We do see some ELL family turnout at this event, particularly if the family has multiple  children enrolled at our school. Our ELL parents tend to be especially present for the first round of parent-teacher conferences  in the fall.     This is definitely an area of growth for our school in the 2017-18 academic year. We would like to have Ms. Altes run a  weekend book club for ELL mothers, as she was the leader of this club at a her previous school and reported high turnout for  the program. However, we are still in the planning stage of this endeavor. We also had a successful series of movie  screenings last year for our ELL students and would like to expand this monthly event to our ELL parents this year.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Queens Collegiate participates in Title III funding in which after school help and regents prep is offered. ENL teachers deliver  targeted instructional support using assessment, and data reporting. This learning environment also affords teachers to act as a  facilitator and to provide one on one support to any language learners who may be struggling in a particular area.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jaime Anne Dubei, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Queens Collegiate                                                                              School DBN: 28Q310  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During intake, parents indicate their preferred language of communication on the Home Language Survey (part  three). The school keeps this data on file, both in ATS and in the student records, a hard copy filing system in the  central office. Parents’ preferred languages are also listed on students’ emergency contact cards, which are also  kept securely in filing.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In emergencies, our school requests that all faculty and staff who speak or write non-English languages shared by our  families (namely Spanish, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Urdu, French, Arabic, and Punjabi) support us in our communication  efforts to make outreach to families in their preferred languages. The school requests outreach by phone and email  messaging. The school also notifies families of emergent situations by way of mailed paper documents and translated  documents distributed to students to bring home.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All faculty and staff will be made aware of this goal by attending an in-house ENL-focused PD (professional  development) hour at the start of each academic year. This PD is developed and facilitated by ENL teachers at our  school who also serve as ENL Coordinators, with one being the LAC for our school.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      As per the Chancellor’s regulation A-663, our school will determine within 30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment  the primary language spoken by the parent of each student enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English,  whether the parent requires language assistance in order to communicate effectively with the DOE. The school shall  maintain an appropriate and current record of the primary language of each parent. Such information must be  maintained in ATS and on the student emergency card. We will provide translation and interpretation services to all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      parents who require language assistance as described above, and we will educate our families on their rights to  receive such services and two-way communication between their child's home and educational institution.   At the entrance to our school, we have on display the multilingual poster in the LAC toolkit to welcome parents and  reassure them that they will be able to communicate with us in their preferred language.   Our school is also developing a multilingual website with key information and announcements related to our school  and students' education in NYC. This website will feature translations and interpretation for our most common home  languages. We expect the website to be functioning, though still in its developmental stages, by the start of the 2018- 19 academic year. On this website, parents who speak Bengali and Spanish will be able to request a call from our  school in their home language.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       During the in-depth annual meeting with ELLs’ parents, ENL team will distribute parent surveys regarding translation  services. This survey will be made available online in preferred languages as well.   When our website is functional, we would also like to invite several ELL parents to provide feedback either over the  phone or by email on ways to improve the website for families who prefer non-English home languages.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
