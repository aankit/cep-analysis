The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At P. S. 47, we are a family of learners who are committed to working together to provide an enriched and rigorous  curriculum in Literacy, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science. These subjects are taught cooperatively through the  “point of entry model” in an inclusive environment that motivates, challenges and addresses the individual needs of  everyone in our school. Teacher feedback, rubrics, accountable talk and independent reading are the vehicles through  which our students will achieve independence and work towards their goals.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The partnerships that P.S. 47 has made with the community over the years are crucial to our school’s culture. These  partnerships support our students, teachers and parents. Some of these partnerships include:   Police Athletic League (PAL): This CBO provides an after school program for 5 days a week for students of working  parents. This program ends at 6:00 p.m. each day.   Robin Hood Foundation: This is the fifth year that we have our Robin Hood Library. Ms. Davis, our Librarian, received  her Master’s in Library Science. She keeps the library up-to-date with current informational texts. Ms. Davis also  purchases materials for the library to align with the school projects and themes.   Trust for Public Land Playground: Our playground donated by Trust for Public Land has been supportive of so many  school activities like Cultural Day, Spring Fair and our Easter Egg Hunt. These activities are great for the social and  emotional development of the school community.   New York Cares: P.S. 47 has partnered with New York Cares for the past 14 years. New York Cares assists with  everything from gardening and planting tulips to painting murals and classrooms. They come to P.S. 47 once a year in  October.   CITE (Center for Teaching and Learning) Parent Partnership: This year P.S. 47 is partnering with CITE to provide on- going parent workshops on many different topics, from State Assessments to School Safety.    Parents as Arts Partners: Every Monday for five weeks, students and parents will meet with a resident artist to  engage in hands-on art activities. There is a culminating activity at the end of the program.   Inside Broadway Arts Program: This year our 5 th grade students worked with Inside Broadway. They focused on  music/dance from the Broadway play “Rock of Ages.”   Broadway Beat: Resident Theater Artist, Scott Laughead provides professional development for the teachers. Each  class will be involved with dance, drama and music to present a culminating event.    Boy Scouts of America: Every Thursday the boys of P.S. 47 meet with their Boy Scout Leaders. Once a year there is a  big trip. They also offer summer camp for the boys . Anti-Bullying Retreat: The Boy Scouts of America teach a  curriculum called “Respect for All.” Last year P.S. 47 was able to fund this event for grades 3, 4 and 5, which takes  place at the Boy Scout camp grounds in Alpine New Jersey. The counselors greet the teachers and take ownership of  the students for the day. The classes are divided into various workshops on “respect” and “rock-climbing.”   Grow NYC/Seed to Plate: This is a food and nutrition science partnership with grade 5. This program brings educators  and farmers in to work with students. The culminating event is a trip to the Farmer’s Market.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Literacy Support: Rona Levick works with the new teachers on grade 3 to provide support in guided reading,  independent reading and the alignment of student work to CCLS.

TEACHERS COLLEGE READING AND WRITING PROGRAM: Teachers college consultants provide on-going professional  development to the entire school to support the writing process at P.S.47.   Ballet Tech: All third grade students auditioned to see who would be eligible for free ballet classes in Manhattan at  the New York City Public School for Dance. Several students have been selected for the past three or four years. They  are bussed during school hours.    NYC Swim for Life: Students are bussed to the Gertrude Ederly Recreation Center. Students receive ten free lessons.  Students are given certificates at the end of the program. Ms. Warner holds an award breakfast for these students.  This year and last Ms. Warner was able to purchase swim trunks and bathing caps for the students.   Tennis NYC: Later this year 3 rd Grade students will begin tennis lessons. This is an initiative of Billy Jean King National  Tennis Center. Students receive free rackets and tennis balls.   World Vision Teacher Resources: With a $50.00 fee per school, teachers are allowed to shop for free at the Bronx  Teachers Resource Center. There are hundreds of supplies for teachers.   My Own Book Fund: $50 Dollar gift cards are given to third grade students to buy books at Barnes and Noble.   Cook Shop for Students and Parents: Students are taught how to eat nutritionally and make healthy meals in the  classroom. All of the teachers receive training.   Cool Culture: Our kindergarten parents receive passes that can be used for up to 30 different museums around the  city. This program educates parents and allows them to understand the importance of the arts and cultural  institutions.   Bronx Botanical Garden Partnership: The Bronx Botanical garden works with the Grade 4 students to plant a  vegetable and herb garden in our playground. Wooden flower boxes were created. Lessons are taught to the students  on ecology.   The Bronx Zoo Partnership: Two of our 4th grade teachers attend workshops throughout the year that model how to  use the Bronx Zoo as a valuable resource tool for the school.      This year P.S. 47 has several initiatives:   ● Raising our attendance is always one of P.S. 47’s initiatives. Higher attendance equates to higher student  achievement. Each day, the classes with 100% attendance are announced. Those classes do a “Happy Dance.” One of  our former students created the dance moves and videoed the P.S. 47students doing the dance to the song “Happy”  by Pharrell Williams. Every teacher has the video downloaded. The students love to make sure that they come to  school so that their class can do the “Happy Dance.” We have purchased “School Messenger.” School messenger  makes phone calls to parents when students are absent. Teachers make phone calls as well. Our current attendance  for this month is 95%.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      ● Independent reading is the heart of balanced literacy. Students will read independently for 20 minutes daily.  Students will read a minimum of 25 books independently. Each student has a “Home Reading Log” and a “Class  Reading Log.” Parents must monitor and sign the home reading logs. This year Grade 5 is piloting a program called  Light-Sail. I-pads were purchased for the grade to use this program. Since Grade 5 is departmentalized we needed to  purchase fewer I-pads. Students select their independent reading books. All of the titles are current authentic  literature. The program allows the teacher to monitor each student’s independent reading. The teacher can make  comments to the student as well.    ● Questioning is an important part of creating rigor in a lesson. This year teachers are focusing on questions using  Bloom’s Taxonomy stems. Students are gaining deeper understanding of text through discussions. As a school we are  working towards getting students to ask questions to each other. They should try and construct deeper meaning of  the text with their partners.    ● Differentiated Professional Learning for teachers is one of the best ways to support teachers’ professional needs. At  P.S. 47 differentiated professional development happens in many ways: pairing of teachers using the Associate  Model, mentor-ships, inter-visitations, review of "We Teach" video modules, consultation with Generation Ready  Consultant and Literacy support Consultant. Last year we began differentiating workshops on Monday afternoons by  using the data collected from the Danielson Observations. By studying the data collected in Advance, it allows you to  see what areas teachers are ineffective, developing, effective and highly effective in. We want to support all of our  teachers to move towards “highly effective” teachers.    ● Our school-wide behavior management program is called “HOOTS.” This positive behavior reinforcement supports  good behavior in the classroom, hallways, lunchroom, etc. Students receive “owl tickets” that can be cashed in for  prizes for positive behaviors. Good behavior school-wide gives students better self-esteem and provides an  environment that is conducive to learning. Good student behavior allows teachers to focus on instruction as opposed  to behavior management.    ● Each student throughout the school is being tracked on their independent reading level as measured by Fountas  and Pinnell. As a school we adjusted the levels by grade and by marking period to raise the standard.    ● Supporting partnerships with families to support students’ progress towards college and career readiness:   Tuesdays are designated as Parent Involvement Day. Teachers plan various activities. Parent workshops, Newsletters,  Parent Meetings to Review Attendance and Student Goals.   ● Title 1 parent involvement funds were used to purchase the Learning Leaders. Parents will be trained for three days  during December. They will also be fingerprinted and receive their badges so that they can be assigned to the early  childhood classrooms. This organization will also provide three workshops for the parent community: 1.Common Core  Learning Standards, 2. Achieving State Assessments and 3. Focusing On You Educationally.   ● Streamlined Progress Reports/Next Steps for Parents: Constant feedback is given to parents so that it is not too late  to give their child the intervention necessary to meet grade level standards. A “Next Steps Template” that is given to  parents with the Progress Report spells out the next step for parents to take to help their child. Next Steps are a  checklist for Math and ELA in Spanish and English. An example of a next step is, after your child reads to you, ask your  child to retell the story using beginning, middle and end.   ● Saturday English as a New Language (ENL) Program for Parents and Early Childhood Students: This program is  starting up in December. Spanish speaking parents will learn to speak English along with their kindergarten, first and  second grade children.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      ● Earlier this year P.S. 47 supported “Bring Your Dad to School Day.” Dads came to school and met with the  administration about the importance of fathers in their children’s lives. The dads later on went up into the classrooms  to do read-alouds. Assistant Principal Peay met with fathers last year in April for Father/Son Day. We are planning on  this event for this year.   ● Feedback to students regarding college and career readiness:   Grades 4 and 5 researched various colleges. Grade 5 worked on a writing task that responded to informational text.  Students developed opinions in writing. Students had to write about the pros and cons of going to college. The  students had to select a college based on their future career choice. We have scheduled “Career Day” for later in the  school year. 5 th Grade attended a trip to Queens College. Next Month they will attend a trip to Lehman College.      ● Teacher College Reading and Writing: This year we have officially selected by Teachers College to be part of The  Teachers College Reading and Writing Program. All teachers at P.S. 47 will receive on-going professional development  throughout the year in reading and writing. Two consultants provide ongoing professional development, one for  grades k through 2 and one for grades 3 to 5. The consultants set up lab classrooms where they model "best  practices" for the teachers in balanced literacy. They also provide workshops after school during Monday's  professional development time.   ● One of our greatest strengths at P.S. 47 is our teacher support and collaboration. Our organization is structured  throughout the school using the Associate Model. This model allows for “built-in” professional development.  Seasoned teachers are paired with new teachers during the 90-minute reading block. Each teacher divides the  students into two groups for guided and independent activities based on their ability levels. Students have reduced  adult to student ratio. There is also a Literacy Coach and a Math Coach to support teachers in curriculum planning or  areas where a teacher needs to develop. P.S. 47 also has a mentor program for new teachers. Consultants are also  used for literacy from “Generation Ready” and “Literacy Support.” The teachers work together for many different  activities: Curriculum Mapping, Lesson Planning, Teacher Teams, etc. As a result of our teacher support, the teacher  turnover rate for all teachers is 4% for teachers with fewer than 5 years-experience.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 47 is located in the Soundview section of the Bronx. This K-5 school serves an ethnically diverse population:  approximately 67.4% Hispanic, 18.32% Black, 8.15% Asian Pacific.5%, Native Indian and 1.75% White. P.S. 47 has a  population of 1,141 students; 92.81% are general education students and 7.19% are Special Education students. Of  the total student population 26.21% are English Language Learners (ELLs). The language spoken in the bilingual classes  is Spanish. The student population is heterogeneously grouped within each grade and supported by a pedagogical  staff of 80 teachers. Of these 80 teachers, 100% are certified and licensed. 46% have a masters plus 30 credits.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of our greatest accomplishments was getting the Robin Hood Library as a resource for our students and keeping  the library current. The library took five years in the making. This year we have replaced all of the computers in the  media center to keep the library as up-to-date as possible. Each year the librarian orders new books on current topics  and the “Best Sellers List” to keep the interests of children.    Additionally, another greatest accomplishment was to reduce the special education -referral rate by providing  intervention to less than 1% for our 1,141 students, which is below the city average. One of our greatest challenges  has been the increase of ELLs (English Language Learners) at P.S. 47. There are 26.21% ELLs in our bilingual and ENL  classes. The population seems to be on the rise. Also, the physical building is utilized at 140%. The school is built for       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      780 students while there are currently 1,141. Although the school runs in an organized manner, space sometimes  becomes an issue.   The area in which P.S. 47 made the most growth last year was in teacher development. Through the Danielson  Framework for teaching, 90% of the teachers were able to move from “developing” to “effective” in most  competencies. Additionally, our 5 th grade students scored 24% on grade level in Math for 2014, up from 10% the  previous year. In 2014 the number of level 1’s for grade 5 dropped to 49%, from the previous year at 69%.       For the 2017-18, on the grade 3 ELA, level 1's decreased from 42% the previous year to 21%. for the same year in  Math, level 1's decreased to 36% from 48%.    The key focus for the 2018-19 school year is as follows:   ● To provide a balanced approach to literacy, through the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program so that all  students at P.S. 47 will:   read and write on grade level through: shared reading/read-alouds, guided reading, independent reading, guided  writing and independent writing as they relate to the writing genres.   ● Teacher feedback that supports "next steps" for students, grows and glows.   ● Students will read a minimum of 25 books independently.   ● Students will gain deeper meaning of text through rich discussions and open-ended questions. Students will take  ownership of their questioning and discussion in the classroom by developing their own questions about a topic and  taking initiative in partner and whole class discussions.   ● Students will be able to complete Math "Problem of the Day" independently and explain their work.                      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X047   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1075   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   All testing grades, 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th totaled 26% on grade level on the 2017-18 ELA. English Language Learners totaled 1%  on grade level and Special Education students totaled 2.6% on grade level. This goal was formulated to increase ELA  scores for the 2018-19 school year, specifically on the writing part of the test.   Strength:    -Teachers are using the NYC ELA Rubric.   -Teachers are using the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program.   -Teachers are providing daily guided lessons with a strategic mini-lesson.   -Associate Model provides two teachers during Literacy Block reducing the adult to student ratio.   -For the 2017-2018 school year, Grade 3 reduced the number of Level 1's from 42% on the 2016-2017 ELA, to 21%.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           18      Weakness:   -On the 2017-2018 ELA State Test, Grade 5 Level 1's was 54%. In 2016-2017 the Level 1's was 54%.   -The teachers need to better align curriculum and daily lesson plans to the CCLS.   -Teachers need to better use data to drive instruction.   -Teachers need to better provide rigorous instruction for their students through questioning and discussions.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   Goal #1       By June of 2019, student writing will align to the Common Core State Standards as a result of the implementation of the  Teachers College Reading and Writing Program and teacher professional development. The number of students on  grade 5 achieving a level 3 and above will increase by 10% as measured by the 2019 NY State ELA assessment.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           19   Key Personnel  Who is responsible  for implementing  and overseeing the  activity/strategy?

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  ● A representative from P.S. 47 attends all of the DOE hiring halls. The DOE’s New Teacher finder has also been used  to hire new teachers as well. All of these candidates have been approved and certified.   ● At P.S. 47 we are able to retain teacher through our Associate Model. This model allows the school to pair “new  teachers” with “seasoned” teachers for a large portion of the day. The Associate Model is also “built in” professional  development.   Teachers enjoy working with a partner and look forward to coming to work each day.   ● Our Mentor Program is for all new teachers in their first few years. All Mentors are trained by The New Teacher  Center. This is a grant that District 12 received. Each new teacher is matched up to a mentor who will support their  instructional needs.   ● There are five coaches: two Literacy Coaches, two Math Coaches and a Universal Literacy Coach for teachers in  grades k-2, to provide one on one support for all teachers.   ● Each teacher receives professional development two times a month with an academic focus. There is a full day  professional development day in November and June.   ● Outside Consultants also provide support for teachers: CEI, Literacy Support and Generation Ready. This year P.S. 47  has become an official Teachers College school. Lead teachers will receive professional development at Teachers  College and turnkey back at the school. Consultants will also provide professional development at the school.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Aside from the school-wide professional development, all staff members are encouraged to attend professional  development sessions outside of the school. P.S. 47 is affiliated with Network 608. Network 608 provides ongoing  support and workshops that are tailored for all staff members to meet the CCSS needs of students. All of the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      workshops that Network 608 provides are instructional. The workshops are for Principals, Assistant Principals,  Coaches, teachers and paraprofessionals. P.S. 47 also has a partnership with BETLA and Fordham University to provide  workshops for our ESL (English as a second language) and Bilingual Teachers. This year the teachers are attending  citywide professional development for the new literacy and math curriculum. The school has been setting up teams to  attend the citywide professional development.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  In order to transition the pre-k students to P.S. 47, we provide an “Open House” for parents to get to know the  school.   During that open house parents receive information of what is expected of their children when they enter  kindergarten.   There is also on-going support throughout the kindergarten year for students who are not meeting the standards.  There are pull-out academic intervention services where students are learning “letter sound recognition” and  “decoding.” There is a school website that parents can log onto that will give them a brief overview of P.S. 47.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Every Monday teachers meet in their “Teacher Teams.” During that time teachers discuss assessment and the needs  of the students. There is also a monthly “Literacy Leads” meeting where the literacy curriculum and assessment are  discussed. Additionally, there is a monthly “Math Minds” meeting where math curriculum and math assessment is  discussed.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49         Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50     to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 47 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to  keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their  children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I  Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 47 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53      ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Assessment to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs in English.  The data provides  independent and reading instructional levels as well as fluency and comprehension.  The data is then used for grouping,  instructional planning, and response to intervention (RTI).  This data will help drive our school's instructional plan by  identifying the students that are most in need of additional language services.  Our school also uses several benchmarks  throughout the year to assess progress in the development of written English language.               2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      There are currently 2 Literacy Coaches for the upper and lower grades as well as 2 Math coaches.  On every grade there is an ENL/Common Branch teacher that is in 2 classes for half the day.  The ENL teachers work with the ENL Coordinator to program students according to their instructional levels.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate our success of our ELL programs by comparing our state exam scores school wide with other monolingual  classrooms as well as comparing our state scores with other schools in our district. We also look at monthly assessments  school wide and compare our ELLs to monolingual classes on the same grade to ensure grade level progress.  We use the  NYSESLAT results to measure growth from year to year for individual students and grades to help with instructional and  material decisions. Our team also takes a look analyzes student writing on summative writing performance tasks to determine  if strategies implemented are having a value added impact on student outcomes.  Finally, we also analyze individual student  quarterly reading assessments in grades 3-5 to determine whether students are achieving consistently toward our common  core implemented curriculum and if students are performing to those standards.  If they are not, the ELL team discuss  strategies that can be utilized to increase student performance in those areas.  As a whole, our ELLs tend to outperform most  of the district and as a result we believe our programs are very successful.                  4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are currently 2 Literacy Coaches for the upper and lower grades as well as 2 Math coaches.  On every grade there is an ENL/Common Branch teacher that is in 2 classes for half the day.  The ENL teachers work with the ENL Coordinator to program students according to their instructional levels.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data to guide instruction of ELLs within the RtI framework by using common core instructional materials that  offer tier 2 and 3 interventions as well as extended concepts for those not at-risk.  Our ENL/Bilingual teachers collect data on  individual students through conferencing and individual assessments during reading, math, and writing. Teachers assess  student results to understand what instruction has been provided and what the next steps should be. This data is used to  create flexible grouping to help provide our ELLs with the appropriate intervention. Our Literacy program, TC Writing, TC  Reading Workshop program(beginning September 2018) and Math program- GO Math!, are aligned to the Common Core  Standards to provide all ELLs high-quality learning opportunities. Grade level teacher teams meet weekly to identify areas  where students are struggling and together formulate monthly goals to guide instruction. During meetings teachers share  data, think objectively about struggling students, and discuss the quality of instruction in each tier. Student work is analyzed  during this time along with assessment results.       Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs through the following methods:  - small group instruction  - ENL scaffolds  - Associate Teachers (a second teacher in the class for additional support during literacy)  - Use of technology for individualized instruction through the use of the iReady program  - Extended Day and Saturday Programs for ELLs  - Provided researched based professional development for teachers   - We have fully credential Bilingual and ENL teachers.   - We have built-in professional development through the Associate Model.    -Generation Ready Bilingual/ELL Consultant         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67         The NYSITELL Scores for testing this year has been the following for grades K-5.  Total number of students tested using  NYSITELL was 71.  The breakdown of the scores are as follows:  K:, 1: 7; 2: 2, 3:2, 4:1, 5:2.  The majority of the students that  took the NYSITELL in Kindergarten were in the advanced levels of the LAB-R (26); 15 scored in the intermediate level; 18 scored  within the beginner level. The bulk of the students tested on the LAB-R is in kindergarten and the majority of those tested are  eligible to receive ENL services.   The data reveals that the majority of our ELL's are classified in the Advance Levels of the  NYSESLAT exam consistently after two years of ELL services both through transitional Bilingual programs and ENL freestanding  programs.  Most of the Advanced level students are reaching those milestones within grades K-2 therefore entering into  grades 3-5 with higher English understanding.  Overall, students are progressing and achieving those advanced levels and  proficient levels on the NYSESLAT.  There is however, a disparity between achieving the advanced level scores and the ELA  exam.  Most, of the students in grades 3 and 4 achieved a level 1 on the ELA exam but it was comparable to their monolingual  counterparts taking the same test.  Students in grades 3, 4 achieved levels 1 and 2 on the Math Exam (Native Language Math  was not available in these areas to assess).  There is a higher percentage of ELL's scoring levels 2 in grade 3 as opposed to their  counterparts (mathematics) this may be due to the Transitional Bilingual Program that works with students in both languages  and facilitates the process by which students choose the language that they will be tested in.   Note that the Science Exam also  shows that ELL's perform higher achieving levels 3 and 4 at about 50% rate.                   7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   There are currently 2 Literacy Coaches for the upper and lower grades as well as 2 Math coaches.  On every grade there is an ENL/Common Branch teacher that is in 2 classes for half the day.  The ENL teachers work with the ENL Coordinator to program students according to their instructional levels.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL instruction is delivered through four separate models in all grades, except 5th which is departmentalized: Self- contained ENL, Transitional Bilingual, pull-out ENL, and push-in ENL. In the ENL and Bilingual classrooms, students are  grouped heterogeneously by grade. The push-in and pull-out model is per grade. All ENL self-contained and bilingual  classrooms are heterogeneous. The 5th grade is departmentalized, but the ELLs are heterogeneously placed in one  section that travel together as a group to a certified ENL teacher for ENL & ELA and supporting teachers for content  areas.    In the TBE classroom, Math and Science are taught in the home language according the proficiency levels of the class.  HLA is taught everyday, as a subject, during a 45 minute block.           ENL/ Bilingual and Common Branch teachers who holds both certifications teach integrated ENL.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     In grades K-3 students are placed heterogeneously.   c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All classroom teachers and ENL teachers submit their schedules to the ENL supervisor to make sure that each student is  provided with the mandated amount of ENL, ELA, and NLA instruction time. Beginners and Intermediate students are in the  ENL and Bilingual classrooms and receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. The Advanced students are in pull-out and  push-in programs and receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.         Transitional Bilingual Education Program  a.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In ENL self-contained classrooms, Science, Math, and Social Studies are all taught in English using ENL strategies for support.  All content areas are taught through leveled and differentiated instruction.

Children taught in ENL classrooms  receive native language support through visuals, dictionaries, translation apps on iPads or Mac-Books. Teachers use translation  apps, readers in multiple languages, translation games, and instruction through a bilingual ENL or Bilingual teacher when  available.        In our Bilingual Transitional classrooms math, science, and social studies are taught in both English and Spanish. Our school  follows the transitional bilingual model, which starts at first with 75% instruction in Spanish and 25% instruction in English. We  then transition to 50% instruction in Spanish and 50% instruction in English. Finally, we transition to 25% instruction in Spanish  and 75% instruction in English. All Bilingual classrooms have all materials in both English and Spanish for all content areas,  including math, science and social studies.                     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language through the Spanish Lab and the assessment program El Sol.                 5.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a). We currently have two SIFE students in the fifth grade in our school. Some of the services that our SIFEs receive are: the  associate model, adopt an at-risk student; extended time services, after-school/Saturday programs, and AIS.  ENL additional services.  b.) Our ELLs who are newcomers to the country receive special attention and support during the beginning stages of their  entry. Newcomers are invited to participate in all extracurricular activities, like extended day, after-school, and Saturday  school. Newcomers are also given extra support through the Associate model during literacy. All of our Bilingual and ENL  teachers are extremely sensitive to the hardships newcomers endure during the beginning stages of their language acquisition.  Our teaching staff provides a nurturing and safe environment for all students. Some strategies that classroom teachers use are  to pair the student with another student who speaks the newcomer's language or to have the student write in his or her native  language and have others verbally translate their responses in the beginning stages. This year, we also have iPads that our  upper grade newcomers have constant access to. We have downloaded verbal translation apps to help our newcomers create  written and verbal English responses.   c. We provide ELL students receiving 4-6 years of services, with the same academic rigor as our general education students,  but with additional supports from an ENL/Common Branch teacher. In addition, they are invited to our Title III ENL Saturday  classes targeted just for ELLs with continued difficulties developing English Proficiency. This Saturday program provides  targeted support for ELLs struggling with language acquisition through phonics programs, vocabulary development and  opportunities to practice verbal and written English.   d.) Our long term Ells are grouped with our ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years of services. Our Saturday program was created  specifically for this subgroup. Through small group instruction and individualized lessons based on each student's specific  need, we hope to prepare our **** current long term ELLs to pass the NYSESLAT and gain English proficiency. Each teacher  who works with a long term ELL was made aware of the student's situation. These students have been selected to receive  extra support through the data inquiry team. In addition, each one of our long term ELLs receives academic intervention in  both reading and math.   e.) Former ELLs are transitioned into general education classes after reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT. They are then  greatly supported in their continued language development through our associate model and through ENL strategies that have  been given to Common Branch teachers. If needed, our former ELL can get support from one of our ENL or Bilingual teachers.  We also have an immigrant program on Saturdays that they are welcomed to attend.  For at least two years following the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70      school year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLs receive at least one half of one unit of study of English as  a new language (90 minutes per week) and are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations.     Testing Accommodations           ELLs are entitled to using those accommodations for most assessments, including those that are teacher-made and State- mandated. ELLs are not entitled to ELL testing accommodations on the NYSESLAT.      •     Time extension (all exams): Schools may extend the test time for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments  and on Regents examinations. Principals may use any reasonable extensions, such as "time and a half" (the required testing  time plus half that amount), in accordance with their best judgment about the needs of the ELL students. Principals should  consult with the student's classroom teacher in making these determinations. However, there are no time limits.    •     Separate location (all exams): Schools are encouraged to provide optimal testing environments and facilities for ELL  students. NYS assessments may be administered to ELLs individually or in small groups in a separate location.    •     Third reading of listening selection (English Language Arts exams only): Proctors may read the listening passage three  times to ELLs on grades 3-8 English Language Arts assessments and on the Regents Comprehensive Examination in English.    •     Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries: ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects  except languages other than English exams (LOTE). The bilingual dictionaries and glossaries may provide only direct one-to-one  translations of words. Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries that provide definitions or explanations are not permitted.  Bilingual glossaries in the content areas are available for downloading.    •     Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. For  state examinations for which SED provides written translations, ELLs may use both English and an alternative language edition  of the test simultaneously. However, they should be instructed to record all of their responses in only one language. The  alternative language edition used by the student should be so indicated on the student's answer sheet.    •     Oral translations for low incidence languages are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. Schools may provide  ELL students with an oral translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED. All  translations must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No clarifications or  explanations may be provided. Translators should receive copies of the English edition of the tests one hour prior to  administration.    •     Writing responses in the home language are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. ELL students making use  of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended  question in their home languages. Scoring the tests is the responsibility of the school.             6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs are provided with the standard general education grade-level material. Teachers then support the  students using different ENL strategies to increase content and language development. Some of the strategies used are visual  aids, manipulatives, smart-boards for visual and hands-on approaches, and small group instruction. To ensure that all ELL- SWDs not Freestanding ENL or Transitional Bilingual classrooms receive all services mandated on their IEP, the SPED  supervisor, Mr. Peay, and our ELL supervisor, Mr. Pimentel contact the appropriate grade level ENL/Bilingual teacher. The  teacher will call in the mandated attendence for each ELL-SWD they will service during their 90 minute literacy block  daily.                   7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The majority of our language learners in special education are in the general education classrooms and are pulled out for  related services. These students being part of the general education classroom, allows ENL students with special needs to have  the maximum times spent with their general education peers, in turn exposes them to grade appropriate materials and  behavior. However, some of our special education students are in Self-Contained classrooms or Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT)       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      based on their individual education plan (IEP). If a student is entitled to ENL, the child receives these services regardless of  their classroom placement. Our ENL teachers serve the students in both the ENL self-contained classrooms and also pull-out  students from Special Education self-contained classrooms. This ensures that the students are receiving the best support and  specially tailored differentiated instruction in the least restrictive environment.   The Integrated Co-Teaching Teachers implement differentiated instruction based on the needs of these students on a daily  basis. These teachers use the students' data (from test scores, classroom activities, monthly assessments, teacher observations  and teacher-student conferencing) both to modify the instruction according to the students' learning styles and academic  needs, implement academic intervention and enrichment, when necessary. These practices are shared and lessons are  designed in conjunction with the ENL supervisor, who makes sure all mandated hours are met.  In addition, teachers of special  needs students and teachers of ELLS come together as part of a teacher team on every grade. These teachers meet a few times  every month to discuss curriculum, student progress, share lesson plans, instructional ideas and plan curriculum to best  benefit the needs of these particular students.                    8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs are: AIS in ELA; AIS in Math; After-school program; and Saturday program for At-Risk ELLs  and Newcomers.   ELA: Literacy Intervention: Tier I intervention is scheduled for five 90 minutes per week of differentiated instruction. The  effectiveness of Tier I is the use of Balanced Literacy through the Associate Model: two teachers provide daily small-group  instruction based on common-core aligned material in an inter-related block. During this time reading workshop, writing  workshop, and language-word study instruction is provided. Instructional decisions are based on flexible grouping, Common  Core Standards, assessments, progress monitoring, benchmarks, rubrics, and data analysis for each student. With two teachers  available for 90 minutes, LEP students are able to be given more attention and support in developing English Language  proficiency. All instruction is delivered in English with native support when needed for clarification. Tier II intervention is built  into the Literacy program, allowing teachers to support ELLs in small groups with ENL strategies and strategic supports for  deeper understanding of concepts.   Tier III instruction: Each grade uses this time to increase language development through guided reading. Some of the research- based programs used are: Scholastic Guided Reading, RazKids(online program), Rigby (ELLs program), Phonics for Reading, Soar  to Success, and Fundations. All of these programs serve to support LEP/ELL students in improving proficiency and developing  academic skills in literacy (phonics, comprehension, vocabulary, etc.)  Math: Lower grades have 60 minute math periods five times a week and the upper grades 4th and 5th have 90 minute periods  five times a week in English in ENL classes and Spanish/English in Bilingual classes. During this time, tier I and tier II response to  intervention groups are formed based on flexible grouping based on common core content. Language support is also  incorporated during this time for ELLs through visual or kinesthetic small groups. Additional interventions used are Soar to  Success Math, Go Math educational games, and Uptown Education (educational software) are used to drive data driven  instruction to build conceptual understanding and ensure mastery of skills; and assist in developing the ability to think critically  and solve problems based on common core standards.   Science: Tier I intervention is scheduled within the three 45 minute periods per week through differentiated instruction. The  instruction reflects a student centered, problem solving approach to science aligned to Common core standards, benchmarks,  assessments, data analysis, and rubrics. Content area guided reading is included 3 times a week. Tier II intervention is  implemented in small groups 2 times a week during the day with targeted differentiated instruction. Foss Kits, Uptown  Education, Delta Science Modules (grades 3-5), are tool-kits used for intervention and re-teaching strategies through  technology and hands-on activities designed to target instructional needs.  Social Studies: Tier I intervention is scheduled for three 45 minute periods per week of differentiated instruction aligned with  Common Core Standards, assessments, data analysis, progress monitoring, and rubrics. Content area guided reading is  included during this targeted instruction to drive comprehension. Small group instruction provides Tier II  intervention using  additional resources - texts, visuals, Uptown Education - to scaffold re-teaching and support comprehension and academic       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      vocabulary.                  9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our Programs will remain the same.                    10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Paste response to question here:        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs have access to our After-school and Saturday Academy. Saturday Academy, which is funded by Title III and our  Immigrant Title III budget, prepares our newcomers, beginners, and struggling language learners who are at-risk of becoming  long term ELLs. We are targeting students who have less than one year of ENL services, students who scored at the beginner  level on the NYSESLAT and students who have received more than three years of ENL services and are still struggling.   After-school programs target the same groups of ELLs. Third through Fifth grade meet 3 times a week after-school with no  more than 20 students per class and no less than 15. All instruction is given in English. The programs will prepare students for  the NYSESLAT and ELA by developing their English reading, speaking, writing, and listening skills.                     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All ENL and Bilingual classrooms, as well as general education classes, are equipped with Smart-boards. Through the use of  technology students are given access to visual aids, notebook and PowerPoint presentations, websites, and interactive learning  games. The Smart-boards provide visual aids to develop and support conceptual understanding in all content areas, whether in  English or their native language. Currently 32 iPads are used in the upper grades during Literacy period to help newcomers and  long term ELLs with interventions and enrichment. 3rd through 5th grade use Achieve 3000 as an additional intervention for  our ELLs.  We also have dictionaries and NYSESLAT preparation books.  Social Studies instructional material used is the Social  Studies New York City from Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt. Science instructional material comes from Foss Web, which allows for  interactive learning. Our Literacy instructional material is from Ready Gen for all grades, which has ELL scaffolding in each  lesson for vocabulary and comprehension development. Math instructional material, Go Math! is also from Houghton-Mifflin  Harcourt, which contains a scaffolding ENL strategies handbook for all classroom teachers. Go Math! is accessible through the  internet and Smart-board files to further interactive learning.                  13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered through content supplemental materials in our Transitional Bilingual classes.  Bilingual  textbooks, leveled readers , and workbooks are used to support our students in their native language. In our ENL classes,  native support is delivered by partner pairing and translation. Also, most of our ENL teachers are bilingual so students can  receive native language support through the teacher as well.                14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Teachers and our ELL supervisor make sure that all content, material, and support is age appropriate and on grade level. Each  student is places based on age in the appropriate grade and resources distributed are per grade.                  15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ENL and Bilingual classrooms, as well as general education classes, are equipped with Smart-boards. Through the use of  technology students are given access to visual aids, notebook and PowerPoint presentations, websites, and interactive learning  games. The Smart-boards provide visual aids to develop and support conceptual understanding in all content areas, whether in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73         English or their native language. Currently 32 iPads are used in the upper grades during Literacy period to help newcomers and  long term ELLs with interventions and enrichment. The 3rd through 5th grades use My On and RazKids as an additional  intervention for our ELLs.  We also have dictionaries and NYSESLAT preparation books.  Social Studies instructional material  used is the Social Studies New York City from Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt. Science instructional material comes from Foss Web,  which allows for interactive learning. Our Literacy instructional material is from ReadyGen for all grades, but will be switching  to Teachers College Reading Workshop next year.  There is ELL scaffolding in each lesson for vocabulary and comprehension  development. Math instructional material, Go Math! is also from Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt, which contains a scaffolding ENL  strategies handbook for all classroom teachers. Go Math! is accessible through the internet and Smart-board files to further  interactive learning.                  16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our ENL parents are a very close community. Our PTA and parent coordinator- Laura Smith, provide assistance in translation  and information about our school and community. We encourage parents of newcomers to read in their native language to  their child and provide them with instructional materials on how to prepare their child for the upcoming school year.                    17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to our student population. We do have offer Transitional Bilingual classes until 3rd  grade which offers instruction in English and Spanish. During the state assessments, students have the option of taking the  Mathematics and Science in their native language.                  18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development opportunities are offered through information provided by the office of Division of English Language  Learners and Student support.  The opportunities are shared with the ELL and bilingual teachers and they can attend sessions  that are meaningful for our students and school community.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.      Throughout the year, ENL/Bilingual teachers receive numerous amounts of out of school professional development, which is  then turn keyed with the ENL/Bilingual team. This year, teachers are focusing on aligning content areas to common core  standards and the use of technology to drive instruction.  Some of the professional developments attended this year are:  How       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74         to Use Achieve 3000 as intervention; new ENL coordinator, RtI for ELLs. Teachers also use EngageNY.com to obtain videos  about Common Core Standards and data driven instruction.  This year our goal is for each ENL/Bilingual teacher to receive  three professional development courses outside of school that they will be able to turn key to all staff. The ENL/Bilingual  teachers also meet once a month to discuss best practices and share effective strategies. Teachers of ELLs are also receiving in- school professional development aligned with Common Core standards twice a month. Common branch teachers are also  invited to multiple workshops outside of school annually to learn more about ENL strategies. It is common that common  branch teachers in 3rd, 4th and 5th attend turn-key sessions and professional development.    Our 5th grade ENL staff receives annual training on how to assist parents in filling out the middle school choice forms. We are  also visited by multiple middle schools to discuss how to best prepare elementary students for middle school. Each year,  students have the opportunity to meet with advisors from numerous middle schools during 5th grade assemblies.   Each year our ELL supervisor, with assistance from ESL teachers, hold multiple professional development sessions on how to  properly identify and support ELLs in their classroom. Sessions provide teachers with ESL strategies, how enrich vocabulary,  and how to effectively differentiate instruction for all learners. Every teacher attends these sessions. Attendance is taken and  recorded by the ELL supervisor. Both the agendas and attendance are kept in our school PD binder each year.   This years current PD schedule is as follows:  November 21st - Danielson 1a-Demonstrating Knowledge of Content - Literacy Coach Vitolo & Coach Gertelman  November 26th - Danielson 1a Demonstrating Knowledge of Content & 3c Engaging Students in Learning - Go Math  Smartboard            K - Ms. Rossini & Ms. Perez ; 1st Ms. Sjogren (w/Ell Strategies); 2nd Ms. Carrick; 3rd Ms Greenstein (SWD); 4th Ms.  Russon(SWD); 5th Ms.LoPiccolo  December 11th - Danielson 1d Demonstrating Knowledge of Resources - Social Studies Mr. Laverty  December 19th - Danielson 3b - Questioning & Discussion - Go Math!

Our Ell teachers will also attend outside professional developments for New Ell Coordinators, TC Writing Workshop  series, ReadyGen NYC Philosophy, Priorities and Progression for Teachers, Go Math!, Individualized Smart-board training in- house by TEQ for K through 2 teachers, Brain Power and Restorative Circles to help our students emotionally in the classroom.                          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our ELL parents are extremely active in our school community. They attend our EPIC workshops, come to our ENL and Bilingual  classrooms to assist in native instruction (read-alouds and sharing in cultural activities.) Our parents participate in sharing  multi-cultural classroom events and holidays. Parent volunteers assist our teachers on field trips. Translation services are  provided if necessary by one of our Bilingual teachers or assigned pedagogues listed in Part IV, 1. If in-school translation  services are not available the over-the-phone interpretation services, 718-752-7373, will be called to assist our parents in their  native language. When known in advance of a native language our assigned pedagogues do not speak, on-site interpretation  can be requested by completing a Interpretation Request Form and emailing it to the translation office.  If workshop  documents need translation and our assigned team is unable to assist we would reach out in advance of the workshop to the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75            document translation services provided by the Department of Education. We have a partnership with EPIC (Every Person  Influences Children). EPIC provides workshops in mulitiple languages which address how parents can help support their  children's education. There are a total of ten workshops which cover topics like: "How to use TV wisely"," How to be the best  parent", and "How to ensure your child's success in school." Translation services are provided if necessary by one of our  Bilingual teachers or assigned pedagogues listed in Part IV, 1. If in-school translation services are not available the over-the- phone interpretation services, 718-752-7373, will be called to assist our parents in their native language. When known in  advance of a native language our assigned pedagogues do not speak, on-site interperation can be requested by completing a  Interpretation Request Form and emailing it to the translation office.  If workshop documents need translation and our  assigned team is unable to assist we would reach out in advance of the workshop to the document translation services  provided by the Department of Education.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parents and all parents are invited to come celebrate cultural celebrations in the classroom as well as cultural days.  They  are also invited to come each Tuesday to engage in their child's learning.  Parents are invited to library events, TC writing  celebrations on each grade and to attend trips to experience and make memories with their children.                 Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN: 12X047  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We assess our schools written translation and oral interpretation needs through our translation team surveying  the community and analyzing the HLIS and Parent Language Codes in ATS. In the beginning of the year, through  our various Grade Open House parent meetings, we let all parents know that we have a translation team. Within  30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment (or, for students already enrolled, by a date and procedure to be  determined by the Office of Teaching and Learning) the primary language spoken by the parent of each student  enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English, whether the parent requires language assistance in  order to communicate effectively with the Department.   At any point during upcoming parent meetings, parent/teacher conferences and/or notices going home we will  provide the necessary assistance to accommodate interpretation needs. All staff members are provided  information on the Translation Policy and the New York City Translation phone number, which will translate       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79      messages in any language as needed. We have a staff of three pedagogues and two paraprofessionals who edit,  discuss, and work together to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information. We  collaborate closely with our PTA President and our Parent Coordinator to ensure that all parental translation  needs are being addressed. The Translation team meets monthly or as needed to develop school wide language  access initiatives. In addition, parents and their students that are new to our schools, complete the Home  Language Identification Survey where they indicate their preferred langauge. This information is also found in ATS,  and on emergency cards, along with all other parents at our schools. This information is used to communicate  with the parents using their preferred language. Our IEP students' parents are asked their preferred language of  communication during the initial evaluation meeting and annual meetings.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Our  Asian student population, which includes  our Arabic and Bengali speaking students  has increased from 7% to 9%. At the  beginning of the year, home surveys are  distributed to parents. When receiving  these surveys back at the school we are  able to determine and accommodate all  parents with written communication in  their language of preference. We  communicated these findings to our  school community through our Grade  Open House parent meetings. Our  translation team reported the survey  findings to the school administration,  office staff and teachers.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Currently, our translation team consists of staff members with  various backgrounds in Spanish, French, Arabic and Benagli. Our team  provides oral and written translation as needed. Staff members are  paid per session on an as needed basis for their translation services.  To accommodate our school community our team is tasked to  translate all written documents by the next school day. This will allow  our secretarial staff to save the documents on file for future  references and to dissiminate information to the school community  in a timely fashion. Parents will receive written documents in the  language they specified on their home language survey. Also, parents  can also request communication in two languages. All translation  services will be provided in-school and not by an outside vendor.    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   plan to   Families    translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.    September-June   Staff will be   paid per  session for  translation.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In addition to the office staff having access to the parent's information, the parent coordinator is also instrumental in  communicating with parents. The parent coordinator will contact the office of translation and interpretation to send  emergency communication to families as needed.    There are other staff in the building, including school aides that serve as translators and have relationships with many  of our families.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.         Our school provides each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance  services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation  and interpretation services.     Our school posts in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to the school a sign in each of the covered  languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services.       Our school’s safety plan consists of procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. In the event that we  have parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a primary language that is neither English nor a  covered language, we shall obtain from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language of  the signage and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in accordance with  this section.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services through a parent survey made  available to parents in their preferred language, during the fall parent meetings, and in the spring parent meeting. The  survey will also be made available on our school's website in all of the covered languages.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83
