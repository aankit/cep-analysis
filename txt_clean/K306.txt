The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   The Ethan Allen School, 19K306, services grades Pre-K - 5, with 280 students. Our school population consists of 74%  Black, 24% Hispanic, 2% Indian. 2% of our students are English Language Learners and 30% are students with special  needs. Approximately 75 (15%) of our students live in temporary housing.    The school community, recognizes that our scholars, including ELL’s (English Language Learners) and SWD’s (Students  with Disabilities), are dynamic with diverse learning styles, needs, readiness and interests. The school strives to  provide each student with a standards-based education that promotes critical thinking, self-confidence and  motivation resulting in academic achievement and social/emotional growth.    The school's mission/vision is to provide a challenging and inclusive educational curriculum with an embedded focus  on social and emotional learning, rigorous literacy instruction and STEM, in order to equip all scholars with 21st  Century skills to be successful and productive beyond our school and into their careers. We aim to maximize  individual potential, through our core belief and ensure all scholars are empowered to meet the challenges of  education. We strive for a culture of collaboration and respect for individual differences.   The school believes students learn best, when they are provided with instructional tiered support, specific actionable  next steps and multiple opportunities for critical thinking where they make their thinking visible through discussion  and writing.   To ensure the school has an effective home-school connection component, the school has partnered with Scholastics  to promote the school's comprehensive initiative. Scholastics Parent Literacy Events, will provide families literature  and literacy strategies to parents so they can support their child with reading and writing. The program will be led by  parent leaders, parent coordinator and teachers. This opportunity allows coherence across our school in regards to  the school instructional focus, which is ensuring all students are "making their thinking visible in writing".   In order to support our teachers, staff, students, and parents, the school has partnered with CAMBA (CBO), who will  provide support in improving the school's attendance, family engagement and mental health services. The school will  also partner with the BNFSC, Guidance Manager and De-escalation Unit to support the school in meeting the needs of  student’s social and emotional growth.    As a Renewal School, we will continue the implementation of the following school improvement strategies during this  school year; our Expanded Learning Time will provide students the opportunity to engage in literacy strategies across  the content areas of Social Studies and Science and increased instructional support integrating individualized literacy  and math instruction and support with technology by implementing the IReady platform for all students. . In addition  to meeting the individual needs of our students, our ELT program has an academic tutorial and enrichment  component, ensuring all students are engaged in rigorous learning activities.             2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 19K306   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   329   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

(Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice   Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed               X   X   Part 1b.

Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.  Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Our Quality Review 2018 indicated the following areas that our school does well:     Unit and lesson plans demonstrate alignment to the Common Core standards, in all content areas, as well as   addressing the speaking and listening standard, to promote college readiness for all students.     Unit and lesson plans include opportunities for students to engage in questioning and discussion across all   content areas.     Across all grades and subjects, teachers use a common unit planning template that includes attention to   essential questions, standards, content areas of focus and foundational standards. Thus, this practice supports  our school in building coherence across grades and subjects.   Our needs are based on the DTSDE tenet recommendation for SOP 3.3 and Quality Review 2018. In order for our school  to move to a Well Developed rating, we must deepen and extend teachers' collaborations across grades to develop CCLS  lesson and unit plans to include Universal Design of Learning (UDL). Unit and lesson plans will include instructional tiers  to ensure all learners including SWDs and ELLs have access to their learning. Teachers will continue to develop scaffolds,  identify and utilize rigorous materials, and analyze student work and rubrics to consistently monitor and adjust  lessons/curricular to ensure the individual needs of students are being addressed, leading to improved student  outcomes.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Our school's instructional focus:   Scholars will deepen their knowledge and understanding by engaging in tiered instruction that supports all learners in  making thinking visible through writing across all content areas.         What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   Our school's vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of our diverse learners are:      Lesson planning reflects teachers' understanding of diverse student's linguistic differences and other needs and  available resources, including technology, resulting in a series of learning activities that engage students in high- level cognitive activity. Lesson and unit structures allow for different pathways to understanding according to  diverse student needs.     Curricula and academic tasks include appropriate scaffolds and differentiated strategies to engage students,   advance them through the content, and assess their understanding as evidenced by their work products.     Teachers across grades and subjects use student work, data and the progression of learning to plan and refine  curricula and academic tasks in order to cognitively engage all students, including lowest and highest achieving  students.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  Our school's vision is to ensure we are integrating the instructional shifts by making purposeful connections between  the shifts and the topics in each subject, within a grade and as students advance through the grades, so as to promote  college and career readiness. Scholars will engage in rigorous habits and higher order skills, such as those that require  them to create their own meaning, integrate skills into processes, and use what they have learned to solve real world  problems-are identified, defined and embedded within curricula and academic tasks coherently across grades and  subjects.          What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   To ensure that all students are set up for success, we envision instruction to look like:     Across classrooms, teachers strategically use scaffolds, questioning, opportunities for choice and other best   teaching practices to create a variety of strategies for students to access the content or task, be supported in  learning or extend it to different possible endpoints, so all students show mastery of the learning objectives and  corresponding standards.     Teacher monitoring of student understanding during lessons is visibly active and continuous, the teacher is   constantly taking the pulse of the class and making frequent use of strategies such as cold calling, questioning  for explanation, stop-and-jot prompts, a real-time student response technology to elicit information about  individual student understanding and trends, resulting in purposeful, in the moment adjustments to instruction.   Students consistently self- or peer-assess against assessment criteria and monitor their own understanding and  progress. As a result students are able to articulate their next learning steps.             How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          16      Using summative and formative assessments, teachers planning and preparation will include scaffolds and  differentiated learning tasks that meet the individual needs of all learners. Multiple entry points may include:      Narrative: Students learn through writing;    Aesthetic: Students learn through visuals and audio;        Experiential: Students learn through hands on activities.   Logical/Quantitative: Students learn through deductive reasoning or computation;  Foundation: Students learn by responding to broader concepts or ideas and         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Our vision for a comprehensive assessment strategy includes:     Teachers, individually or as a part of collaborative teams, effectively analyze assessment data to glean   information about students performance and learning needs relative to the learning goals. Teachers will then  accurately identify specific instructional responses to the data, which might include re-teaching content,  changing instructional approaches to meet the needs of all students, and developing more challenging tasks or  units of study. Adjustments to lessons and tasks are effective and teachers can produce evidence of the impact  of their instructional responses on student progress.      Teachers monitoring of student understanding during lessons is visibly active and continuous the teacher is   constantly taking the pulse of the class and making frequent use of strategies such as cold calling, questioning  for explanation, stop-and-jot prompts, and real-time student response technology to elicit information about  individual student understanding and trends resulting in purposeful, in the moment adjustments to instruction.   Students consistently self/peer assess against assessment criteria and monitor their own understanding and  progress. As a result, they are able to articulate their next learning steps.                Please indicate below the specific assessments that you are implementing and their purpose for each grade.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Our Quality Review 2018 indicated the following areas that our school does well:     A teacher from each grade serves on the school's instructional cabinet alongside administrators, and they meet   regularly to assess the work of teacher teams, design professional learning, use of assessments and their  alignment to curricula, ensuring that teachers have a voice in key decisions that affect student learning across  the school.      Majority of teachers are engaged in inquiry aligned to the school's goals, focused on improving student learning      in writing and math.   Several Teachers in the school have formal leadership roles providing mentoring and professional learning for  other staff members on professional responsibilities and instructional best practices for serving students with  disabilities. The work of the teacher leaders and targeted professional learning helps to build coherence in  instructional strategies across classrooms and create consistency for students, of instructional strategies across  the grades.    Our needs are based on the DTSDE tenet recommendation for SOP 4 and Quality Review 2018. In order for our school to  move to a Well Developed rating, teachers must be systematic in working with students to develop goals and support  them towards mastery of goals connected to student's strengths. Teachers must use the cycles of inquiry to track the  same group of students and collect the data within the cycle to analysis and support students.       2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          26      School leaders and instructional leadership team should develop a plan and time line to provide teachers with a  compendium/menu of strategies and tools that they can used to adjust teacher practice and create strategic goals for  groups of students that fosters improved outcomes for all learners.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     To organize teachers in vertically aligned teams by grade band (K &1; 2 & 3; 4 & 5) to engage in 3 cycles of inquiry using  the Data Wise Improvement Process which is an eight-step model that guides teams in working collaboratively to  improve teaching and learning through evidence-based analysis. Our goal in building a system of teams is to have a  cohesive instructional guidance system, in which the curriculum, study materials, pedagogical strategies, and  assessments are coordinated within and across grades with meaningful teacher input.            How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  Teachers will be able to see the continuum of learning needed across all grade level to support mastery by all diverse  learners in the school. The cabinet with use the standards to develop a shared understanding of connection between  teacher practice and student outcomes of mastery as they draft units of study that allows all students to grow towards  grade level independent habits. Build a strong system of teams that honors collaborative work by creating time to meet,  listening to input, and providing support. Additionally, the teams identifies data to analyze, creates data overview for  staff, listens to input, and provides supports. Teaches work collaboratively to ensure consistency in instructional  practice including analyzing student data.         How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teachers will adapt the habits of mind which includes a shared commitment to action, assessment and adjustment,  intentional collaboration, and a relentless focus on evidence that underlies the work. Teachers will engage in cycles of  inter-visitation and feedback within the grade bands using the data from teacher practice (lesson planning, low  inference notes from teaching and learning, etc.) as well as students’ work product to make adjustments to instructional  practice aimed at meeting the needs of diverse learners. Teachers will develop a shared language of understanding of  teaching to students’ strengths as they provide them with effective tools towards building independence in mastering  grade level standards. The teams will use student work and data to inform their decisions by administering assessments  that support the skill or standard of focus, scoring it against an agreed upon rubric or checklist and then using the  student work/data to surfacing noticing and wondering during the meetings. They then use the noticing and wondering  to make a teaching decision as to the next steps that they will collective take to support students at each level of  performance.         How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teachers will have a shared understanding of the standards as it relates to the expected student outcome across each  grade band allowing them to provide students with the necessary scaffolds essential to mastery of the content.  Teachers use the shared understanding to provide students with an instructional strategy that they can use to build  independence and understanding as they engage in a cycle of teaching and learning that requires an in depth look at  data sources to support students has they interact with the curriculum at their individual/independent level. Teachers  will be able to plan for student misconceptions and prior knowledge ensuring that students are supported throughout  the lesson and unit.

Our Quality Review 2018 indicated the following areas that our school does well:     Teachers ensure school-wide assessment practices that consistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for   understanding and actionable feedback to improve student outcomes.     Teachers maintain classroom data binders which include formative/summative assessments and student work   products which are used to monitor progress.   Our needs are based on the DTSDE tenet recommendation for SOP 2.5 and the Quality Review 2018. In order for our  school to move to a Well Develop rating, we must implement a system for monitoring teachers’ progress on the  evaluative component of 3d. Using Assessment in Instruction. We will have to strengthen teacher’s use of formative  assessments so that teachers make ongoing instructional adaptations and use assessments to inform small group  instruction on a consistent basis. Consider providing additional professional learning opportunities for selected teachers  to support them on utilizing daily assessment results to provide differentiation of instruction.

These tools are  used by teachers and school leaders to track progress towards goals across grades and subject areas and make  instructional decisions.     Teacher teams agree on learning goals and benchmark performances for units, tasks, and courses prior to   designing or using formative assessments to measure student mastery of the goals.     Teachers, individually or as part of collaborative teams, effectively analyze assessment data to glean information  about students’ performance and learning needs relative to the learning goals. Teacher then accurately identify  specific instructional responses to the data, which might include re-teaching content, changing instructional  approaches to meet the needs of all students, and developing more challenging tasks or units of study.  Adjustments to lessons and tasks are effective and teachers can produce evidence of the impact of their  instructional responses on student progress.           On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Our school will ensure there are transparent structures in place for the quality of assessments to be reviewed by school  leaders and faculty to ensure that they are effectively gauging student understanding and ability given the Common  Core learning standards, promotion criteria, and other college and career readiness expectations. Observation feedback  from supervisors, and supportive feedback from coaches and colleagues results in adjustments to instructional practices  across classrooms that are coherent and embody a shared approach to teaching and learning.         What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   Our school will establish a consistent process by which instructional planning documents are vetted and revised, based  on clear and coherent curricular expectations. This work may be purposefully embedded in teacher team meetings,  collaborative planning meetings, supervisory structure, or other means.           What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Distributive leadership structures will be rooted in the school’s day-to-day operations. Teacher leaders including team  leaders, coaches, mentors, cabinet members, literacy and math instructional teacher leaders, or department chairs will  be essential to the decision making process regarding policies and /or programs that affect student achievement.    Teacher teams will effectively implement systems to monitor a variety of student data and classroom practices that  inform instruction leading to the mastery of goals for groups of students.         How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  Our school will foster full family participation by staff members providing ongoing, clear lines of verbal and written  communication to families about promotion, graduation, and college and career readiness.

WESNER - Following the Framework for Great Schools - Strong Family and Community ties, PS306 will create a  welcoming environment for families and take advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school.  Our SMART Goals will be met in partnership with our Community School Provider, and will include: Increased Family  Engagement; Hosting 5 high quality events which may include but not be limited to: Women Empower Forum,  Community Health Fair, Know Your Rights Workshops, Career Day, Back to School Event, Holiday Celebration, End of  Year Performance etc.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal:  Which Renewal and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks do you expect will improve by meeting your  Community School Program Annual Goal?   List of Renewal Benchmarks expected to improve   Supportive Environment will improve as evidenced by a 10% increase in teacher responses on the school survey.      - The dual goals of increased attendance and strong family and community ties can begin to be met by engaging parents  on many levels and encouraging them to access the PS306 school as a community center. PS306 will host informative  and engaging community events which will provide parents and community members with information and critical  resources. Community engagement through events will also allow parents to celebrate their children’s achievements in  skill mastery of extracurricular activities at PS306.    Strong Family Community Ties      -Many of the school’s challenges to attendance are around parents getting their children to the building. Parent  engagement is critical to student attendance. As parents begin to access PS306 as a community center and view the  school as supportive space they will be more likely to get their children to the building, which will in turn increase  school attendance.   Trust      -Finally, as parents become more comfortable with the supportive school environment, we will learn more about their  collective challenges and barriers to getting their children to school. In partnership with our Community School  Provider, we will identify parents with chronically absent children and assign them a Success Coach. The role of a  success coach is to identify the various family challenges to getting their children to school and helping them meet  those challenges.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  Employing four key principles the four key principles below the school will work to:  1) Establish Relationships (Link with children and families to form relationships before the first day of school and  continue to build upon these relationships throughout the Kindergarten year).   a. Provide opportunities for parents to visit a Kindergarten class with their child at the school they will attend the  following school year.   b. Pair Kindergarten support staff with preschool children to build bonds and assist families’ support and assistance as  transition needs arise.   c. Allow the Kindergarten teacher to interact directly with tentative children for next year’s Kindergarten class the  spring of the children’s Pre-K year by visiting their Pre-K class to read a story or lead an activity.   d. Make personal contact with families within the first few days of their child starting Kindergarten to ask how the  child did their first few days of school.  2) Promote Academics and Learning (Provide families with information that helps prepare children for the academic,  social, and emotional skills in Kindergarten).   a. Share school readiness information with parents throughout the year before children begin Kindergarten and  encourage parents to practice skills at home.   b. Disseminate home-learning calendars and activities that parents can do with their child over the summer months  prior to Kindergarten entry.   c. Introduce Kindergarten rules and rituals in Pre-K and childcare programs throughout the preschool year.   d. Incorporate past preschool activities into Kindergarten classes to provide continuity for children.  3) Provide Ongoing Communication (Create an open system of communication to inform families about all aspects of  the child’s school).   a. Provide families with written information in a language they can understand concerning need to know items such  as: picking up children, before and after school care, school supplies, school uniforms, school lunches, school  calendars, important phone numbers and school day hours the spring before Kindergarten begins.   b. Create newsletters and resource materials that provide families Kindergarten transition activities the year before  Kindergarten and throughout the Kindergarten year.   c. Hold family meetings with the child’s Kindergarten teacher to discuss expectations prior to the school year  beginning.   d. Hold information sessions that provide information to the parents of incoming students on screenings and services  available such as speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and other special education services.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          54      4) Offer Support (Establish a support network to help families navigate the process of entering a new school setting  before the 1st day of school and throughout the Kindergarten year).   a. Maintain periodic contact with Kindergarten families throughout the school year to address transition needs,  concerns as well as to help the family develop skills to navigate the educational system.   b. Hold parent-teacher conferences throughout the school year with Kindergarten families.   c. Encourage preschool teachers to visit or write letters to former students in the Kindergarten classroom during the  first month of school to ease the transition process.           4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The school has a MOSL Committee. The committee is comprised of eight (8) members of the school community. The  principal selects four members (either teachers or administrators) and the UFT chapter leader will select the other  four members. The committee is responsible for the following items:      □ Reflect on the successes and challenges associated with last year’s MOSL selections.   □ Review last year’s assessment results for evidence of growth and gaps across subject areas, grade levels, and  student groups.   □ Discuss your school’s instructional focus and how it relates to MOSL options.   □ Discuss school goals and structures for collaborative professional learning and how MOSL could be used to support  these goals.   □ Discuss how assessments used for MOSL will be integrated into your school’s strategic assessment plan, including  your periodic assessment selections.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          56        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school will support parents/families of Title I students by.   Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology.   Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children.   Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress.   Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments.   Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach,  communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of  the school community.               Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          59      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESEA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;            Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Parent Association/Parent Teacher Association (PA/PTA): PA/PTAs can support schools by raising funds, hosting  parent workshops or meetings, organizing festivals, dances or social events for families, and can help schools connect  with parents through updates and volunteer opportunities.   School Leadership Team (SLT): The School Leadership Team (SLT) provides a structure for school-based decision  making and the development of a collaborative school culture. The SLT members develop educational policies for  their school and align resources to those policies.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   SY 18-19  Beginning in September, all ELLs will receive their ENL Units of Study based on their NYSESLAT proficiency levels and in  accordance with the Units of Study as described in CR 154-2  *If the newly hired ENL teacher is dually certified the students may receive services in a pullout model for Stand  Alone ENL and Integrated ENL units of study  If the newly hired ENL teacher is not dually certified the ENL teacher will pushin to the ELA content classroom  to provide Integrated ENL services by co-teaching along with a subject area teacher.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Effective SY 18-19 contingent upon the hiring of a licensed ENL teacher, all students will receive the mandated minutes of ENL  instruction per week as per CR 154 based on proficiency levels from the NYSITELL/LAB-R and NYSESLAT scores. To ensure that  the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided, the ENL teacher will post a copy of her program schedule where it  is easily visible by school leadership. A copy of each student's schedule will be given to the classroom teacher and their  parents.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   SY 18-19  19K306 will provide a  freestanding ENL program which uses the pull-out/push-in model.  In the pull-out model, ELLs are  brought together from various classes for English-acquisition-focused instruction.  The ENL  teacher will plan carefully with  general education teachers to ensure curricular alignment.  In the push-in model, the ENL teacher will work with the teacher  of ELLs to plan on how to best provide language acquisition and vocabulary support aligned to the content lesson objective.  The programs are available for ELLs in all grades and at all levels:  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding.  The allotted time for ENL instruction is determined by the students’ English language proficiency  levels.  Thorough consideration to scheduling needs will be given to the ENL teacher, to allow Entering, Emerging and  Transitioning students to receive 360 minutes of instruction weekly (double periods/45 minutes each period, four times a  week), Expanding students receive 180 minutes per week (one period/45 minutes, four times a week) and Commanding  students receive 90 minutes of instruction per week. Students are grouped in heterogeneous groups. Instruction is  differentiated according to NYSESLAT score and grade level, as well as by individual student need as measured by writing   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          68      samples and general assessments taken on a regular basis.  Input is also sought from the students’ classroom teachers to  further tailor the class to students’ needs.    The focus of the program will be to increase academic English language and skills in an effort to aid students with their overall  academic work and preparation for the NYSESLAT and success in core subject classes. Content will be the focus of instruction,  but the primary objective of instruction will be to promote language learning through listening, speaking, reading and writing  in English.  In this Freestanding ENL program, language arts will be taught using ENL and ELA methodologies aligned with the  CCLS. All content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies and aligned with the CCLS.     Scaffolding and differentiated instruction will be based on student proficiency level and collaborative planning by classroom  and content teachers. Cooperative learning strategies will be used to make content comprehensible and to enrich language  development. Additionally, scaffolding, role playing, think-pair-share, making connections, buddy reading, choral reading, the  use of graphic organizers, levels of questioning, making, making inferences, listening, brainstorming, and various other  strategies. The teacher will continue to use a variety of instructional materials to support our ELLs.  Text will adapted to meet  each student's individual needs as needed. In addition, native language support, such as the use of bilingual dictionaries,  materials in the native language, and translation will be offered to all ELLs. A literacy approach will be aligned to the criteria of  the ELA class in most cases.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Home language support is provided as needed.  The school library, classroom teachers and parents of English Language  Learners in grades 3-5 each each have a set of bilingual glossaries. Classroom teachers also provide their students bilingual  glossaries in their native language for content area support: Science, Math, and Social Studies     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SY 18-19  19K306 will implement a Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) Program. The primary goal of the program will be to:    In the Freestanding ENL program we have students, from grades 3-5. They range from Emerging to Commanding proficiency  levels. Both the classroom teacher and ENL teacher will continue to collaborate to create a supportive environment that helps  our ELLs progress.  All English Language Learners will receive explicit instruction which includes:     The ENL teacher will collaborate with classroom teachers to address language needs of ELLs:    Instructional materials and manipulatives will support the curriculum of instruction and language needs of ELLs:  The following test prep materials will be used to prepare students for NYS assessments:     a. Plan for SIFE   There are no SIFE students currently enrolled at 19K306. In the event that a SIFE enrolls in our school, they will participate in  the ENL program. SIFE students are  provided with instructional support specifically designed to meet their particular  instructional needs, in the development of literacy skills and knowledge in academic content areas.    b. Plan for Newcomer ELLs  When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          69      •     An informal student orientation  •     Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the day  •     Encourage student to participate in the After School activities.  •     An informal assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs.   •     Home school communication  •     Bilingual glossaries in student's native language and bilingual dictionaries are supplied.  Based on the results of their NYSITELL /LAB-R assessments, newcomers to the English Language School System will receive  their mandated ENL services.  Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate needs to facilitate a smooth  transition.  In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them in groups with native  English language speakers as well as students who share the same first language as the newcomers.  Students will participate  in small group, task-oriented situations that guide the production of language both in verbal and written form.  Students’  seating arrangements will enable them to clearly see and hear the teacher during instruction.     c. Plan for Developing ELLs :  Both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher use scaffolding and realia.  With these approaches the students will develop  interpersonal communication skills (the connection between form and structure for English, and their social-functional  meaning; develop the ability to use language by actively employing the students’ information processing capabilities required  to acquire academic language skills that underline reading comprehension and other content areas; use language for a  functional purpose so that language acquisition emerges as a result of the need to communicate while performing academic  activities (the subject matter may be modified so that it is comprehensible to the ELL students).  •     The ENL Pull-out/Push-in program at 19K306 focuses on the following for all ELLs:    •     Academic rigor   •     The use of ENL methodologies and strategies during instruction   •     Alignment of all instruction with the Common Core State Standards and the New Language Arts Progressions (K-5)  •     The recruitment and retention of high quality teachers of English Language Learners.     d. Plan for Long Term ELLs  Long terms ELLs will be provided with additional reading and writing support and their progress will be monitored across  all content are  e. Plan for Former ELLs  •     Former ELLs will continue to receive all ELL testing accommodations and 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL in ELA or  Content area or other approved services.  •     Former ELLs will participate in the school’s supplemental ELL program if the activities would further benefit the language  development of the participating students.  •     Former ELLs will continue articulation and support with the newly hired ENL teacher.      6.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lenika Vane, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Ethan Allen                                                                              School DBN: 19K306  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
