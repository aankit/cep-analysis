This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement:   Section 4: CEP Overview      At Sunset Park Avenues, our entire community strives to ensure that all students experience an education that allows  for each unique individual to thrive in a global community - academically, socially, and emotionally. Learning through  a curriculum based in exploration and independent practice with the support of expert teachers, our students grow to  be curious about their world, think creatively and flexibly about problems and solutions, and have the confidence and  resilience to make things happen for themselves and their world. We celebrate and integrate the multi-lingual and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      multi-cultural heritage of our students, families, and neighborhood into our classrooms, and are working to prepare  our students to belong to and succeed in a global society.   In order to make our mission a reality, our school focuses on:   - Knowing the strengths and needs of each child well to provide a more responsive and individualized learning  experience   - Commitment to the workshop model in which students get lots of hands-on practice under the watchful eye of  teachers   - Building literacy, language, listening, and communication skills in all students    - Utilizing and developing native language skills to accelerate English and second language acquisition      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 516 is a new public elementary school that opened in September 2013 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. In the 2018-2019  school year, we will reach full scale and serve children in grades PK-5. In the 2018-2019 school year, P.S. 516 will  enroll approximately 540 students. Our student population is 77% Hispanic, 16% Asian, 8.5% White, and 0.5% Black.  49% of students are male and 51% are female. Over 50% of our students are English Language Learners and 85% of  our students have free and reduced lunch status.   Teachers work in collaboration at all times at P.S. 516, establishing strong coherency both within and across grades.  Teachers are expected to continually refine and grow their practice, and work closely with instructional coaches on  staff and with staff developers from Teacher’s College, Generation Ready, and our school support network. In  addition to our academic program, we believe that children need well-rounded and holistic opportunities to close the  achievement and opportunity gap. Students participate in daily visual arts, dance, physical education, and STEM  programming to support the development of the whole child. A variety of partnerships support our holistic, whole- child approach. These partnerships include coding and robotics programming provided by Sunset Spark, swimming  lessons through the YMCA, urban gardening through City Growers, Inc., and a variety of arts partnerships with the  Center for Arts Education and Creative Music Programs. In order to support the social-emotional needs of our  students and families, a school social worker joined the staff in 2015 in order to provide additional services to support  students, families, and teachers in supporting children in crisis and providing at-risk counseling services as needed.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Over 64% of our student population are English language learners; as such, they require additional language  acquisition services, including bilingual and ENL programming. Approximately 10% of our students reside in temporary  housing; and as such, benefit from additional supports with attendance, materials, and individualized family outreach.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Last year, our school made the most progress with the following Framework for Great Schools elements:   1) Collaborative Teachers: Innovation and Collective Responsibility   Establishing a school culture and climate that focused on high expectations for self and students that is shared and  lived by all members of the community has been a priority. In this year's school survey, responses highlighted this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      focus area as one of success, evidenced by the following metrics which surpassed last year's school results and this  year's district and city results:   - 97% of teachers say they are actively trying to improve their teaching;   - 91% of teachers say that teachers take responsibility for improving the school;   - 94% of teachers say that teachers are eager to try new ideas;   - 97% of teachers say that teachers feel responsible that all students learn.   Teachers are incredibly invested in the growth of our school community, which includes both improving their  instructional practice and improving outcomes for student performance. Teachers trust one another, look to  colleagues as experts, and are encouraged to try our new methods and practices that are research-based and help  advance student performance and progress.   2) Strong Family and Community Ties: Outreach to Parents   Last year, our SLT focused on addressing feedback that current parent outreach methods did not result in a  representative representation of most parents at school events, meetings, workshops, and other activities. In an  effort to reach more parents with timely information and encourage greater participation, the SLT, in conjuction with  the PTA President and Parent Coordinator, implemented several initiatives. This included:   - Holding both morning and evening PTA meetings each month, providing greater options for working families;   - Offering both morning and afternoon workshops, which were led by the parent coordinator, CBOs, and other staff  members;   - A weekly email newsletter to families highlighting school upcoming events, activities and opportunities;   - Embedding additional social activites, such as pot-lucks, coffee hour, and cultural celebrations.   These initiatives resulted in achieving our goal of increasing parent participation by at least 5% over the previous year,  as tracked by attendance at all activities.   This year, our key areas of focus are:   1) Rigorous Instruction: Quality of Student Discussion   As a school that serves a high number of English language learners and second langauage learners in both ENL and  bilingual programs, student production of oral language continues to be an area of focus and priority for us. While  understanding that in the language acquisition process oral and written production often develop last, it is still critical  to focus on and build in our students, the opportunities and supports needed to engage in academic discussion and  discourse from an early age. Last year, our school engaged in its first Cycles of Learning process, in which grade-level  teams focused on student discussion as a problem of practice and began implementing change ideas to help improve  student discussion. While the school survey reflected minor increases in teachers responding positively to the below  metrics, student discussion will remain an instructional focus area for us in the 2018-2019 school year. In this year's  school survey, the following teacher responses indicated the need for continued focus on student discourse and  discussion:   - 39% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes build on each others' ideas during class  discussion (38% in 2017-2018);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      - 33% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes use data or text references to support  their ideas (28% in 2017-2018);   - 76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes show that they respect each others' ideas  (72% in 2017-2018);   - 58% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes provide constructive feedback to their  peers/teachers (45% in 2017-2018);   - 76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes participate in class discussions at some  point (85% in 2017-2018).    2) Rigorous Instruction: Academic Press   This year's Principal Performance Review noted the Quality Review Indicator 1.2, Pedagogy, as an area for  improvement. Specially, the feedback stated, "Work to enhance the level of challenge as it is not yet consistently high  in every classroom. Improving the instructional practices to better support "productive struggle" and greater levels of  student challenge will ensure that all students have the requisite skills for academic success school wide."  Furthermore, this year's school survey indicated the teachers themselves responded that no all students feel  challenged in class and/or have to work hard to do well. While these rates were on par with the district and city, we  know that we have more work to do in refining both curriculum and instructional practices to better meet the needs  of all learners, to ensure that struggling students receive the supports they need while high-performing students are  appropriately challenged.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K516   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   432   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. An area of strength relative to this Framework element is our ability to revise and adapt curriculum in order to  provide multiple means for students to access content and express their understanding.   - The 2017-2018 Principal Performance Observation indicated, "As the founding school leader, the principal's curricula  decisions have established rich learning opportunities that are Teacher's College ELA focused and interdisciplinary  with a remarkable emphasis on student discourse and hands-on experiential learning. This is an essential component  for this largely immigrant and ELL population who are further supported by a strong Dual Language program."       2. A priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element in the school year is  to deepen the integrated units of study that were developed in the 2017-2018 school year by creating a standards- based final assessment project, with a standards-based rubric, that will include multiple forms of demonstration of  learning, through both writing and presentation, for each student to successful complete an integrated unit of study.  Last year, there was not a measured assessment piece at the end of the integrated units, leaving teachers with a lack  of data that would show student learning of content and skills.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, after completing two CCLS-aligned interdisciplinary units of study, students will have produced two  culminating projects of their choice that demonstrate and synthesize their learning, as measured by grade-level  performance on a common rubric.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  1. The 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review named Quality Review indicators 1.4 and 3.4 as areas of strength,  stating that "The culture of this school bears the imprint of the leader's commitment to honor all cultures and bring  people together by creating an extremely welcoming environment where all communication happens in three  languages. For this reason, parents are well-informed partners and other actively seek admission to this school."  Additionally, the review stated, "The principal has clearly and consistently shared the high expectations of the school  with the entire community. Teachers in turn create challenging opportunities for learning for ELLs. The curriculum is  never watered down but supported with scaffolds such as visuals, seen school-wide that expand accessibility. Parent  meetings and workshops with translation help families to understand and establish college and career expectations."  Additionally, our last Quality Review named these same indicators, 1.4 and 3.4, as areas of celebration: “The schools  approach to culture-building and social-emotional support is informed by a theory of action and results in a safe  environment and inclusive culture that supports progress toward the school’s goals. The school community  strategically aligns professional development, family outreach, and student learning experiences and support,  resulting in the adoption of effective academic and personal behaviors.”      2. Our work to deepen the sense of community among students will continue this coming year with the  implementation of grade-level community meetings that allow for greater opportunities for students in dual language  and non-dual language programs, of different language groups and ethnicities, to come together for a common  purpose of community building. While teachers work to create a strong sense of community within their classrooms,  we recognized the need to help students see themselves as part of a larger community as more incidents of conflict or  misunderstanding took place in the last year, most frequently in common areas when students are mixed into groups  that are different from the classmates. We recognize that not only do students need to have a strong sense of trust  and community within their classroom, but helping build this same connection across classrooms would be important  work to help deepen the supportive community already in place. Community Meetings will focus on school-wide core  values, team-building, and conflict-resolution, thereby contributing to a strong and safer school community that all  students are invested in.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. The most recent Quality Review (2014-2015) and Principal Performance Review (2017-2018) rated indicator 4.2,  "Teacher teams and leadership development", well-developed. It was noted that all teachers engage in professional  collaboration around teacher practice and student work analysis. The work of teacher teams strengthens teacher  capacity and results in improved students’ performance.   The 2015-2016 and the 2016-2017 Principal Performance Reviews named indicator 4.2 as areas of strength and  celebrating, stating, "The teachers at the school, comfortable with their relationship with the principal and the culture  of collaboration engage in observation that follow the low inference protocol and include post-observation  conversation sand follow-up with written feedback. Further, teachers meet frequently individually with the principal  to discuss student progress and data. This is masterful." Feedback also stated, "teachers are engaged in structured  professional collaborations that have strengthened teacher instructional capacity and promoted the implementation  of CCLS, resulting in school-wide instructional coherence that includes some vertical team work. Distributed  leadership structures are embedded so that there is effective teacher leadership and teachers play an integral role in  key decisions that affect student learning across the school."   In the 2017-2018 School Survey, 97% of teachers said that they feel responsible that all students learn. 95% of  teachers said that they have opportunities to work productively with colleagues in the school.    2. In the 2017-2018 school year, one of our key areas of focus will be improving the quality of student discussion  through the use of collaborative inquiry among teacher teams. This focus area was determined based upon feedback  from the district superintendent and responses from this year's School Survey, which noted the following:    - 39% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes build on each others' ideas during class  discussion;   - 33% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes use data or text references to support  their ideas;   - 76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes show that they respect each others' ideas;   - 58% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes provide constructive feedback to their  peers/teachers;   - 76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes participate in class discussions at some  point.    In 2017-2018, a school inquiry team that studied student discussion and the effects of small teaching shifts on student  discourse. Shifts in instructional practice that resulted in more student discussion were noted in the informal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      observations conducted in the spring following this cycle of inquiry.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. In the 2017-2018 School Survey, the Framework Element Score for Effective School Leadership increased by +0.56  points from the previous school year, reflecting areas of success, especially in the areas of Inclusive Leadership,  Instructional Leadership, and Teacher Influence. These scores ranged anywhere for 5% to 13% higher than city and  district averages.    The 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review also noted indicator 1.3, Resource Allocation, as an area of strength,  stating, "The principal is incredibly reflective and utilizes every available resource to support improved student  outcomes through quality instructional practices. Though not a school with extensive funding, the principal creatively  uses her Title 1 funding to provide students with meaningful and engaging educational experiences. Hiring is an  especially strong skill, as is the use of targeted professional development."   2. While inclusive leadership and teacher influence remain areas of strength, program coherence was again noted as  an area of weakness in this year's School Survey results. Specifically, 74% of teachers agreed that the school, once  they start a new program, follows up to make sure that it's working. 74% of teacher agreed that their school is clear  how all of the program offered are connected to their school's instructional vision. 77% of teachers agreed that their  school curriculum, instruction, and learning materials are all well coordinated across the different grade level.    In conversations this year in both SLT and among staff, overcoming cultural and racial divides has surfaced as a  priority need for staff, students, and parents. With both dual and non-dual language programs, the tracking into and  within these programs tend to create an unintended segregation of students from various cultural and linguistic  backgrounds, resulting in fewer opportunities for students to learn from differences. Staff also resported feeling as  through they were not always equipped with the language, skills, and tools to lead proactive conversations around  race and equity with students in developmentally appropriate ways. Finally, school leaders noted more instances of  negative language connected to race, culture, and ethnicity being used between students. We recognize the need to  go further with our racial equity work at the school-wide level.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, school leaders will schedule six professional development sessions in order to provide teachers with tools  and resources to discuss and develop instructional plans that address race, culture, and equity to be implemented in  classrooms with students, as measured by teacher survey responses which measure their level of confidence in  addressing classroom conversations about race, culture, and equity.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Indicator 3.4 - High Expectations was rated "well-developed" in the 2014-2015 Quality Review, and has also  consistently been rated "well-developed" in the Principal Performance Observations from 2014 through 2018.  Feedback indicated that "The principal has clearly and consistently shared the high expectations of the school with  the entire school community. Teachers in turn create challenging opportunities for learning for all students, including  ELLs. The curriculum is never watered down but supported with scaffolds such as visuals, seen school-wide that  expand accessibility. Parent meetings and workshops with translation help families to understand the learning and  establish college and career expectations."    Furthermore, in the 2017-2018 School Survey, 95% of parents said that school staff regularly communicate with them  about how parents can help their child learn and 100% of teachers felt that teachers understand families' problems  and concerns. 100% of teacher say that teachers work closely with families to meet students' needs, and 97% of  parents say that teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs.    This year, our SLT and PTA worked in collaboration to increase the frequency and forms of outreach to families to  encourage more opportunities for engagement and participation that went beyond a typically meeting structure. As  such, we saw an increase in participation in all school events as the offerings were more varied and suited more  parent schedules and interests.    2. Our school has consistently implemented a "Family Friday", during which time all classrooms are opened to families  on the first Friday of each calendar month. Teachers prepare for these Fridays by planning a hands-on, interactive  activity for families to participate in with their child. While participation is relatively high for these sessions, we  noticed several trends emerging based upon feedback from both teachers and the SLT. Teachers reported that it was  often challenging to plan for and prepare for an activity that parents would feel as relevant. Furthermore, the  activities seemed time-consuming and disconnected from the learning go on in the classroom. Parents expressed  more desire to become involved in the classroom in other forms than just observing, and have suggested ideas such  as having parents take the lead in teaching a lesson, reading a book, being interviewed, and participating in  alternative ways. We recognize the in order to stay relevant, engaging, and interesting and in service of building  positive relationships between the school, teachers, and parents, revising our Family Friday structure and plan is in  the best interests of our school community.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We believe that the most effective way to improve the achievement of students is to improve the quality of teaching.  Our professional development program is coherent in that we emphasize a deep understanding of the curriculum and  focus much time and attention of teachers becoming masters of the content they teach. This is coupled with a clear  instructional vision that is supported through evaluation and supervision by the principal and through cycles of  coaching with the school’s literacy coach.    In recruiting teachers, administrators create a job posting that clearly describes the instructional approach of the  school and criteria necessary to work and succeed in our school. The posting is circulated to local prestigious teaching  institutions, such as Bank Street and Teacher’s College. In conjunction with the school hiring committee, candidates  deemed highly qualified are invited to interview with the committee. Candidates who possess multiple licenses are  sought out in order to serve the needs of our student population, including teachers who have a bilingual extension in  order to provide flexible language programming for students.       Teaching assignments are subject first and foremost to staffing teachers that are most qualified and hold proper  licensing and certification to a particular classroom vacancy. Each spring, teachers submit a preference sheet, as per  joint DOE and UFT guidelines, for their teaching assignments for the upcoming school year. We work thoughtfully as a  hiring committee and administrative cabinet to make sure that all teachers preferences are honored as long as needs  of the school, licensing, certification, and most qualified candidates are placed in those assignments.      Our approach for both teacher retention and continued professional development go hand-in-hand. We believe a  school community in which teachers feel connected to their colleagues and supported in their instructional growth  becomes a place where teachers wish to stay and continue to grow and work.   All staff members attend a one - to two -week long (budget-driven) training program in the summer led by the  principal, coach, and teacher leaders. Teachers use the contractual 155 minutes per week to work in teacher teams,  along with the ENL teacher, literacy coach, visual arts teacher, and principal in order to discuss curriculum and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      instruction and support individual professional development plans. In this way, all teachers work together to provide  seamless instruction and ensure greater instructional coherency across the school.    All staff is expected to participate in Teacher’s College professional development opportunities. Teachers are  encouraged to attend additional DOE-sponsored PD offerings, and work with the principal to seek out additional  professional development opportunities that align to individual needs. The school will continue to engage in work  with network instructional liaisons in order to inter-visit other schools in the network that have well-developed  practices in the respective areas that a teacher may benefit from seeing. Within the school, teachers are expected to  engage in rounds of inter-visitation with one another, and follow those visits with conversations about their practice.   Teachers serve as rotating grade-team leaders in cycles across the year. They take the lead on planning and  coordinating curriculum and instruction in these areas and leading and facilitating grade-team meetings. In addition,  teacher leaders facilitate school-wide professional development session across the year and serve as mentors by  opening their classrooms to other teachers for inter-visitation.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   During the school’s week-long summer training, the staff examines the CCLS for literacy and math and engages in the  process of backwards design for unit and curriculum development. This process is the foundation for teacher team  planning throughout the school year as teachers begin to revise and design new units of study.    Teacher teams participate in 115 minutes of professional development each week (80 minutes on Mondays, 35  minutes on Tuesdays). Grade-level teams, the ENL teacher, Visual Arts teacher, Literacy Coach/Intervention Teachers,  Math Coach, and principal rotate between grade teams to build coherence among personnel during this time. Each  week focuses on a different content area. During this time, teams look at curriculum in depth, revise our unit and  lesson planning, and reflect on student work products and engage in data analysis.    We will continue our partnerships with Teacher’s College, Generation Ready, and the Math Collective this year to  provide high-quality, individualized professional development for our teachers. This includes at least 12 on-site days  of direct work with teachers at our school. Our instructional coaches participate in these development days and then  create plans for bringing the work forward until the next cycle of staff development days. Our staff developer has  stayed with us over the course of these initial two years, and knows and understands the needs of our students and  uses this to plan high-leverage sessions geared towards the specific needs of each grade and/or vertical team. This  year-long partnership supports the tailoring of our curriculum and instruction to better meet the needs of our  students through the development of teacher practice. Teachers participate in calendar conference days at Teacher's  College each year, and other professional development session offered through our Borough Field Support Center  (BFSC).    The literacy and math coaches engage in six-week professional development cycles with individual teachers to work  on specific instructional skills. Through co-teaching, demo-lessons, modeling, and de-briefing, the coach actively  supports teachers in differentiated ways. Each cycle includes the development of an action plan and a final reflection  on work engaged in.   The teacher evaluation system has also created a regular space for the principal and individual teachers to engage in  conversation about teaching practice. After identifying professional goals for the year in our initial conferences, the  principal engages in frequent observation and evaluation on all eight components of the rubric, with specific emphasis  on the teacher’s individual growth areas. Beginning of year, mid-year and end-of-year self-assessments and  reflections with the principals further the conversation around individual professional development.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      The principal and assistant principal participate in monthly professional on the district level, focusing on observation  and feedback cycles and other whole-school reform initiatives.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Pre-Kindergarten teachers follow an emergent-curriculum based on following the interests of students. Through  observation and facilitation of play and center-based learning, teachers scaffold language and learning that is  connected to the Pre-Kindergarten Foundation for the Common Core. In addition to collaborating with their  colleagues on the Kindergarten and 1 st grade teams through school-wide and vertical professional development  structures, Pre-Kindergarten teachers have a clear understanding of Kindergarten readiness skills that they work  towards during the year in Pre-Kindergarten.    Upon receiving an offer to the school for Kindergarten, families are invited to an orientation session in which they  hear from the Kindergarten teachers about the transition to Kindergarten, expectations for the year, and ways to  support their child over the summer in building independence to help set them up to a successful start to the  Kindergarten school year.    Children enrolling in our Kindergarten class meet with a Kindergarten teacher, who conducts a short screening to  assess Kindergarten readiness skills and oral language development. This helps us get a foundational understanding of  the child so we can best meet their needs at the very start of the school year. Classes are also tentatively planned to  ensure a heterogeneous make-up.    Back-to-School night is held during the first two weeks of school. During this time, parents meet with their child’s  teacher to learn about curriculum, instruction, social-emotional development, and expectations for the year ahead.    Early intervention services are coordinated on-site at the school, so related service providers are aware of possibly  needs of individual students so we can provide intervention as early as possible.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Days are set aside in June for Pre-K teachers to meet with Kindergarten teachers, and Kindergarten teachers to meet  with 1 st grade teachers, etc. in order to review and transfer student records. Students portfolios are passed on to the  next year’s teacher at this time in order to help the new teacher have knowledge, prior to the start of the school year,  of the strengths and needs of individual students.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams develop and design the end-of-unit assessments and tasks and accompanying rubrics for our  curriculum units. Teachers plan these assessments in grade-teams and use grade-level Common Core standards as a  guide.    Literacy Benchmark assessments are based on Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project Independent Reading  Level Continuum, Primary Reading Benchmarks, and the Writing Continuum for Informational, Narrative, and Opinion  writing. Independent Reading levels are collected and shared with administrators on a monthly basis. Primary Reading  Benchmarks are assessed, collected, and analyzed four times per year in November, January, March and June. Writing  units of study always being with an “On-Demand” writing prompt in all grades. Teacher teams analyze this writing to  set instructional goals for students and revise lesson plans to meet the needs of students. End-of-unit published  writing pieces are assessed according the genre-based rubrics in grade-level teams.   A baseline assessment in mathematics is conducted in September for all grades (NYC Performance Assessment Tasks).  The results of this baseline in used to inform instruction for groups of students for the fall. A mid-year assessment is  conducted to assess student progress toward grade-level standards. A final year-end assessment is conducted in  May/June to assess mastery of grade-level math standards. Individual units of study always end with an assessment  and performance task that is evaluated according to common rubrics and results are used to plan continued small  group instruction for students who did not show mastery of content objectives.      A structured plan is in place for the use of Monday Professional Development time for administrators and  instructional coaches to meet with grade teams of teachers to analyze assessment data at every grade level, based on  assessments points from the curricula scope and sequences. Instructional coaches lead teachers through looking at  student work with protocols, to make informed decisions about continuing instruction for both individual and groups  of students.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S.516, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 516 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   · providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   · providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   · fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   · providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   · sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      · providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   · actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    · maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   · conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    · provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   · host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      · schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   · translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    · conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.       The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   · holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   · hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   · encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   · supporting or hosting Family Day events;   · establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   · encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   · providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;   · developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   · providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 516, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Our current NYSESLAT data has revealed that a greater number of ELLs in  grades K-2 reach the COMMANDING level.  Whereas, a majority of students that are still  determined to be ELLs in upper grades show that they tend to linger on a  single NYSESLAT level much longer.  Though the number of ELLs in the upper grades reduces  (due to the greater number of children testing out in grades K-2), the need for more  opportunities to develop language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, writing) in an  authentic setting increases.  Based on the current upper elementary ELL population in grades 3  and 4, and enrollment in the program for the past three years, it is anticipated that approximately  30 students will participate in the Title III after school program.  For instruction, there will be a ratio of 1 teacher:7 (approx.) students for each rotating  group.  Student participants will be selected from grades 4 & 5 based on the ELL's needs for  language development.  Additionally, eight ESL/BL instructors will teach on a rotating basis -  four teaching teaching on the first day of the program after school, four different teachers  teaching on the second day of the program.  To harness the greatest points of leverage - authentic language learning and high levels of  student interest - ELLs participating in the Title III after school program will be exposed to grade  level chapter books and a media counterpart of the same book.  For example, ELLs will share in  a read aloud of specifically targeted excerpts from Charlotte's Web and will then view a  correlating excerpt from the Charlotte's Web movie.  Following these two activities,  ELLs will participate in character discussion, plot development, etc. to create video and  blog materials for PS 516's "Books & Bytes" YouTube channel.  Attendance will be logged on a Google sheet at the beginning of each session.  Schedule and Duration:  The Title III program will run for 18 sessions over the course of 9 weeks; with an anticipated  start date of Wednesday, October 10, 2018 and an end date of Thursday, December 20th,  2018.  These projections are dependent upon funding and teacher availability in the upcoming  school year.  It is also anticipated that all 30 of the participating ELLs will attend 2 sessions a  week making a total of 18 sessions.  Sessions will be on Wednesdays and Thursdays from  2:40PM- 4:10PM; beginning 1/9/19 and ending 3/14/19.  Language of Instruction:  Direct instruction will be delivered in English, with supplemental native language support  provided by bilingual teachers.  Teachers:  A total of 6-8 teachers will facilitate the Title III program on a rotating basis, with 3 teachers  facilitating 3 small groups each session.  Additionally, 2 bilingual staff members will be utilized  to translate necessary documents that will be sent home to guardians about the program.Per  session funding will be used for teacher planning time and for instructional time, which will total  between 60-65% of the budget.  Participating teachers hold certifications in TESOL or Dual  Language (Spanish/Chinese).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52   Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Materials:  - Selection of grade-appropriate text/movie pairings  -Art Supplies (including materials and performances)         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             As we view all teachers as teachers of ELLs and all students learners of English, it is imperative  that we provide comprehensive professional development to staff that develops their pedagogy in  best practices for teaching ELLs. This includes a major focus on understanding the language  acquisition process, comprehensible input, and adjusting and modifying curricula to meet the  needs of students. Specifically, in focusing on the development of both receptive and expressive  language skills, all teachers participate in professional development that connects to listening,  reading (receptive) and speaking, writing (expressive). We are most supported in this work  through our partnership with Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project.  All teachers of ELLs (all teachers in our school) work closely with the Teacher's College  Reading and Writing Project to support their professional learning throughout the school year in  the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. This includes over 12 days of on-site staff  development with our staff developers that addresses adapting and modifying instructional  methods to meet the needs of ELLs in accessing the literacy curriculum. Teachers also attend  calendar days at Teacher's College through the year to further their study of effective practices  for literacy instruction. Teachers also participate in and attend professional development sessions  offered by our Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) that address ENL instructional strategies,  language development, and planning for instruction that considers and addresses language  objectives and progressions.  Our ENL and Bilingual Team attend the professional development offerings through the Office  of English Language Learners throughout the year as they are announced and become available.  Our school's in-house professional development  focuses on building all teachers' pedagogy in  supporting language learners, and we dedicate each Election Day PD session to this focus.  Teachers watch videos of effective instruction, modify curriculum to provide entry and access  for ELLs, and collaborate to plan for integrated co-teaching with ENL teachers that are paired  with each grade team.

We will also plan for a showcase of the student- created blog and pod cast at the end of the program.  Topics of planned workshops include:1. Brooklyn Public Library: We plan to take parents to the  library and help them register their family/child for a library card. Parents will learn about  resources available at the library in their native language that they can use to read with their  children at home. (November 2018, 1 session).  2. Home Connections Through Games: We've found that it is particularly powerful to help  educate families on ways they can be actively involved in their child's learning that are non- threatening. One of the ways to actively involved parents in their child's learning and support  practice of concepts and language at home is through games. The right games can zero in on any  need or interest a child might have. An educational game night will be hosted at the school, and  materials needed to play any of the games will be distributed and sent home with families so they  can easily engage with their child at home. (December 2018, 1 session).  3. Homework: Homework that is in a different language can be especially daunting for families.  In order to teach parents effective strategies for engaging with and supporting their child with  homework, we plan to host a meeting to share these strategies with parents. This includes  bilingual/picture dictionaries, types of questions to ask children about books to assess their  understanding, and types of focused conversations to help develop student's oral language skills  (January 2109, 1 session).

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  TCRWP Benchmarks for reading are used to assess Letter Identification, Letter-Sound Knowledge, Concepts of Print, and Sight  Word Knowledge in English instruction classes.  In Spanish Dual Language classes, Estrellita and Senderos is used to monitor  the same aforementioned literacy skills.  These tools are used in the early primary grades, and also used to assess new-comers,  four times per year: September, January, March, and June.  On a monthly basis, Fountas and Pinnell Running Records (in English and Spanish language classes) are used to assess students'  independent reading levels in grades K - 5 throughout the year.  This helps monitor decoding and comprehension skills.  All of this data is entered into our data management tool we created in Google Drive.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Based on the data gained from literacy assessments, small instructional groups and intervention groups - with the Literacy  Coach or an ENL teacher - are determined.  Students work in small, homogeneous groups focused on specific skill areas for a  six-week cycle.  At the end of the cycle, students are assessed for progress and new groups are formed based on up-to-date  data.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We track the progress and success of each ELL student by examining their formal and informal assessments, conferring notes,  and state/city test results (i.e. NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA Exam etc.).     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    With the date from the above information, and by considering the four language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and  writing) data is analyzed and evaluated to determine whether to continue interventions as they are, or if changes to  instruction are needed to better support language learners in various modalities.  Educators will meet as a team to reflect and  review what components work and do not work and make amendments to curriculum and instruction as necessary.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school aligns our instruction according to the "three tiers of instruction support" described in the RTI model.  First, we  create rigorous and evidence based core instruction.  If learners are struggling after whole group instruction, we then target  intentional small groups that need support in specific areas, and teach through targeted activities, experiences, and lessons.  If  learners continue to struggle after small group instruction, then intensive, individualized instruction is implemented - in  addition to whole and small group learning.    This model of intervention is used across content areas.  Administrators, coaches, classroom teachers, and ENL teachers use  best practices for integrated teaching time to ensure that each language learner is supported in a fashion that will result in  academic and language growth.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As a small growing school we only have two years of state testing data.  Thus, NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results and classroom  performance (Fountas & Pinnel levels, math assessments, etc.) are the main resources used to cull information.  As the school  continues to grow to 5th grade, ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies state assessments will be included with the two  aforementioned sources for a wider analysis.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   After data analysis, ENL teachers meet with classroom teachers on a monthly basis to account for changes that need to take  place in order to move learners towards a direction of growth in all four language modalities: listening, speaking, reading, and  writing.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         The Freestanding ENL program is scheduled using the stand-alone/integrated model.  Where ELLs are placed in  general education classes heterogeneously and co-taught with an ENL and classroom teacher during integrated  minutes.  ELLs requiring stand-alone minutes are also pulled out into small groups and provided instruction solely by  the ENL teacher.  Each ELL receives the appropriate amount of stand-alone and integrated minutes based on their  proficiency level and the protocol outlined in CR-154.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     There is no TBE program at PS 516.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      ELLs in the Dual Language program are all grouped heterogeneously and receive mandated minutes in two ways:   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   ENL Instructional Minutes:  Based on a student's proficiency level as per the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT, units of study for stand-alone and integrated ENL are  determined.  In the Freestanding ENL Program and in the side by side Dual Language programs model (where the English  Instructor is NOT TESOL certified), all ENL teachers co-teach with classroom teachers in the general education classroom to  supply integrated ENL minutes.  Students requiring stand-alone minutes receive pull-out services in small groups with the ENL  teacher.  In the side by side Dual Language model (where the English Instructor is TESOL certified) and where the teacher  provides BOTH English and Spanish instruction, the classroom teacher provides both integrated and stand-alone minutes.  This  scheduling is determined by both administration and ENL staff.    ELA Instructional Minutes:  All ELLs receive regular ELA instruction in the classroom setting.  At this time, these minutes are supported by integrated co- teaching with the ENL teacher (as stated above).     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students in both ENL and Dual Language programs receive core content within and outside of the classroom.  ELA and  Mathematics are supported each day in the classroom via TCRWS and EngageNY curricula, respectively.  Social Studies core  content is woven into instruction two periods per week within the classroom.  Students receive science core content twice a  week outside of the classroom during STEAM cluster periods.  All teachers engage in two integrated units of study throughout  the year where ELA is taught through content area.    Teachers in all programs study effective pedagogy for ELLs, including use of visuals, gestures, TPR, etc., to boost  comprehensible input for all students.  With the exception of STEAM periods, content area subjects are taught in English for students in the ENL program, and in  English and Spanish for students in the Dual Language program.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Throughout the year Bilingual and ENL teachers assist with the assessment and evaluation of language learners.  For students  in the Dual Language program, assessments are done in both the HL and target language for all assessments.  For students in  the ENL program, with HL supports when possible, students are evaluated in the target language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      a. SIFE  We do not current have any SIFE students.  However, our plan will provide for these students to receive after in-school  intervention to support additional academic and language development.  A structured immersion program will allow for  students to receive instruction that is tailored to specifically meet their needs.  b. Newcomer  Newcomers receive daily instruction using methodologies and approaches to foster social and academic language growth,  such as: Total Physical Response (TPR), the Whole Language approach, and Communicative Language Teaching (where use of  the student’s native language is accepted during these early stages of language development).  A wide range of materials to  support instruction is regularly used: realia, scaffolded small groups, visual aids, manipulatives, enlarged books, vocabulary  cards, various word study activity kits, and books with audio supplements.  Newcomers in testing grades receive intervention  during the school day via small group instruction and have the opportunity to attend after school sessions to further reinforce  learned skills.  As a school community, we understand it is a priority that ELLs feel safe and cared for before language learning  can occur.  The school works to understand the culture, family life, history, educational background, and personal information  of each student and their family to help guide Newcomer instruction and how to differentiate to meet each student's personal  needs.  c. Developing  Developing ELLs are supported in their literacy skills as well as their skills in English language acquisition.  Again, small groups  are utilized to hone in an specific areas of need that developing ELLs may present.  Examples of specific small group instruction  includes: explicit exploration of text organization, use and development of complex sentences (in writing and speaking), and  use of higher order academic language use in reference to core content.  d. Long Term  As this is an elementary school that currently serves ELLs from Kindergarten through 3rd grade, there are no Long Term  ELLs.  Nonetheless, should the situation arise, a program outline is in place.  Long term ELLs will continue to receive academic  support through small group intervention, and a continued look at best practices for that Long Term ELL based upon data and  performance analysis.  A structured immersion instructional program will allow for Long Term ELLs to receive instruction that  is tailored specifically to their needs.  e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  As per CR-154, Former ELLs receive .5 units of ENL instruction per week.  This instruction takes place inside of the classroom  during integrated minutes and the Former ELL receives instruction as appropriate for the variety of language and academic  needs that present themselves.  Both whole group, small group, and individual conferencing instruction are utilized with  Former ELLs to grow both academic and social language, as well as concepts.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are also SWDs receive accommodations as appropriate and according to their IEP.  ELL-SWDs are currently served  through the ICT classroom model.  For ELL-SWDs participating in the DL program, where there currently aren't ICT classroom  models in place, when appropriate, a bilingual special education teacher provides acadenic instruction that supports all  academic and language needs as per their IEP.  This particular population is serviced by ENL teachers for both stand-alone and integrated ENL programming as per CR-154 (as  outlined above).  All teachers of ELL-SWDs follow a standards-based, Common Core aligned curriculum in Literacy,  Mathematics, and Content areas.  Teachers work in collaboration to plan for and further refine units of study and lessons that  incorporate both content and language objectives, in addition to pedagogical techniques that support language access and  development for a SWD.  For example, TPR, SIOP lesson planning, translanguaging, and visual and gestural supports are all  utilized.  Technology is also utilized to support learning.  This includes but is not limited to: interactive whiteboards, iPads, and  Imagine Learning software use.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  If an ELL-SWDs has an IEP that requires a specialized placement, such as needing to be placed in an ICT setting,  accommodations are made and flexible grouping within the ICT classroom is utilized.  The ENL teacher pushes in to the  ICT classroom to provide integrated services in small groups and will service an ELL-SWD in stand-alone sessions when   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      necessary as per CR-154.  Again, for ELL-SWDs participating in the DL program, where there currently aren't ICT classroom  models in place, when appropriate, a bilingual special education teacher provides academic instruction that supports all of the  student's needs as per their IEP.  Additionally, ENL and classroom teachers work in collaboration to discuss individual students on a regular basis - weekly,  monthly.  Using specific, student-centered information, together teachers plan and/or modify instruction to teach ELL- SWDs within their linguistic zone of proximal development, whilst considering appropriate special education modifications.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Based on benchmark assessments - formative and summative - classroom teachers, ENL teachers, bilingual teachers, and  intervention teachers establish flexible groups for instruction during integrated push-in instruction in the classroom.  Again,  using an RTI model, teachers work with small groups of students to target specific groups to support ELLs in ELA, Math and  other content areas as needed based on academic data analysis.  Small groups are flexible and include ELLs at all proficiency  levels, Entering through Commanding.  If learners continue to struggle after small group instruction, then intensive,  individualized instruction is implemented - in addition to whole and small group learning.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on current EDAT analysis, steps have been taken to further strengthen the strong momentum that has been established  in the speaking and listening modalities for ELLs.  This year, a school-wide focus was placed on academic conversation and  advancement of academic language.  Classroom teachers used new practices and methodology during instruction, engaging in  a series of inquiry cycles to increase student discourse.  When considering areas of need for ELLs, EDAT analysis shows the writing modality needs further enhancement.  Moving  forward, curricula will be considered through the lens of integrated learning, where more hands-on and authentic language  learning opportunities will be afforded to ELLs to create rich experiences to both read and write about     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently open bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  In addition to Title III programs offered to ELLs each school year, a host of other activities and enrichment opportunities are  available for ELLs to participate in.  Each year ELLs and their families are invited to join "Art Tuesdays" where children create  artwork with the art teacher and their guardian after school hours.  This year, we also offered ELLs the opportunity to  participate in an extra-curricular P.E. program after school.  Furthermore, ELLs were given the chance to participate in ELA and  Math test prep to help reinforce skills being learned in the classroom after school hours.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Depending on the lesson plan and group of students, specific materials are intentionally selected to help support our  ELLs.  Some of these materials include: realia, graphic organizers, ELMO document cameras, projectors, interactive white  boards, iPads, laptops, Fundations materials, and literacy centers with audio CDs that accompany text.  When lesson planning,  teachers are expected to consider the visual, tactile and auditory ways to support ELLs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   When appropriate, ENL students' native language is used to support their language acquisition - either for reinforcement or  preview of specific content and vocabulary.  This is facilitated through books in the HL, use of buddy structure throughout the  school day and during various times of instruction, use of bilingual dictionaries, and bilingual personnel in the school  community.   Students in the Spanish Dual Language program receive supports in the HL as mandated by the program outlines in CR-154.  These students have access to English and HL supports on a regular basis.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    As a growing school that will serve students in Kindergarten through fifth grades, teachers are well-versed in understanding  what is developmentally appropriate for students in each of these grade levels.  Using a standards based curriculum, ELLs are  provided instruction in an age-appropriate manner.  Teachers make appropriate modifications to grade-level curriculum for  the varying ELL proficiency levels as needed.  Use of strong visuals, tactile materials, and technological aids like iPads and  Imagine Learning software - students are provided with comprehensible input.  Again, small group work is utilized by  instructors to make classroom content digestible and to help provide entry levels for all ELLs that is appropriate to the grade- level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 516 is not a co-location site.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Following registration for newly admitted students, parents are invited to an orientation in mid-June.  During orientation day,  parents and students take a guided tour of the school, meet and greet teachers and staff, and are provided informational  materials about the school and services available for parents and students.  We also hold a "Back to School Night" in mid- September for parents to return again, and meet with their child's teachers and learn specifically about programming and  expectations.  All of this information is presented in the HL.  For new ELLs that enroll later in the school year, we buddy them up with a classmate that speaks the same language.  It is  imperative that students feel safe, loved and cared for before learning begins.  Parents/Guardians are asked to provided  feedback via surveys so the school can learn as much as possible about the new student to help support him/her in order to  have a smooth transition.  Staff that support the majority of this work include Raquel Nieves, Parent Coordinator, and the ENL Team, Johanna Kelly,  Lan Thanh Nguyen, and Rachael Sullivan.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    As this is an elementary school, we do not currently offer language "electives".  However, parents of ELLs can chose to enroll  their child in the Spanish Dual Language program.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a. Currently, Kindergarten, 3rd grade, and 4th grade Dual Language classrooms are self-contained models  with one teacher in the class that provides both English and Spanish instruction.  1st and 2nd grade Dual  Language classrooms are self contained side-by-side models.  In the side-by-side model, one teacher  provides English instruction and another teacher provides Spanish instruction.  For all DL classrooms  a 50/50 model for division of language is used; English is used 50% of the week and Spanish is used the  other 50% of the week.  Aside from times when small group instruction may be homogeneous, EPs and  ELLs are integrated throughout the entire learning day.  A simultaneous biliteracy program is carried out  in all DL classrooms where students are learning to read and write in both English and Spanish.  b. Core content areas are taught equally in Spanish and English.  c. A color-coding system is used for language separation in DL classrooms.  Red represents the Spanish  language and Blue represents the English language.  For example: teachers will use red markers when   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         writing in Spanish and blue markers when writing in English (on charts and during lessons), red and blue  folders are used to help students separate work in Spanish and English, blue and red paper is used for  writing in each language, book bins are labeled in red or blue to show which texts are in English and  Spanish, etc.  d. Currently, we followed a simultaneous model for emerging and developing literacy.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  A series of professional development sessions throughout the year educate and build pedagogical practices ensuring that all  educators are effective teachers of language.  This professional development plan incorporates both outside partnerships and  in-house opportunities.  Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project:  Since September 2013, we've partnered with TCRWP to provide our school with extensive professional development in  literacy.  All teachers at our school, regardless of position or certification, are expected to participate and build knowledge and  practice in order to provide more effective and responsive instruction for a largely ELL population.  A TC staff developer, works  on-site at our school 11 days out of the year.  During this time, teachers are released throughout the day to study elements of  literacy curriculum and instruction.  Teachers work in collaboration to host lab sites, lesson studies, and refine curricula based  on collaborative work.  In addition to on-site days, we send teachers to participate in "calendar" workshop days at Teacher's  College for a total of 25 days per year.  Each classroom teacher and ENL/Bilingual teacher attends a 1 day workshop at  Teacher's College during the school year.  EngageNY Math Collective:  We participate in a cohort of schools who recently adopted the EngageNY mathematics curriculum, led by a math instructional  coach.  Throughout the year, our teachers work with educators from other cohort schools and participate in rounds of Lesson- Study.  Our focus for the year was on boosting language use and the communication of ideas among students. We have 10  days of on-site professional development, and all classroom teachers participate in at least one lesson-study during the course  of the school year.   Generation Ready:   We partnered with Generation Ready, to support our continued growth in developing units of study and instructional  practices that support ELLs.  A staff developer, will be working will all of our K-5 grade teams to design, develop, and  implement our  Integrated Units.  Teachers will work alongside the staff developer, developing content and pedagogical  knowledge through planning and preparation, followed by participating in a series of labsites in which specific instructional  strategies are modeled. Our staff developer has a strong background in the design of integrated units of study, embedding  balanced literacy and TC practices, and effective pedagogy to provide greater access to ELLs while maintaining challenge for all.  DOE Offerings:  Teachers are encouraged to participate and pursue additional professional development opportunities offered through the  DOE, this includes the Department of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.  CAL:  At various points educators from the Center of Applied Linguistics did whole staff PDs around best instructional practices for  language learners.  Conference Days:  City-wide conference days, including Election Day and June Chancellor's Conference Day, are used to connect instructional  focus and language development.  Staff explores practices in comprehensible input and integrated co-teaching models during  these day-long professional development sessions.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As prescribed by the ELL Policy and Reference Guide and CR-80, 15% of teacher professional development, and and 50% of  Bilingual/ENL teacher development, is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  These professional development  opportunities include classes from (but are not limited to): DELLSS (pedagogical and compliance related), Estrellita,  TCRWP (pertaining specifically to language learners), Brooklyn Borough Field Support Center, and Learning Partners Plus.  For record keeping purposes, a record is placed in the teacher's file in the main office after PD is completed.  And in-house PD  agendas and sign-in sheets are kept on file in our shared Google Drive.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During all interactions, translation is provided for any language represented in our school community.  To continually support  our ELL parents we evaluate their needs during PTA meetings, through parent and child surveys, at parent teacher  conferences/one-on-one meetings.  Agendas and future planning is derived from what we hear from parents during these  meetings.  Thus, these structures allow for parents to be regularly updated about their child's progress and for regular parent  voice in our school.  To further ELL parent involvement, we use our bilingual school aides, our bilingual paraprofessional staff (representing the  Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic languages), and our bilingual teachers to aide in communication.  Other languages that staff  cannot account for are provided through the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Each meeting with a parent is documented with a sign-in sheet, or teacher log.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents are often invited to participate in school activities and celebrations such as: Reader's Theater Presentations (students  act out stories), Publishing Celebrations (students share their finalized writing), cultural holiday celebrations, class trips, Cook  Shop classes, and other volunteer opportunities at our school.  The first Friday of each calendar month is "First Friday" in which families are invited into their child's classroom to experience a  hands-on learning activity.  These classroom visits are often followed by a workshop led by the parent coordinator.  Workshops  include various topics that parents express interest in; shoe-tying, lice prevention, and other next steps to work with their child  at home and further support their learning.  The PTA also regularly coordinates parental involvement activities, including movie nights and parent celebrations to  encourage participation of all parents.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    At P.S. 516, all children are seen as learners of language and all teachers are seen as instructors of language.  Students' and  families' native languages are valued and teaching is considered a collaborative effort of parents, teachers and the  community.  Educational programs help children develop strong literacy and communication skills in both their native and second  language.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jill Smith, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 516 - Sunset Park Avenues                                                                              School DBN: 15K516  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 516 uses the Home Language Survey (HLIS) to assess the need for translation and interpretation for our  families. At initial personal encounters with families, school personnel provides interpretation in several different  languages and/or uses the Translation and Interpretation phone service to communicate with families in their  native language. Parents also indicate their preferred language of spoken and written communication on the blue  card, which is completed at the time of registration to the school. Preferred language information is entered into  ATS by our school secretary and preferred language reports (via RPOB in ATS) are distributed to each classroom  for teachers to reference.      Once a list of all languages is determined, the school ensures that all documents are translated in a timely manner  by providing time for multi-lingual staff to translate documents on-site. The language breakdown is shared with  school aides, who then ensure the correct amount of copies per language - for paper communication - are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      photocopied and distributed to correlated families. Common flyers are always prepared and sent home in the  three main languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese. For oral communication, our school has English, Spanish and  Chinese speakers readily available to both place and receive phone calls. A list of bilingual staff members is posted  and kept on file in the main office for both translation and interpretation needs. When making a phone call to a  family who speaks a language other than the aforementioned three, all staff members use the over-the-phone  services of the Translation and Interpretation Unit.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

On this document, parents' preferred language and phone number(s) are  available. In addition to these documents, student blue cards, with parents' preferred language and phone number(s)  are also portable, accessible, and used if needed. Furthermore, the school's parent coordinator carries a list of all  available parent email addresses.   In order to translate pertinent information, bilingual school personnel is first utilized to contact parents through a  phone call. If necessary, the DOE translation and interpretation hot line is utilized when staff cannot assist in  translation. Additionally, an email blast is sent to parents with pertinent information.
