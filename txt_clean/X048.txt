The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 48, we strive to empower all students by providing rigorous learning experiences to build creativity, the  independence to take academic risks and problem solve in order to become caring, college and career ready citizens  of the 21st Century. Through the involvement of parents, teachers and community members, we will enable our  students to meet future challenges in the global community.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Public School 48 is a Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 5 elementary school located on the Hunts Point Peninsula in the  Bronx, one of the poorest Congressional districts in the United States. There is a high rate of poverty and crime in our  community which is bordered by the Bruckner Expressway and Long Island Sound. The school is surrounded by  wholesale markets, recycling and waste treatment plants as well as a tremendous amount of truck traffic associated  with the Hunts Point Market.   There has been a history of poor leadership at P.S. 48 which has resulted in the school being identified by the State  Education Department as a Focus School for 2017-2018. The school was also identified as a Early Warning School. For  the 2018-2019 school year, a new Principal has been identified and charged with the mission to improve student  outcomes. Under the direct supervision of the District Eight Community School Superintendent, the newly installed  principal will introduce a school-wide improvement plan anchored by three core components:   1. Rebuild the instructional core - curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment - across the content areas in Pre-K through  Grade 5.   2. Re-set school tone, culture, and the classroom environment   3. Re-distribute human and monetary resources to increase impact of targeted academic intervention services and  enrichment opportunities throughout the school day and after school.   P.S. 48 is committed to creating a safe, engaging, and structured environment for students to cultivate their learning.  Students are expected to meet New York State Standards through the use of scaffolds and rigorous curriculum. Our  highly qualified educators will collaboratively plan to provide students with targeted instruction to meet their learning  needs. Teachers will meet on a weekly basis during common preps, grade level and professional learning time to look  at student work and assessments which will inform their plans for effective instruction. Teachers will engage in  professional learning in school and will be provided opportunities for additional professional development workshops  and courses to refine their practice from outside consultants.   School leaders believe that decision-making should include all stakeholders. Working with families and teachers is  necessary to formulate a cohesive vision and plan for school improvement. Parents and educators will be encouraged  to lead through running committees, workshops, grade level teams, and facilitating professional learning  opportunities. School leaders encourage the growth of learning for parents through workshops revolving around the  New York State Standards and sharing strategies to help support our children as they attend PS 48   In an effort to strengthened the culture and tone of the building and reduce the number of incidents, our school has  partnered with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to implement the researched based social-emotional  learning program (R.U.L.E.R.) approach. Last year, the staff created a Contract and implemented the mood meter. This  year, students and their families will be exposed to the curriculum in order to build a positive school climate for all  staff, students, and families.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      In order to provide additional program options for our children, we implemented an Spanish Dual Language program  in kindergarten during the 2017-2018 school year and by the end of the school year in June 2023, we will have a Dual  Language Class on each grade. The goal of our dual language program is for students to become bilingual speakers  where they can speak, read and write in both English and Spanish fluently as they learn content in both languages.   We are a UFT Community Learning School. Through collaboration with our local business, non-governmental  organizations, as well as nonprofits and government agencies, we strive to improve student achievement by meeting  the health, safety and social service needs of students and families. Our Community School Director and Parent  Coordinator work side-by-side with our community partners and agencies to provide needed services to our school,  making our building the hub in the community. The following community based organizations are involved in servicing  our children and their families:     Reading Partners:     AmeriCorps members tutor grades 3 and 4 students in reading during the instructional day.     NY Historical Society Museum:     The Police Athletic League (PAL): PAL provides after school academic tutoring and extra-curricular   enrichment activities for K-5 students based on student needs.     City Year. City Year provides academic intervention services in the classroom and academic enrichment   activities after school to students in grades 3-5.      Education Through Music ( ETM)- Provides professional learning support for our music teachers. As result,   our upper grade teacher was the recipient of the 2018 Grammy Music Education Award which led to our  school receiving $10,000 towards the music program.    Our arts program includes the following celebratory events:   Shakespeare Production with Hunts Point Action Coalition(HPAC)   Student performance during holiday shows for VH1        Annual Children's Voices event- Celebrating children's voices through their writing       Winter and Spring Music Concerts        Student Music Band Program in Grades 3-5   Students participate in creating music videos with famous singers.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At P.S. 48, there are approximately 600 students in Pre-K through Grade 5. Students with special education needs  comprise 30% of the total population while the ENL population accounts for 23% of the total population. We also  have a large population of children living in shelters or doubled up with other families. Our attendance for the 2017- 2018 school year was slightly below 90%. When looking at the number of students attending school less than the 90%  level, 38% of our students were considered chronically absent compared to the City's average of 21% in 2017.   Our special needs populations need access to grade level curricula to allow for multiple entry points to learning,  differentiated learning as well as language and vocabulary development, and the development of math skills to  support grade level work via small group instruction and computer assisted instruction.   As a result we have incorporated several at-risk ELA/Math programs to support the needs of the ENL's and Special  Education children in place including a new Teacher College (TC) phonics program to insure that our 1st and 2nd  grade students are given support at their independent levels. We are also using the Wilson program to support  children at the Tier III level. We are also utilizing I-Ready in all grades 3-5 to insure that students are provided with  additional ELA/Math at-risk instruction. The I-Ready data will also be utilized to differentiate our guided reading  instruction, further supporting our special needs and ENL students as they are provided with a customized  intervention based on their individual needs. Based on performance levels from the NYSESLAT, our ENL students are       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      strategically placed in specific classrooms across all grades so our ENL providers can push-in to each room on a daily  basis during the literacy block. Students will be placed according to their NYSESLAT levels enabling the classroom  teacher to support the students based on their identified area of need. Children in our dual language program will  receive content instruction in both ELA and Spanish as research has shown that students in dual language programs  outperform their monolingual peers. Finally, our special education teachers also differentiate instruction by creating  homogeneous reading groups in K-5 grades in both the self-contained and collaborative team teaching classrooms,  further supporting our students by addressing their literacy and math IEP goals across the grades while providing  equity and access to grade level curricula.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on an analysis of the 2018 June instructional report, our school made the most progress in rigorous instruction  in ELA as evidenced by the fourth grade performance results on New York State ELA Test. Students improved their  performance by 5% as compared to 2017. Students in grades three and five had lower gains. The 2017-2018 F & P  data showed that 73.24 % of our Kindergarten-Grade 5 students demonstrated percentage growth in reading levels,  in comparison to beginning of the year to end of year F& P data.    The key area for focus for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to be rigorous instruction. An analysis of the June  2018 instructional report revealed that our students made very little progress in ELA in grades three and five as  compared to the rest of District Eight and the city. Furthermore, there was very little progress in math across all  grades as compared to the rest of District Eight and the City.   In ELA, there is a need for vocabulary building, a need to engage students in higher order classroom discussions  through rigorous instruction higher level questioning and a need for quality assessment practices to inform instruction  across all grades. This should increase the performance of students in exhibiting higher-order thinking when engaged  in reading comprehension of grade level complex texts. In examining our data, we have also determined that we need  to continue to focus on both phonics/structural analysis and writing skills.    In math, an analysis indicated a need for improvement in areas of number sense, fractions, place value and general  problem solving. These conceptual areas will be addressed through the incorporation of the Five Practices of  Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions and the use of the SOLVE problem solving process via the  implementation of Envisions. This will include an emphasis on utilizing multiple representations to solve problems and  the development of higher level thinking skills in math.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X048   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   697   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our priority needs revolve around math instruction. A review of the 2018 June Instructional Report for Math revealed  that while there was a 3% improvement on the third grade, a 5% improvement on the fourth grade and a 1% increase  on the fifth grade as compared to the performance scores in 2017, our school performed far below the District and City  averages for the same assessment. There is a need to improve student mathematical discussions by anticipating student  responses and monitoring their work, determining the direction of the discussion, ensuring active thinking and  participation by asking good questions and holding students accountable and developing thoughtful lesson plans which  will improve classroom discussions. An analysis of the 2018 Environmental Survey results revealed that only 60% of the  respondents rated the Common Core shifts in math as positive. This was the lowest score across District Eight and  converted to a Level 1.

The school is now in it's 2nd year of implementation of the research based social-emotional learning approach from Yale  University (RULER). The staff collaboratively drafted a school-wide charter and have been introduced to the 4 Anchor  tools of RULER ( i.e. Mood Meter). RULER is an acronym that stands for Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing  and Regulating emotions.   However, a review of 2018 suspension data revealed that there was an increase of incidents from 21 in 2016 to 36  incidents in 2017. An analysis of the 2018 Framework and Environmental Surveys revealed that only 58% of the  respondents viewed classroom behavior as positive which earned a score of 1.67 or a Level 1. Furthermore, only 68%  respondents to the Environmental Surveys indicated that the social emotional environment was positive which was  lowest performing school in the District on this measure and earned the school a level 1 on the Framework.   The school will continue to focus on promoting academic and personal behaviors by integrating aspects of emotional  intelligence into the school culture through classroom lessons. The plan for this year, will be to embed the  implementation of RULER in the classroom through curricula.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           21      A PBIS system of "Tiger Tickets" will continue to be promoted as students voted for a school mascot, and decided on the  tenants of a TIGER (Teamwork, Integrity, Empathy, Respect).

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers are actively involved in the decision making process in regard to the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures as evidenced by the following:     The MOSL Committee meets on a regular basis to select our school-wide MOSL assessments.    The District TDEC will provide professional development, if necessary, to the Administrators and/or the MOSL   Committee in the selection of assessments.     As part of grade level teacher teams, teaches will norm Teacher College learning progressions and rubrics.    As part of grade level teacher teams, teaches will create unit assessments for the new math curriculum      (Envisions) as well as the new science program (Amplify).  Student data from classroom assessments will be analyzed to ascertain if the assessment tool is appropriate  to the content and sufficiently rigorous to support student learning.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 048 Joseph R. Drake, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         P.S. 048 Joseph R. Drake will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47              providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree  upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents  to effectively support their child’s learning.     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48                    schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III program consists of supplemental ENL instruction above and  beyond the mandated requirements of CR Part 154.  The program rationale is to develop content  knowledge aligned to the New York City Dept. of Education (NYCDOE) social studies and  science scope and sequence to accelerate English language acquisition and development.  This  will provide the academic vocabulary and literacy skills to be successful for grade level  demands, including daily lesson and end of unit tasks, formative assessments in literacy,  mathematics, science, and social studies, ultimately impacting student performance on the New  York State (NYS) assessments, in particular the NYSESLAT assessment.  Analysis of the most  recent ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) information indicates that Writing is a core need for  additional instruction.  The continual analysis of updated iterations of the EDAT  will continue to  inform: a) the particular students selected; and b) the focus of the lessons within the program.  In concert with structured English language development, students will engage in authentic,  hands on science, social studies, and art investigations through "Content and Language  Development Units" of 4 sessions each.  Each session will have two components: a) a language  acquisition and literacy development strategy lesson component; as well as a b) content  development component (science, social studies, art) that reinforces the English language  development.  Both components of each of the 4 sessions are connected under an umbrella theme  for an interdisciplinary approach to learning within the particular theme for the selected  unit.  The sessions will be structured as follows:  ·  Reading; and, Component B: Content Experimentation 1  ·  Writing; and, Component B: Content&nbsp;Experimentation 2  ·  Component B: Content Experimentation 3 and Vocabulary Development  ·  Experimentation 4 and Presentation.  Session 1: Component A: Unit Introduction, Literacy Vocabulary Development, and Reading;  and, Component B: Content Experimentation 1  Session 2: Component A: Literacy Vocabulary Development & Descriptive Writing; and,  Component B: Content Experimentation 2  Session 3: Component A: Writing Revision, Editing, and Reflection; and, Component B: Content  Experimentation 3 and Vocabulary Development   Session 2: Component A: Literacy&nbsp;Vocabulary Development &amp; Descriptive   Session 1: Component A: Unit Introduction, Literacy Vocabulary Development, and   Session&nbsp;3: Component A: Writing Revision, Editing, and Reflection; and,   Session 4: Component A: Fact-Based Essay Writing; and Component B: Content       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Session 4: Component A: Fact-Based Essay Writing; and Component B: Content  Experimentation 4 and Presentation.  The units will include geologic investigations (science), weather and seasons (literacy,  technology and art), mapping community locations (literacy, mathematics, geography,  technology), artistic expressions (multimedia: paint, pencil, digital, photography), and physical  literacy (NYRR Rising Runners active learning lessons).  Focus on English writing skills through hands on content-based inquiry and connected short  constructed responses and extended constructed responses with the goal of accelerating  performance on the May 2019 NYSESLAT assessment.  The Title III program ensures English  language acquisition through hands on content-based inquiry targeting each modality (speaking,  listening, reading, writing, and visual).  The end goal: Students will be able to develop on demand short and extended constructed  responses (similar to fact based essays) in preparation for the NYSESLAT.  Students will learn  science content knowledge, along with strategies for applying that content knowledge to the  development of fact based essay.  Writing mini-lessons will prepare students for developing an  essay in one sitting, from brainstorming, organizing ideas, revising, editing, and including an  opening, closing, and relevant details from the information provided.  Additionally, contextual  vocabulary development will enhance speaking and listening skills, and assist reading progress.  Subgroups and Grade Levels of Students to be Served  The grade level is second grade, third grade, fourth grade, and fifth grade.  Tentatively 72  students will be serviced as part of this supplemental program, with groups approximating 12 per  instructor.  ELL students at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding proficiency  levels will receive targeted instruction utilizing English for the duration of the program.  The  group of targeted students has been based on an analysis of the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT)  and NYSESLAT scores to maximize the student gains in learning English.  Based on analysis of  Spring 2016-2018 NYSESLAT scores, students at the Transitioning/Expanding ELLs have been  targeted, with the inclusion of additional students at the Entering and Expanding level on either  the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT (due to teacher observations and school based assessments).  Schedule and Duration  The Title III after school program will take place on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons at the  the conclusion of the regular school day (2:20 p.m.) until 4:20 p.m. This becomes four (4) hours  of supplemental instruction per week that will occur for an estimated duration of 14 weeks, or 56  hours of supplemental instruction per student.  Attendance will be monitored and kept on file in  the school's Title III LEP after school program online learning management system.  # and Types of Certified Teachers  Six (6) NYS-certified teachers will teach the Title III after school program.  Three (3) NYS- certified teachers are NYS TESOL certified, of which one is a National Board Certified Teachers  (NBCT) for English as a New Language (ENL).  Three (3) teachers are NYS elementary  education and/or special education certified with expertise in science, social studies, and art.  The  ENL teachers focus on providing students with strategies and mini-lessons for accelerating  language acquisition.  The ENL teachers model best practices for accessing written materials,  developing the writing craft, and structured academic and social conversations that drive  instructional content objectives aligned to CCLS in literacy and mathematics.  The content area  teachers' role is as content and inquiry specialist, and develops the framework for the curricular  objectives.  The content teacher develops the lessons based on NYC DOE Science and Social  Studies Units of Study and NGSS frameworks, with connections to art.  In concert, the ENL  teachers and content teachers collaborate to present and provide connections through whole  group lessons, and then break the whole group into small groups, as determined by a baseline       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   speaking, listening, reading, and writing assessment, and anecdotal observational recordings tied  to both language development and content goals.  Language of Instruction  The Title III After School program will be conducted in English.  Native language supports are  provided as scaffolds to deepen English language acquisition.  Types of Materials   Key curricular components and materials of the program include Teachers College Reading and  Writing materials, BrainPOP Suite, Myon, Rigby On Our Way, iPads, local Parks, measuring  tapes, rulers, magnifying lens, rocks, SmartBoard, interactive videos, art supplies, and teacher- developed NYSESLAT simulation preparation materials.  Additionally, conferencing notes,  along with formal and informal teacher created assessment and NYCDOE assessments will be  utilized to inform the teacher and school community regarding the ELL students' progress in  developing English languages skills and functions.  Program Assessment  Students in the Title III after school program receive a beginning of program (BP), mid-program  (MP), and end of program (EP) NYSESLAT simulation assessment that targets listening,  reading, and writing Targets of Measure (TOMs) aligned to the NYSESLAT.  The data is  tracked in an online data management environment to analyze growth and areas of weakness,  with shifts in instruction after the MP to pivot towards students' learning needs and targets.  This  allows the program teachers to adapt and modify instruction to meet that specific needs of the  students.  The program teachers reflect on the program's success at the end of the program to  verify and modify the program as needed for future years.  At the end of the Spring 2018  program, the program was deemed a success based on an analysis of student assessment data  with a super majority of assessed students making at least 1 proficiency level gain over the 15  weeks of supplemental instruction, representing an average gain over 12%.   rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             Effective ENL instruction provides the framework for students to successfully acquire academic  English.  In order to optimally address the individual learning needs of the students within the  Title III program, the teachers will delve into ongoing professional development.  Teachers  collaborate to develop and refine lessons and assessments, as well as an inquiry team to gauge  student progress and the success of curriculum materials utilized.

The PD schedule for the Title III takes  place every Monday from 2:20-3:40 during the months of September, October, November, and  December.  The duration of each session is 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Starting in January of the  school year, the professional development becomes monthly, taking place from 2:20-3:40 the  first Monday of every month, until May.  Specifically, there are a total of 18 professional  development sessions for the Title III teachers: 2 sessions in September, 3 sessions in October, 5  sessions in November, 3 sessions in December, and 1 session in each of January, February,  March, April, and May.  There is no professional development session in June.   Topics to be Covered  These sessions provide the basis for developing the curriculum and applying multicultural  strategies.  The planning sessions incorporate the use of Rigby ELL Assessments, Fountas and  Pinnell assessments, and teacher observations to determine literacy development goals and best  practices for using TC Writing and Reading, BrainPOP, and Rigby On Our Way in English  curriculum materials that will drive instruction and provide a solid literacy foundation for ELLs  in all curriculum areas.  The regular professional development meetings provide direct  professional development and support through "ENL strategy snapshots," which provides a  comprehensive and strong background in effective ENL teaching practices.  One integral  professional article utilized will be "Connecting Content and Academic Language for English  Learners and Struggling Students." by Ruth Swinney and Patricia Velasco.  iPad useage for  academic learning, Myon implementation, and readworks.org material professional development  is proivded as well.  Additionally, the P.S. 48 ELL Toolbox is in continual development, which  provides curricular resources and professional development information for the teachers in the  Title III Program.    Additionally, when offered, the Title III Program teachers will attend professional development  offerings provided by outside agencies, including network-based and NYCDOE DELLs  trainings, on an ongoing basis to build school capacity in meeting the needs of students  participating in the Title III Program.  Name of Provider  The school’s ENL Coordinator will be responsible for organizing the collaborative professional  development for the Title III Program teachers, based on the teachers collective needs,  reflections, and both their teaching and instructional observations of the students within the  program.  Each teacher within the Title III after school program will have shared ownership over  the professional development based on the needs of both the teachers and the students being  instructed in the program.

Additionally, the parent coordinator offers pertinent workshops that assist parents  of ELLs in improving the English language acquisition of the their children.  These programs  and invitations to the programs will be translated and interpreted as necessary into the pertinent  language of the parents in attendance.   These meetings include CookShop for Families, a  nutrition and literacy program for K-2 students, and their parents.  Parents will attend these  workshops to learn about healthy eating and literacy, and the School Pantry program, which will  build parental capacity as volunteers in the school community.  The program consists of multiple  workshops commencing in January and running once a month through the Spring of the school  year.  Parents will be notified by face-to-face contact, letters sent home, on the school calendar  and school monthly newsletter, and phone calls.  There are a total of 18 parental engagement  activity sessions.  Each session takes place for 2 hours to facilitate collaboration between parents  and school staff in attendance at the sessions.  Attendance (sign-in sheets) and agendas will be  kept on file by the parent coordinator.  The workshop schedule includes "Meet the Teacher," "The 10 Benefits of Being Bilingual,"  "Traditional Family Involvement/Non-traditional Family Involvement," "Attendance Meeting,"  "Dial A Teacher Orientation," "Writing Notebook for Parents," "Making the Transition to  Middle School," "CookShop for Families" (six monthly dates), "Parent Support Checklist,"  "Understanding the Common Core Learning Standards," "Early Child Development," "Test  Taking Tips," "Let Me Show You How Math Test Prep," and "Graduation Collaboration."  All  workshops are subject to change; however, parents will be notified in advance of any changes.  Parental interest and availability will be gauged through Parent Association (PA) meetings, in  person conversations and online surveys and digital communications tools (email, Remind app),  which afford accessibility in the language of the parents.  A key goal is to empower parents, who  within our school community, often feel that they are unable to support the academic and  language progress of their child.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 48 utilizes various assessment tools in order to comprehensively assess the development of English and Spanish literacy  skills of ELLs, including the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, Fountas and Pinnell, ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, and informal  conversations and rubric-based writing analysis. Utilizing various means of investigating students’ literacy foundation, along  with continual monitoring of progress, allows P.S. 48 to delve into individual students’ strengths and weaknesses to accelerate  English language development.  Teachers collect data from small group instruction, particularly in TC Writing and Ready GEN  reading.  Additionally, the school utilizes Envision 2.0 unit assessments.  The school utilizes these assessments to pinpoint       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      areas to provide scaffolding and support strategies for ELLs. These assessment tools are monitored and tracked regularly to  identify areas of improvement and reteaching to support and guide instructional planning for the ELLs.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We are able to provide small group and individual student instruction to students requiring similar instructional needs. We  have created school-based tracking tables to monitor English literacy acquisition, based on Fountas and Pinnell. We utilize  listening, speaking, reading, and writing NYSESLAT activities in order to develop preparation for the official NYSED NYSESLAT.  We track student academic progress with tables and graphs. This data provides multiple perspectives on ELL language  development. Through individual analysis and in collaborative settings, ENL and classroom teachers attempt to pinpoint 2016- 17 SCEP-FL 55 instructional agendas that provide students with instruction as required. P.S. 48 utilizes various assessment  tools in order to comprehensively assess the early literacy skills of ELLs, including NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, Fountas and Pinnell,  ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, and informal conversations and rubric-based writing analysis.    We amend lessons and units of study to adapt to the particular skills in which ELLs require additional supports. This data  analysis provides multiple insights into each individual student's strengths and weaknesses. Classroom teachers and the ENL  teachers uses this analysis to provide feedback and instructional next steps. We will focus on units of study and depth of  knowledge in order to deepen the understanding of content knowledge and develop literacy skills. Teachers collaborate to  develop rigorous tasks for the ELLs, differentiated for specific individual stages of language acquisition. In viewing the data we  have determined a critical component for targeted instruction. This is strengthening and deepening the development of  written language domains (reading and writing) in the content areas. This reflects shifts in student expectations connected to  the Common Core Learning Standards. Students develop a phonetic base of knowledge yet struggle to translate this  knowledge into a working comprehension of English reading and writing. Therefore targeted instruction focuses on the use of  English as a tool for communication for a purpose and audience. Common Core Learning Standards provide a foundation for  translating these assessments into usable instruction based on the students need mentioned above. In the end, the instruction  is driven by the students' individual areas of need in concert with Common Core Learning Standards objectives for each grade  level.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The coming two school years we will continue to foster an environment for ELLs that is conducive to ensuring that academic  English acquisition, and subsequently meet AYP goals for our ELLs.  Additionally we will ensure ELL learning continues to be  connected to the Common Core Learning Standard-aligned grade level content.  Focusing on the usage of the NYCDOE's ELL  Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) will allow us to provide specific targets for subgroups of ELLs.  Whole group and small group periods  of ENL instruction include integration with the content areas, along with targeted NYSESLAT preparation, will take place over  the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years.  These supports will also be afforded to the students who score at the  commanding level on the NYSESLAT for 2 subsequent years.  These students will remain in ENL homerooms in order to receive  transitional supports. P.S. 48x has made significant gains in reaching the ELL population.  Students are showing progress on the  NYSESLAT. P.S. 48x will continue to make do with the resources and time allotted.  We continue to be innovative in seeking on  effective approaches to addressing the learning needs of our ELLs.  We are fostering a deeper level of conversation with all  stakeholders in order to be better informed at ensuring the continued progress of all ELL students.     In addition to the usage of the EDAT Tool to measure annual progress and assess the programs for ELLs at PS 48, teacher and  parent feedback helps us modify and mold the program to be continually successful for the ELLs.  ENL Homeroom teachers fill  out surveys, as well has hold professional development workshops and discussions to inform the school community about  techniques and ideas that are successful, need amending, or may need to be abandoned.  Additionally they provide innovative  suggestions for implementation.  Additionally the ENL office maintains a bulletin board that provides space for various  stakeholders in ELL success the opportunity for adding ideas for change for future years.  Changes in core curriculum have  provided opportunities for looking at how we teach our ELLs in order to ensure that they continue to makes progress in  academic content as well as in English language acquisition concurrently.  Based on trends in NYSESLAT scores over the past       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      five years, our students continue to demonstrate consistent progress in developing English language usage.  Additionally, we  utilize the NYSESLAT scores to target specific areas of improvement in the programming offered at PS 48 for ELLs.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    This summative data analysis provides multiple insights that provide structures to address interventions into each individual  student's strengths and weaknesses.  Classroom teachers and the ENL teachers uses this analysis to provide feedback and  instructional next steps.  We will focus on units of study and depth of knowledge in order to deepen the understanding of  content knowledge and develop literacy skills.  Teachers collaborate to develop rigorous tasks for the ELLs, differentiated for  specific individual stages of language acquisition.  In viewing the data we have determined a critical component for targeted  instruction.  This is strengthening and deepening the development of written language domains (reading and writing) in the  content areas.

Therefore targeted instruction focuses on the use of English as a tool for communication for a purpose  and audience.  Common Core Learning Standards provide a foundation for translating these assessments into usable  instruction based on the students need mentioned above.  In the end, the instruction is driven by the students' individual  areas of need in concert with Common Core Learning Standards objectives for eachgrade level.  Additionally, it is evident that  a structured academic vocabulary approach through a holistic curriculum targeting science and social studies to impact literacy  development.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Response to Intervention (RtI) for ELLs has proven to be effective for addressing the particular needs of individual  students.  An RtI framework provides ELLs with rigorous, culturally responsive instruction.  As such, the PS 48 RtI framework  adds additional tiers of focused instructional supports.  Tier 1 addresses high quality evidence-based instruction that supports  our ELLs.  Tier II consists of enhanced targeted and intensive academic supports in small groups settings, both inside the  classroom and outside the classroom.  Tier III consists of highly targeted, intense academic intervention and progress  monitoring.  Tier II and Tier III interventions incorporate research-based intervention strategies that align to the individual  needs of P.S. 48's ELLs.  We utilize data longitudinally over the course of a school year (and longer) in order to identify students  who are not demonstrating progress based on grade-level monitoring and research-based methodologies into language  acquisition time frames.  We utilize Fountas and Pinnell, NYSESLAT, Mathematics chapter pre-test and post-tests, performance  tasks in the fall and spring of the school year, ELL Periodic Assessments, student work samples based on rubrics, and informal  observations of student progress. The school utilzes the ELL Policy and Reference Guide (EPRG) for guidance on ensuring that  ELLs receive RtI, based on the underlying data collected at the individual student level.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Through September 26, 2017, of the 2017-2018 school year, for the NYSITELL 30 students were eligible to be assessed.  Of  these 30 students identified as students with home languages other than English and eligible for the NYSITELL to determine  whether or not they required ENL supports, 2 (6.67%) scored at the commanding proficiency level. 19 students (63.33%)  scored at the entering proficiency level, 2 students (6.67%) scored at the emerging proficiency level, 4 students (13.33%)  scored at the transitioning proficiency level, and 3 students (10.00%) scored at the expanding proficiency level. 17 students  (56.67%) were in kindergarten, 3 students (10%) were in first, 3 students (10%) were in second grade, 3 students (10%) were in  third grade, and 1 student was in both fourth and fifth grade when first identified as new students who are ELLs. NOTE: The  school's ELL students are identified as having a home language other than English via the Home Language Identification Survey  (HLIS) and associated oral interview with the parent and child, alongside being assessed with the NYSITELL. Based on CCLS  academic demands, these students require intensive English instruction in the reading foundational skills, including phonics,  word analysis skills, and letter-sound identification.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         With additional time in an English school setting, students quickly progress to transitioning and expanding levels on the  NYSESLAT. During Spring 2017 NYSESLAT 121 current students in PS 48 were administered the NYSESLAT (this does not reflect  students in fifth grade during SY 2016-2017 who are now in sixth grade- which our school does not have).  8 students (7.92%)  of the students scored at the entering stage. 29 students (28.71%) scored at the emerging stage. 34 students (33.66%) scored  at the transitioning stage. 26 students (25.74%) scored at the expanding stage. 7 students (6.93%) scored at the commanding  stage. NOTE: 19 students: 4th graders last year and now 5th graders during SY2017-2018 do not have NYSESLAT scores, as of  9/27/17 due to scan errors, and are not included in this analysis of NYSESLAT data.  Thus the analysis is based off of 101  students who have NYSESLAT scores.    We utilize RLAT data and the EDAT to generate reports and analysis based on the NYSESLAT, NYS Mathematics and NYS  ELA exams.  We utilize this assessment data to evaulate and inform the ELL programs, groupings, targeted interventions, and  next steps.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) is foundational in assisting PS 48 in improving the instruction and academic outcomes for  ELLs and track progress to ensure achievement of proficiency of the ELLs, including AMAO targets for ELLs.  Additionally the  EDAT allows us to provide instructional shifts to adapt to the learning needs of the school's students.  EDAT analyzes student  home languages, grade level, years of receiving services as an ELL, performance and progress on ELA and mathematics  assessments, along with NYSESLAT proficiency data.  Additionally, the EDAT includes SIFE status and possible disabilities.  Student groupings are determined based on this data.  AMAO 1 focuses on the “percentage of students making progress in  English as determined by progress on the annual administration of the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test (NYSESLAT).” AMAO 2 focuses on the “percentage of students attaining English language proficiency,” also  measured on the annual administration of the NYSESLAT. PS 48 utilizes the EDAT to assist with the automatic estimation of  AMAOs 1 and 2. The tool allows schools to project their status through the 2017-2018 school year. This tool allows PS 48 to  utilize data from ATS reports, calculate AMAO 1 and 2 statuses, and project these statuses through the 2017-2018 school year.  The data yielded can easily be used to focus on the progress toward achievement of proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs,  and the design of effective instructional programs and/or interventions for those students. The factors that can be analyzed  include home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency and  progress, attendance, age, credit accumulation, holdover status, SIFE status, and disability classification. We identify best  practices in a manner that allows an inquiry approach to drive the investigation of our school’s ELL student achievement.  However, ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) prove difficult in providing predictions when the ELL population fluidly moves in and  out of the school throughout the school year, inhibiting the ability to meet AMAO goals. As the number of newcomer ELLs  increases within a given school year, the AMAO mandate associated with percentage of students scoring at the  commanding/proficient level on the NYSESLAT automatically decreases with no reflection upon the instruction provided to the  school’s ELLs. Nonetheless PS 48 utilizes the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to drive the school’s interest in meeting arbitrary  AMAO targets, and more essentially, ensuring the academic and social success of the school’s ELL students. PS 48 utilizes the  EDAT to analyze home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency  and progress, attendance, age, credit accumulation, holdover status, SIFE status, and disability classification.          Part IV: ELL Programming         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 48x has a blended model for instruction of English Language Learners.  This flexibility allows the school to  program services for ELLs in a targeted manner tailored to student needs.  As such beginners, or newcomers, receive  some periods of pull out instruction.  This is based on current research.  P.S.48x has few long term ELLs (more than six  years receiving English language services).  We strive to ensure that students demonstrate continual progress is  reaching English language proficiency within three years of schooling.  Still P.S. 48x provides every student entitled to  receive ENL services this instruction until they pass the NYSESLAT.  Students who become proficient in English, as  determined by the spring administration of the NYSESLAT, receive testing modifications for two additional school  years as ‘former ELLs,’ and placed in ENL homerooms, where possible, for another one to two school years in order to  provide transitional supports.  This additional year or two of transitional ENL supports ensures that the students  deemed proficient, based on the NYSESLAT, received continued instruction language supports as they deepen and  internalize the structures of English. These students continue to receive NYSED testing modifications that they are  eligible to receive while ELLs.    Entering and emerging proficiency level ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, in addition to English  Language Arts (ELA) instruction alongside their monolingual classmates.  Transitioning, Expanding, and commanding  (for two years) ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week, in addition to 180 minutes of English Language  Arts instruction.  ELA instruction utilizes reading and writing workshop models that develop comprehension, fluency,  and the writing process through TC Writing Project, all across multiple genres, aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards and NYS ELA standards.    Self-contained ENL classrooms and push in ENL classrooms are put together heterogeneously by looking at NYSITELL  and/or NYSESLAT levels. Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding proficiency ELL students provide links and  language models for newcomer ELLs, as well as assisting in providing native language supports.   ELL student needs,  informed by NYSESLAT modality levels (Reading/Writing and Listening/Speaking), determine which ENL homeroom to  place specific students on partticular grade.    Self-contained ENL Model: Students receive mandated CR Part 154 Instructional Unit Requirements for ELLs: 360  minutes for Entering and Emerging students, and 180 minutes for Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding  students by the classroom teacher who is certified or in the process or receiving certification in ENL. Differentiation,  scaffolding and thematic planning are always embedded on our school-wide curriculum which are the key ingredients  for a successful ENL classroom. Therefore, students who are learning English are already comfortable and exposed to  collaborative group work , thematic instructions through content areas i.e. social studies and science and oral  development lessons through songs, partner reading and writing, choral and echo reading and monthly grade  assembly performances when they were placed in an ENL self-contained classroom this school year. In a self- contained classroom, all instructions are done in English with scaffold in regards to students’ language levels based on  their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL. Newcomers in the class are grouped with someone who speak the same language like  them for cognitive and social-emotional support in the classroom.    Push In Model: The ENL certified teacher pushes into the classroom and co-teaches alongside the ENL homeroom  classroom teacher. During the push in period (typically 60 minutes a session, up to the total number of minutes  required weekly for each individual child based upon CR Part 154 Instructional Unit Requirements for ELLs: 360  minutes for Entering and emerging students, and 180 minutes for Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         students, a whole class mini-lesson occurs, after which the students are broken up into small groups for strategy work  based on student needs.  The whole class mini-lesson is usually co-taught, sometimes led by the classroom teacher  and sometimes led by the ENL push in teacher.    ENL Pull Out Model: groups are placed homogeneously where entering and emerging students requiring the same  language supports are placed in the same groups.  While difficult to accommodate student scheduling and other  mandated services, we strive to ensure an appropriate education setting conducive to effectively learning the English  language.  Groups are formed upon CR Part 154 Instructional Unit Requirements for ELLs: 360 minutes for entering  and emerging students, and 180 minutes for Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding. In addition to targeted and  tailored classroom supports for ELLs, P.S. 48x ensures that all students, including ELLs, have access to all school  programs.  Some of these programs include: Fall and spring school performances and talent shows, after school  programs sponsored by Police Athletic League (PAL), physical education programs, school-based gardening programs  in The South Bronx Schoolyard Garden and Outdoor Classroom, music program where students learn different  instruments, songs and participate in  school-wide concert performances, school nurse and CookShop nutrition  sessions.  ELLs are afforded the opportunity to be included in all activities of the school.  There is no differentiation  between non-ELL and ELL when determining student participation in school and community programs.    In order to make content learning comprehensible in mathematics, science, and social studies, P.S. 48x teachers make  concerted efforts to employ successful research based strategies and methodologies.  Specific strategies such as Total  Physical Response (TPR) and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) are utilized, alongside  technology and Internet resources for developing visual understanding of content concepts and hands on use of  manipulatives, realia, and objects pertaining to particular units of study.  We utilize the Rigby On Our Way to English  and Readers for Writers curriculum, as well as BrainPOP ESL and Imagine Learning.  A gardening program has been  developed to provide contextual basis for science learning.  See the program website at: http://sci-wiki- tific.wikispaces.com/Gardening.  Additional technologies that will assist ELLs in learning English, concurrently with  content knowledge and processes, include laptops,, iPads, SmartBoards digital storytelling, FLIP cameras, the  BrainPop suite (BrainPop, BrainPop Jr., and BrainPop ESL), and audio/visuals.   These tools will be utilized by the  students themselves in the various units of study.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     P.S. 48 currently does not have a sufficient number parent/guardians of students on contiguous grades to offer TBE  programming.  When the minimum threshold is met, the school will offer TBE programming.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      PS 48 is very excited to open a two way dual language (DL) Spanish-English program starting in the 2017-2018 school  year.  This school year the program is opening up in the kindergarten grade, and in subsequent school years, the  program will expand to first through fifth grades.  This is a new venture for the school, which has been awarded the  NYCDOE Dual Language Planning Grant.  We will be catching up to speed through professional development, inter  visitations, mentoring, and DOE visits.  Instead of having a year of planning to implement the program, we will  collaborate to implement and develop the program, in concert with each, to reflectively build the program.       Standalone and Integrated ENL supports are provided by the DL certified classroom teacher throughout the school  day to meet CR Part 154 mandates for minutes.  Students are strategically grouped based on assessment and progress  data and then grouped heterogeneously, across proficiency levels, to provide language models for  accelerating English language development.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   PS 48 utilizes STARS to program ELLs for mandated number of instructional minutes.  STARS, alongside ELL Data Update Report  (EDUR), which is received by the school each month, allows us to track and ensure that the ELLs receive their mandated  instructional minutes.    Students scoring at the Entering and Emerging English proficiency level on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL (if no NYSESLAT) receive  a minimum of 2 units of study (360 minutes) per week.  For students scoring at the Entering English proficiency level, this  included a minimum of 1 unit of study (180 minutes) of Stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of study in Integrated ENL/ELA (180  minutes) for a total minimum of 360 minutes per week.  For students at the Emerging English proficiency level, this includes at  minimum 0.5 units (90 minutes) of Stand-alone ENL, 1 unit (180 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ENL/ELA, and 0.5 units (90  minutes) of Integrated ENL/Content Area, for a total minimum of 360 minutes per week.  The EDAT informs the groupings and  instructional minutes served.     Students scoring at the Transitioning English proficiency level on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL (if no NYSESLAT) receive a  minimum of 0.5 units (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA and 0.5 units (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL/Content Area, for a  total minimum of 180 minutes per week.  The EDAT informs the groupings and instructional minutes served.     Students scoring at the Expanding English proficiency level on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL (if no NYSESLAT) receive a minimum  of 1 unit (180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA or other Content Area, for a total minimum of 180 minutes per  week.  The EDAT informs the groupings and instructional minutes served.     Former ELLs continue to receive 0.5 units of study (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ELA and/or Content Area (mathematics,  science, and social studies) depending on individual student needs, for an additional 2 years. Students are determined to be  former ELLs by one of two ways: a) Students scoring at the Commanding level on the prior school year administration of the  NYSESLAT; or b) or receive a 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment and at the Expanding English proficiency level on the NYSESLAT  (relevant for students in grades 3-5 in our school).   The EDAT informs the groupings and instructional minutes served.     Targeted grouping for ENL instruction takes place on no more than 2 contiguous grades, except for ELLs in special education  classes, to ensure the academic progress and English language development of the ELLs within our school.   The EDAT informs  the groupings and instructional minutes served.    In the DL program, the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided by the DL certified teacher, who additionally  provides HLA instruction to the ELLs.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In order to make content learning comprehensible in mathematics, science, and social studies, PS 48 teachers make  concerted efforts to employ successful research based strategies and methodologies.  These strategies ensure that language  development is fostered while addressing the demands set forth by the Common Core Learning Standards.  Specific strategies  such as Total Physical Response (TPR) and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) are utilized, alongside  technology and Internet resources for developing visual understanding of content concepts and hands on use of  manipulatives, realia, and objects pertaining to particular units of study.  We utilize the Rigby On Our Way to English and  Readers for Writers curriculum, as well as BrainPOP ESL to accent the core curriculum in literacy, ReadyGEN, and in  mathematics, Envision Math 2.0 and the the Five Principles of Mathematical Discussions.                 A gardening program has been developed to provide contextual basis for science and literacy learning.  See the program       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      website at: http://sci-wiki-tific.wikispaces.com/Gardening.  Additional technologies that will assist ELLs in learning English,  concurrently with content knowledge and processes, include laptops, iPads, SmartBoards digital storytelling, FLIP cameras, the  BrainPop suite (BrainPop, BrainPop Jr., and BrainPop ESL), and audio/visuals.   These tools will be utilized by the students  themselves in the various units of study.               Curriculum guidance comes from ongoing professional development in research based best practices in ENL teaching  methodologies. Additional pull out periods of instruction occur for beginning ELLs, along with special education students who  have IEPs mandating particular classroom settings that prohibit them for entering a general education ENL homeroom.  Careful  attention is paid to the ENL push in teachers’ schedules to ensure that students receive their mandated number of instruction  units (based on English proficiency level on the previous year’s NYSESLAT or LAB-R, for new admits) in accordance with  updated CR Part 154 regulations. Furthermore, Generation Ready and NTN Mathematics consultants are responsible for  providing materials and instructional support for the ELLs.                     The content areas, such as Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies are embedded into the units of study.  During regular  and ongoing weekly planning sessions, teachers collaborate in planning cross-curricular units, based on content areas  knowledge development that is infused in the Common Core Learning Standards in ELA and Mathematics, and following the  scope and sequence developed by the New York City Department of Education.  Content area instruction forms the core, or  hinge, of instruction, by providing concrete and authentic opportunities for developing English language skills across the  listening, speaking, reading, and writing strands by accessing the content knowledge the students already possess and/or are  required to possess.  Generation Ready and NTN Mathematics consultants are responsible for providing materials and  instructional support for the ELLs.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      These programs enhance the instruction and ensure native language supports for ELLs.  Native language evaluation occurs  through the use of the Spanish LAB for students whom the home language is Spanish.  Students utilize workbooks and texts  that are dual language.  Teachers and fellow students provide information in the native language.  Parents are encouraged to  foster the first language at home as a crucial component to effectively learning a second language, which in the case of PS 48,  is English.  A strong foundation in the home language affords enhanced transfer of skills and knowledge that allows easier  access to the second language.  The ENL program commences in September of every school year and continues through June  of every school year, maximizing the amount of ENL instructional time ELLs receive.  PS 48 will develop HLA assessment  tracking protocols for the DL program in collaboration with NYCDOE DELLS, who is supporting the school's DL program roll out  through the school's Dual Language Implementation Planning Grant that was awarded to the school in Spring 2017.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. SIFE  PS 48 infrequently receives SIFE students due to being an elementary school. Students enter either having attended school in  the home country, or, in the case of kindergarten and first grade students, have yet to commence the schooling process.  Yet  we prepare for their arrival in order to provide appropriate instruction immediately upon registration.  In order to effectively  teach students who are determined to be SIFE, we develop an understanding of their home culture in order to incorporate into  units of study.  Students begin with intensive receptive language development (listening and reading). We plan for potential  ELLs as part of the ENL teachers' continued professional development research, as well as classroom teachers of SIFE students,  into the cognitive,   academic, and social demands of SIFE students.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      B. Newcomer  Regarding newcomers, defined as ELLs who have been receiving English language instruction in the United States for less than  3 years, we begin instructional plans by looking at available data: NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell, Periodic  Assessments, informal teacher assessment, and NYSED testing program assessments.  From this base, students are placed into  appropriate classrooms in order to acquire and learn English.  These students learn through the classroom  curriculum.  Through TPR and sheltered-instruction model, we develop student-capacity for understanding the language and  grade specific content, and, based on Stephen Krashen’s research, transition   into productive skills utilizing comprehensible input just above where the student is able to function  independently.  Additionally we provide additional pull out periods for ENL services for these students utilizing school-based  “newcomer” lessons to assist students in adjusting to learning in our school. At the end of each school day these students  receive intensive English language supports in the ENL classroom.  The above strategies are utilized to improve the learning  outcomes for our newest ELLs.      C. Developing  We begin looking at pertinent student data: NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell, Periodic Assessments, informal  teacher assessment, and NYSED testing program assessments. This data is used to appropriately place ELLs into classroom,  where units of study are structured in order to enhance students’ ability to acquire and learn English.  These students learn  through the classroom curriculum.  Furthermore these students receive specific targeted small group instruction revolving  around the area of need, which necessitates the extension of services. We continue to use best practices, such as Through TPR  and sheltered-instruction model, we develop student capacity for understanding the language and grade specific content, and,  based on Stephen Krashen’s research,   transition into productive skills utilizing comprehensible input just above where the student is able to function  independently.  Individual student writing, reading, listening, and speaking needs are pinpointed.  We communicate student  strengths and weaknesses to these students so that they can target their learning development.  These students tend to be in  the push in program if they are general education students.  They are provided with vocabulary books to assist them,  Academic Intervention Services (AIS) as needed, and, in some cases, pull out ENL supports to target areas of academic need of  improvement based on RtI frameworks.  We examine NYS ELA, NYSESLAT, and Mathematics exams to target development,  should it be vocabulary, comprehension, writing   structure, and so forth.     D. Long Term  Available assessments, such as NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell, Periodic Assessment, informal teacher assessment,  NYS ELA, NYS Mathematics, performance tasks for each unit of study, and (if available) NYS Science, provide the foundation for  developing targeted instruction of long-terms ELLs.  Based on the data, we develop plans for these ELLs.  Particularly, if these  ELLs are not demonstrating progress on the NYSESLAT we have concerns about their language needs, utilize RtI  supports.  Many of these long-term ELLs are also ELL-SWD.  We employ and utilize IEP-based instructional goals for these  students with IEPs. We collaborate with classroom teachers to identify student needs and formulate units of study connected  to the classroom that addresses these English language learning needs.     E. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  Students who become proficient in English, as determined by the spring administration of the NYSESLAT, receive  testing modifications for two additional school years as ‘former ELLs,’ and are placed in ENL homerooms for another two  school years in order to provide transitional ENL supports.  This additional length of time of transitional ENL supports ensures  that the students deemed commanding, based on the NYSESLAT, received continued instruction language supports as they  deepen and internalize the structures of English. These students continue to receive NYSED testing modifications that they are  eligible to receive while ELLs. They receive 90 minutes (or 0.5 units) of ENL services each week.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs receive instruction based on their individual IEP, which informs us of the particular needs of our ELL-SWDs  population and ensures that all ELL-SWDs receive mandated services.  These ELL-SWDs receive instruction based on their  individual IEP.  These students tend to be spread out amongst various classes on varying grades, making it difficult for the ENL  teacher to push into their classrooms.  Instead, with articulation between the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher, English  language development is connected to classroom content in a pull out setting tailored to their English learning and IEP- based  learning needs. These students learn through the classroom curriculum.  The IEP assists the ENL teacher in determining  effective and expected language gains and   targeted areas of instruction.  PS 48 ensures that ELL-SWDs learn appropriate grade level material in preparation for NYS tests  in ELA and Mathematics.  In order to effectively ensure these students success, the ENL teachers utilize the Readers for  Writers curriculum in a pull out programs to deepen the foundation in English literacy. Specific grade level and  developmentally appropriate strategies are employed, such as Response to Intervention (RTI), Total Physical Response (TPR)  and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA), alongside technology and Internet resources for developing  visual understanding of content concepts and hands on use of manipulatives, realia, and objects pertaining to particular units  of study.  We utilize the Rigby On Our Way to English and Readers for Writers curriculum, as well as BrainPOP ESL with ELL- SWDs.  A gardening program has been developed to provide contextual basis for science learning.  See the program website at:  http://sci-wiki-   tific.wikispaces.com/Gardening.  Additional technologies that will assist ELL-SWDs in learning English, concurrently with  content knowledge and processes, include laptops, iPads, SmartBoards digital storytelling, FLIP cameras, the BrainPop suite  (BrainPop, BrainPop Jr., and BrainPop ESL), and audio/visuals.   These tools will be utilized by the students themselves in the  various units of study.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment, in consultation with the school-based support  team, these students participate in the full school program, from the arts and music, physical education, social studies, science,  mathematics and literacy.  Modifications based on the IEP and classroom settings are provided where needed. The goal is to  remain inclusive of all students within the school community.  Scheduling of students services affords flexibility.  Class and  individual students programs are based on student schedules for lunch and related services.       Additionally we utilize the SESIS online system.  This report enables us to know if a child comes into the school needs  language services and we can seamlessly provide the services from the beginning of the student's entry into the school.  We  look at individual student IEPs to make sure that they receive the appropriate IEP-mandated instruction necessary for the  success of the student.      PS 48 assigns alternate bilingual placement paraprofessionals for children with IEPs mandating bilingual instruction.  This way  the individual student receives the bilingual services needed in order to fully participate in the school experience, develop  academic language, and strengthen the use of the native language.  In addition, students receiving an alternate bilingual  placement paraprofessional receive ENL services by a NYS certified ENL teacher.  PS 48, in this manner, ensures that ELL-SWDs  accelerate in English language development.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs receive targeted intervention through Academic Intervention Services (AIS), small group instruction, RtI, and peer-to-peer  assistance in English Language Arts.   ELLs receive targeted intervention through Academic Intervention Services (AIS), small  group instruction, RtI, and peer-to-peer assistance in Mathematics.  ELLs receive targeted intervention through Academic  Intervention Services (AIS), small group instruction, RtI, and peer-to-peer assistance in Social Studies.  ELLs receive targeted       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70      intervention through Academic Intervention Services (AIS), small group instruction, RtI, and peer-to-peer assistance in Science.  Students are provided, as needed, with bilingual dictionaries and access to translation programs.  These interventions are in  English, with native language supports.  Students with native language supports also utilize native speakers of their language  for peer-to-peer assistance.  Multiple instructional strategies are utilized to facilitate appropriate curriculum and language  development.  The Common Core Learning Standards form the basis for instructional plans for all ELLs.  Using Common Core  grade benchmarks, assessment results on the NYSESLAT and ELL Periodic Assessments, we connect to academic content  required in grades K-5 in ELA, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science.  PS 48 analyzes student data on available exams in  ELA, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science to better inform the academic language development needs of ELLs.  PS 48  curriculum maps, aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, help guide instruction.  PS 48 attempts to make students  accountable for their own learning.  To that end, the school ensures that students understand what language needs they have  and consult with students regarding what they believe need additional assistance in learning.  Supports are in the native  language, if possible, as well as English.     Context is essential to language development.  PS 48 ensures the ELLs learn through units of study that emphasize an end of  unit goal, providing purpose and motivation for learning content and language.  Lessons incorporate all four language strands  using a variety of strategies and supports. Connections are made to the native language and culture whenever possible to  provide links and pathways for learning English.  ENL teachers use native language vocabulary to provide examples and foster  the use of the native language amongst students to provide scaffolding and supports.  In this way, students are provided with a  means of maintaining their native language.  PS 48 strives to encourage students to see their native language as a resource to  be drawn upon as they learn English.  Whenever possible, Total Physical response (TPR) activities, realia, and hands on use of  science (magnifying lens, rocks, animals, etc.), social studies (maps, money, and songs) and literacy materials foster language  development.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will be investing professional development time on aligning the curriculum in a coherent manner that ensures ELLs are  successful in ELA, math, science, and social studies content.  Additionally we are implementing improved cohesion within  curricular units of study aligned vertically and horizontally throughout the school to deepen student knowledge and make  relevant connections that foster accelerated English language growth.  This implementation is occurring in concert with the  Common Core Learning Standards.  Furthermore, we continue to develop our understanding and implementation of Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) levels and rubrics for ELLs.  These tasks require thoughtful implementation to accommodate the unique  challenges embedded in learning a new language (L2) concurrently with the requirement of learning content in the L2.      Additionally, the school will focus on fostering the development of bilteracy in Spanish and English through the development  of a two way dual language program.  The program will commence in the 2017-2018 school year in kindergarten and expand to  grades 1-5 in subsequent years.  We anticipate one class per grade becoming DL, which will address parental interest in  bilteracy instruction for their children.      Furthermore, the school will be looking at providing more Spanish literacy assessments and materials, including curriculum and  reading books, to support home language instruction in the classrooms and at home.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We did not discontinue any major programs/services for ELLs. If possible we look forward to utilizing Title III funding for  additional after school programming that targets the ELLs specifically.  We have tried to enhance programs, even though  budgetary constraints have limited our ability to do as such.  However we continue to seek smart solutions to ensuring the  most effective instruction for ELLs with the resources provided.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  PS 48 operates under an integrated programmatic student schedule.  This entails all students across all grades and in all  classroom settings and restrictions participating completely in the full school schedule and programming.  ELLs participate  alongside monolingual English speakers in the Arts, Physical Education and Health, Music, Drama, Science, Social Studies,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      Ballroom Dancing, Dance, Foodbank of New York's CookShop Classroom, Technology, Library, and Band  programs.  Additionally all ELLs are afforded an opportunity to participate in field trip experiences, school performances, the  Hunts Point Slave Burial Ground Project, service learning opportunities such as The Daffodil Project, and after school sports  and academic programs sponsored by the Police Athletic League (PAL) and City Year.  There is no differentiation between ELL  and non-ELL when it comes to programming and/or selecting students to participate in activities.  This inclusive practice  ensures that every student develops cultural understanding through our culturally relevant pedagogy.  When the programs are  developed, English language learning does not play a prohibitive role in the decision process.  In essence, each student and  each class is viewed as requiring these essential components of a well-rounded education.  To that end, we carefully address  the social, emotional, and academic needs of ELLs as they participate in the program offerings of the school.      After School and Supplemental Services for ELLs:   Title III funding affords P.S. 48x with the ability to specifically target ELLs for supplemental services.  This occurs through small  group instruction and after school programming.  The goal of these programs is to accelerate English language learning  through a hands on, thoroughly engaging learning experience.   By connecting environmental literacy with English language  learning, ELLs develop an end product in the target language of English.  Each school year, the project changes, based on  student age, grade, language needs, and teacher participation.  Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing activities are  incorporated around a central theme in life sciences.  The program embeds language learning in the context of content  development.  Additionally ELLs participate in the Police Athletic League (PAL) after school program and The Point's diverse  after school activities.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Multiple strategies and materials are utilized across ELL subgroups for specific targeted purposes depending on the goal of any  particular unit of study or individual daily lesson’s key objectives.  These include the following materials and strategies.      Total Physical response (TPR) activities, realia, and hands on use of science (magnifying lens, rocks, animals, etc.), social studies  (maps, money, and songs) and literacy materials foster language development.  Additionally we use storytelling, singing songs  and poems, role-play scenarios, plays and skits, oral presentations, and group projects that facilitate authentic language use  within a specific unit of study. Embedded grammar and mechanics instruction, with small mini-lessons develop confidence and  fluency.  In listening, many of the same activities utilized for speaking development are used as well.  The ENL teachers devise  speaking and listening activities in such a way that the speaking activity provides a context for listening and vice versa.  When  one student or group of students presents orally, the rest of the group is responsible for listening.  Strategies are emphasized  for making the oral presentation comprehensible as a listener, such as learning about visual cues and writing notes in graphic  organizers.  Additionally students listen to books read aloud, on CD/cassette tape, and on the computer with visual  aids.  Oftentimes reading and writing activities are connected to these activities as well, based on students’ proficiency levels  in the 4 language modalities. In reading, students are exposed to multiple genres throughout the school year, including non- fiction (i.e. magazines, books, newspapers, advertisements, textbooks) and fiction (i.e. poems, fairy tales, folktales, myths,  plays).  Visual cues, realia, and front-loading of vocabulary ensure that students are successful at comprehending written  text.  P.S. 48x starts instruction for beginner ELLs with texts that are picture-based and concerning tangible, accessible  topics.  Slowly these supports are dropped as students develop their reading skills (such as comprehension, fluency, vocabulary  development, and decoding).  Additionally, components of Reading Workshop, such as Shared Reading and Independent  reading provide modeling of appropriate reading strategies.      The ENL teacher ensures that reading and writing language modalities are connected to each other, and to listening and  speaking (sharing with others about the text that the student read or listened to, orally reading the writing piece to others,  asking questions of classmates).  Particular focus on the Writing Workshop mini-lessons modeled by the ENL teacher and  classroom teacher provide exemplary models of strong writing.  Small group strategy-based groupings within the classroom  challenge ELLs to develop their writing mechanics, academic vocabulary (CALP), paragraph structure, and grammar.  Genre  studies, author studies, and character studies provide deep levels of understanding.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72         Specific technologies include Additional technologies that will assist ELLs in learning English include laptops, iPads, FLIP  cameras, the BrainPop suite (BrainPop, BrainPop Jr., and BrainPop ESL), SmartBoards, and audio/visuals.  These technologies  will be used to instruct ELLs, but more importantly enhance students’ learning experience.  These tools will be utilized by the  students themselves in the various units of study.  Technology implementation through the use of Smart Boards, iPads, voice  recorders, and digital storytelling provide high interest avenues for developing all language modalities.  ENL teachers attend  specific professional development sessions in maximizing the Smart Board for lessons, re-teaching, and independent language  activities.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Development of one’s first language (L1) is essential to second language (L2) acquisition and development. Beverly A. Clark’s  paper (http://ceep.crc.uiuc.edu/pubs/katzsym/clark-b.pdf), “First- and Second-Language Acquisition in Early Childhood” details  this essential necessity by stating, “…continued first-language development is related to superior scholastic  achievement.  When children do not have many opportunities to use language and have not been provided with rich  experiential base, they may not learn to function well in their second language, and at the same time, they may not continue  to develop their first language” (184). She cites the research by the following individuals: Collier, 1995a; Grosjean, 1982;  Krashen, 1996; McLaughlin, 1984.  To that end, P.S. 48 ensures first and foremost that the home school connection continues  through validating the home language.  During parent orientations, parents are encouraged to foster, develop, and connect  the home language to the content and language learned at P.S. 48 and within the community.  Over 21% of the school  population is ELLs, with many more whose home language is not English.  We view this as an asset.  In the classroom setting,  students are encouraged to communicate in the first language when needed, and when relevant, provided glossaries and  classroom texts in the native language. Key concepts are provided in the native language in order to front-load the content  material being examined.  We ensure that the native language is valuable to the school and provide digital and hard copy  resources in Spanish.      Within the DL program, we will be exploring materials and assessments to deliver research based best  practices to support the home language and English acquisition concurrently.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Every ELL at PS 48 enters their initial grade level of instruction based on their age level.  We follow NYCDOE guidelines when it  comes to first time registration and promotion of ELLs.  The guidelines adhered to by PS 48 are CR A-501: parts IV, V, VI, and  attachment number 1. Limited English proficiency alone is not the basis for retention. This means that student age determines  first time entrants’ placement in a class at PS 48.  Promotion criteria for newcomer ELLs (two years or less) are based on a  holistic examination of each child’s academic progress, not solely on English language development.  This includes such criteria  in addition to ENL, mathematics, science, arts, and social development.  English language development takes time, and as such,  should not be the sole criterion for promotional determinations.  ELLs receive age and grade appropriate instruction through  relevant classroom curricular materials in ENL, literacy, mathematics, science and social studies.  Required services and  supports are based on ELLs' age and consequently grade level.  Appropriate developmental activities start with an  understanding of what is expected of students at particular ages.  We utilize the Common Core Learning Standards to ensure  that the academic rigor of instruction aligns with our educational priorities.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 48 does not share a building.  However we collaborate with neighboring schools, including PK and middle schools to ensure  the foundations for learning English are supported before and after leaving PS 48.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students and families that register prior to the first day of school receive orientations on how the school works.  This ensures  that parents and children are comfortable with the learning environment, provides parents with opportunities to discuss  particular concerns, and begins the transition process for the newly admitted student into the school environment.  During the  school year, activities include participation in school performances, music programs, garden programs, CookShop Classroom       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      (depending on the class and grade level), Hunts Point Slave Burial Ground Project, physical education, newcomer ENL Club at  the end of the school day, and after school programs offered through the Police Athletic League (PAL) and City Year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently PS 48 does not offer language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    P.S. 48 has decided to pilot a Dual Language program on the Kindergarten level in Fall 2017 and monitor  the implications it might have on student progress across the content areas. This is the beginning of a roll  out over the next 6 years in order to create a DL program on each grade level with one class per grade  being dual language. The school has been awarded the NYCDOE Dual Language Implementation Planning  Grant, including $20000 for supporting the development of a program.   In collaboration  with NYCDOE DELLS, who is supporting the school's DL program roll out, through one of the DELLSS' dual  language consultants.  We will receive guidance on effective instructional practices, budget, program  material purchases, program design, and parental/community involvement practices.  Although the grant  is for planning during the 2017-2018 with a program roll out in Fall 2018, PS 48 will begin the program, as  well as plan, reflect, and build best practices and school personnel capacity for implementing a successful  DL program.  The school will utilize the DELLSS' "Checklist of Model Dual Language Enrichment Programs"  to guide the process.  Our school will determine ELL eligibility through the NYSITELL (and thus the Spanish  home language students for the program).  For English home language students, school staff will be  trained to interview proficiency in English.      The DL program is two way dual language program that is self-contained where half the students have a  home language of Spanish who will deepen their Spanish literacy skills (speaking, listening, reading,  writing, and visual literacy) while learning English in an academic setting.  Concurrently, the other half of  the students have an English home language, and will build on their English skills to develop Spanish- English bilteracy.  The program is a commitment on the behalf of PS 48 for the school  community.  Families commit to ensuring that their child maintains participation in the program in  subsequent years to build and deepen literacy skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing, and visual  literacy) in both languages.  One classroom teacher is responsible for instruction in both languages.    Core content in taught in both Spanish and English, including literacy, mathematics, social studies, and  science curriculum.  Curriculum is aligned to CCLS and NYCDOE pacing charts, utilizes TC Writing, Ready  GEN literacy, and Envision Math 2.0 materials, that are augments by supplemental materials, including  dual language texts that support phonics, comprehension, vocabulary, and content development in both  languages.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74         Each language is separated on a daily basis, across the core content curriculum areas.  Alternating days  are Spanish or English instruction, and as such all whole class instruction on a given day is in only one  language (either Spanish or English).  Small group instruction reinforces the particular day's language  instruction as well as support students in the home language (particularly if the home language is not the  targeted instructional language of the day).  both languages are afforded equal time for instruction, as  this is a 50-50 model.    Both Spanish and English will be taught simultaneously throughout the school year.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our school’s professional development plan ensures that our ELL students receive effective instruction.  We provide teachers  with research based language acquisition and content development professional development that is tailored specifically to  the needs of our school’s ELLs, including co-teaching strategies, and integrating language and content instruction.  This  includes a targeted 15% of school’s total hours of professional development in ELL-specific areas of focus for all teachers  within the school.  Additionally, teachers of ENL receive 50% of their professional development in ELL-specific areas of  focus.  The professional development plan includes sessions developed collaboratively by school staff, outside organizations  and institutions, including, but not limited to the New York City Department of Education’s Department of English Language  Learners (NYCDOE DELLS), Fordham University, and the United Federation of Teachers (UFT).  Teachers maintain their own  records of their 175 hours of professional development.  PD topics include language proficiency levels and the specific learning  needs of students at this level; identification process, co teaching strategies, integrating content, vocabulary development,  content area supports, and cross cultural understanding.  Professional development is conducted on a continual basis every  Monday that school is in session.  This long term plan builds on previous weeks to deepen the understanding of the academic  learning and second language acquisition needs of ELLs.  The overarching themes for the yearlong professional development  align to CCLS Mathematics and English Language Arts expectations, with investment in deeply looking at scaffolds and  differentiations for ELLs across all language proficiency levels.  PS 48 understands that the more informed the entire school staff is regarding the instructional need of ELLs, the more  successful our ELL population will be.  To that end, all staff receives professional development in both formal and informal  ways on a continued basis throughout each school year. Professional development for instruction of ELLs includes the  following personnel: principal, assistant principals, ENL coordinator and ENL teachers, common branch, special education, and  content coverage (prep) teachers, paraprofessionals, counselors, secretaries, SETTS teachers, and the parent coordinator.  It is  essential that all staff understand the unique learning needs of ELLs, along with the attached social-emotional supports  required to nurture their social and academic development. On any given day each week of school PS 48 holds grade level  meetings.  In these collaborative meetings, teachers, staff developers, and administrators work together to deepen  pedagogical practices, often utilizing NYCDOE ELL Briefs.  During these meetings, the unique needs of the ELL population are  discussed, in relationship to the expectations of all students derived from the Common Core Learning Standards. Additionally,  on Mondays and Tuesday vertically integrated teams of teachers provide professional development to their colleagues.  The  overarching themes for the yearlong professional development align to CCLS Mathematics and English Language Arts  expectations, with investment in deeply looking at scaffolds and differentiations for ELLs across all language proficiency levels.     Professional development during these meetings consists of exploring the stages of language acquisition, the various language  based tasks relevant to students at any particular stage, understanding the social and emotional context for learning a new  language, communicating with parents, state and city regulations regarding services to ELLs, how to assess ELL student work       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      and academic growth.      Both pedagogical and non-pedagogical staff will receive information about our school’s program offerings, the basic concept  and theory behind best practices in ELL instruction and the Common Core Learning Standards.  Additionally the school-based  staff receives professional development in the New York State Education Department LEP identification process.  School staff  becomes familiar with the identification and the NYS testing program as it pertains to ELLs. The pupil secretary, in particular,  receives ongoing professional development in ATS screens pertinent for the proper placement of new admit and transfer  ELLs.  Classroom teachers with ELLs receive articles and lessons pertinent to meeting the literacy development needs of the  ELLs.  In particular, we are focusing on developing our curriculum as we adapt to implementation of ReadyGEN and Envision  2.0 math curriculum.     An integral component of the professional development program hinges on the collaboration of classroom teachers and the  ENL teachers.  The professional development that occurs in these meetings is then turn-keyed to the rest of the school staff  (assistant principals, classroom and content teachers, and paraprofessionals) during collaborative common planning meetings  that take place every week.  During these meetings ENL professional development information is discussed to coordinate our  instructional programs and share information on such issues as best practices in second language acquisition, ENL instruction,  and testing accommodations for ELLs. Best research based strategies for ENL, ELA, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and  the Arts.  Professional development involves vocabulary development, grammar development, oral language development,  test preparation, interacting with parents of ELLs, and using realia.  Administration will also ensure that each staff member is  aware of the materials and information available regarding ELL instruction in our school.      Planning sessions incorporate the use of Rigby ELL Assessments to determine literacy goals and also use Rigby On Our Way ESL  curriculum program, as well as Readers to Writers, to drive instruction and provide a solid literacy foundation for ELLs across  the curriculum.  Each session provides direct professional development and support through “ENL strategy snapshots,” which  provide classroom teachers with a strong background in ENL teaching best practices. Additionally, ENL teachers and ENL  homeroom teachers will attend professional development offerings provided by local colleges and universities, as well as the  NYCDOE Office of ELLs trainings, to build school capacity in meeting the needs of ELL students.  In this manner, classroom  teachers develop a repertoire of skills for teaching ELLs that they can utilize throughout the school year.  This targeted capacity  building additionally ensures that all school staff understands the unique learning challenges facing ELLs and all staff becomes  equipped to providing a productive learning environment for all students developing listening, speaking, reading, and writing  skills in English.       PD agendas and sign in sheets will be maintained by the school administration.  The planned topics include ELL supports and  differentiation in the following areas (through November, along with a proposal for a study group for teachers of ELLs):  *5 Practices of Orchestrating Mathematical Discussions  *TC Writing   *iReady Training  *Fundations (K-2)  *Components of Balanced Literacy  *Envision Math 2.0            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76         Teacher teams meet and host professional development for their colleagues on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The Language  Allocation Coordinator (LAC) and ENL ensure that 15% of the school year’s year long PD plan includes topics pertinent to the  academic success of ELLs.  Topics will includ language proficiency levels and the specific learning needs of students at this level;  identification process, co-teaching strategies, integrating content, vocabulary development, content area supports, and cross  cultural understanding.  Additionally, teams of teachers of ELLs meet so that 50% of their PD time focuses on tasks that  accelerate the acquisition of English. The school’s administration  team maintains binders that contain meeting agendas and  minutes.  The school continually references the most updated version of the ELL Policy and Reference Guide (EPRG) for  support in ensuring professional development address pedagogical practices that best support the learning needs for ELLs.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 48 utilizes ATS reports to identify and verify all ELLs and former ELLs in order to host individual conferences with the  parents/guardians of each ELL and former ELL.  This meeting is in addition to the regularly scheduled parent conferences held  four times a year.  These annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs discuss and review the goals of the PS 48 program  offerings for students learning English as a New Language, language development progress, language proficiency assessment  results, and language development needs in all content areas.  A spreadsheet database is developed with these students that  tracks the annual individual meetings with the parent/guardians of these students.  The parents are invited to have the annual  individual meeting and a sign in sheet is gathered.  These annual individual meetings are then recorded in the spreadsheet  database.  Licensed pedagogues host the meetings on an ongoing basis, and interpretation/translation services are provided  by school staff and the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.  PS 48 maintains a database each year of school personnel  who serve as a resource for communicating in languages other than English.  We identify the parents’ preferred language of  communication ahead of each meeting in order to ensure the annual individual conferences connect the families to the PS 48  school community.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parental involvement is strongly encouraged and fostered at PS 48.  Staff developers and the Parent Coordinator throughout  the school year offer multiple workshops.  Bilingual translation and interpretation services are provided, guided by the school’s  Language Interpretation and Translation Plan.  Written communication, face-to-face meetings, and phone calls ensure that  parents are informed of their child’s academic and social progress.  However, P.S. 48x seeks to develop more parental  involvement, both in the number of parents involved, and the level of commitment parents provide.  It is difficult to recruit  parents on a continued basis for workshops, based on parental needs.  Additionally, we are exploring more efficient means of  communication with parents to ensure a more effective parental involvement base for organizing the P.S. 48x school  community.                    Some of the programs that include parental involvement are CookShop for Families, Parent Association meetings, Pre-K family  workshops, School Leadership Team participation, Hunts Point Slave Burial Ground Project, and school wide fundraising  activities.  CookShop for Families is a program sponsored by the Food Bank for New York City designed to promote nutritional  literacy through hands on experiences.  Parents and children cook healthy foods together as they develop language skills.  The  parent coordinator, in consultation with the ELL coordinator, conducts this program.  The Parent Association provides open  meetings for parents to advocate for the academic and social betterment of the school family body.  Pre-K family workshops  assist parents in developing parenting skills, literacy developments, and fostering the home-school connection.  School  Leadership Team participation provides parents with the ability to gain the knowledge of school wide initiatives and leadership  concerning school wide goals.  School wide fundraising activities such as book fairs, picture day, and candy drives led by parent  initiative assist parents in becoming part of the P.S. 48x community.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Our school actively supports teachers in obtaining National Board Certification.  To that end, currently we have two Nationally  Board Certified Teachers of English as a New Language (ENL) on staff and continually encourage school teacher leaders to pursue  national certification.  Additionally we support locating cost effective ways for school staff to become ENL, bilingual, and dual  language certifications through opportunities within the NYCDOE, local institutions for higher learning, and outside organizations.                             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dwayne D'Avilar, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 48: Joseph Rodman Drake                                                                              School DBN: 08X048  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 48 uses various tools in order to ascertain the written translation and oral interpretation needs for the school  community, particularly our parent/guardians. The parent coordinator plays an active role in ensuring that  parents receive communication in their primary language. Parental and student home languages are identified  immediately upon entrance to the school. For new admits to the school, parents fill out the Home Language  Identification Survey (HLIS) in consultation with trained school staff. The HLIS is provided in the eight most  common primary languages other than English spoken by people living in New York City, as laid out in Chancellor’s  Regulation A-663. This ensures that every parent has the ability to accurately communicate to school staff the  languages utilized at home and guides P.S. 48 on how to best communicate with the parents. Additionally, we       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81      conduct informal conversations with the parents to assess the primary language of use. P.S. 48 regularly uses ATS  to verify home language trends within the school in order to best accommodate the written translation and oral  interpretation needs of parents and guardians. Furthermore, P.S. 48 utilizes ATS Report of Preferred Languages,  Blue Card data, Parent Surveys, and Teacher Survey information.   For students who are currently enrolled in P.S. 48 for more than one school year, school staff and the parent  coordinator meet collaboratively to discuss trends in primary home language. This continual process is conducted  through accessing ATS reports on students’ primary home languages, and if need be in particular cases, accessing  student cumulative files. Hence, P.S. 48 is able to meet the written translation and oral interpretation needs of  the school community.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Additionally, all schools staff have been provided  with information on using Language Line in the case of an Emergency. It is a toll free number that provides over the  phone interpretation for school staff in over 200 languages. Furthermore, we will be adopting the Remind app to  provide digital communication to families via text messages and emails that will be translated into the preferred  language of the families within our school community.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Language Access Coordinator or assistant principal will turnkey information on language access to all staff in the  following ways:      1. All staff receive an email that has attached the flyer for accessing the Language Line.   2. All staff receives a hard copy of the Language Line flyer in their mailbox.    3. All staff receive an email that provides directions on accessing, via the NYCDOE Intranet, the DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit services for translating materials in languages other than Spanish and English.   4. All staff receive a had copy that details directions on accessing, via the NYCDOE Intranet, the DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit services for translating materials in languages other than Spanish and English.   5.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      P.S. 48 fulfills Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services. The school has downloaded the available interpretation services signs in the  eight most common primary languages other than English spoken by people living in New York City. Signs are posted  in the main office, at the entrance to the parent coordinator’s office, and at the main entrance to the school. Along  with providing school staff with information on the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s “Translation Resources”  webpage, CDs of the available signs are provided to key school staff, including the principal, pupil secretary, parent  coordinator, and ENL Coordinator. Parents are made aware of their right and ability to receive information in their  primary language. For the primary language of Spanish, school staff provides both written translation and oral  interpretation services on an ongoing basis, during both formal and informal meetings and conferences.

Translation and  Interpretation Unit contact information is readily distributed on materials throughout the school community.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent Association meetings, School Leadership Team meetings, and individual conferences with parents provide  feedback from parents on the services required. Additionally, we utilized ATS data to determine preferred languages  of communication (written and orally) to drive and anticipate the needs of the parents. Furthermore we access the  data contained in the parent survey to view trends and adapt our school offerings and languages utilized to ensure  that parents remains connected to the school community irrespective of language and mode of communication.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87
