This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement and Values    Section 4: CEP Overview      Mission Statement:    Mission   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our goal is to create a network of inspired and empowered thinkers who are able to communicate their ideas in  various ways. With strategic instruction, caring support, and consistent guidance, children will graduate from P.S.  536 as passionate, independent students with strong academic and social emotional skills and a commitment to  advocate for themselves and for their community.    Values:    Collaboration -Our school community believes we are all learners and leaders. Parents lead workshops with    students, teachers work across grades to surround individual students with support, support staff and Community  Based Organizations join together to create and maintain a culture of excellence and peace.   Diversity -Each child is treated as an individual and given the support needed to succeed. Teachers are encouraged  to explore their assets and provide the time and training they need to teach effectively and work with each other  to build a community of inquiry, learning, and discovery. Students are engaged in their own education and held  accountable for meeting individual, personal goals.   Social Responsibility -We all have a responsibility to ourselves and each other as global citizens. We are committed  to diversity and social justice through active engagement and public works of service.   Creative Expression- We believe in innovation in teaching and learning through a project based curriculum. Field  trips foster experiences and shared language, and the visual, dramatic, musical and physical arts are part of our  core curriculum. Learning can be, and should be fun as well as rigorous.          2.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths:     Across grades and all subjects, including the Arts, the school analyzes student data to develop core curriculum tasks  so that individual and groups of students are cognitively engaged as evidenced in their written and oral responses and  group work. The school purposefully infuses English language learner (ELL) and Students with Disabilities (SWD)  teaching strategies within the curricula, such as emphasizing academic vocabulary in writing and speaking, using texts  that engage diverse learners within all lessons, and sets expectations that all student will learn the same curricula. For  example, in SWD classes the curricula includes scaffolding techniques using leveled texts, differentiated tasks, and  lengthened time on task. As a result of the school's ensuring that curricula are aligned to CCLS and content standards,  students including Ells and SWDs produce high levels of work which can be seen in the high caliber of writing and  work products that promote college and career readiness (2013-2014 SQR)   Needs:     In April 2018, approximately 23% of testing grade students scored a level 3/4 on the ELA exam, and approximately  21% scored a level 3/4 on Math.    General education students in 4th grade did not make adequate progress on the ELA exam. This will be a focus  subgroup for the 2017-2018 school year.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.    By May, 2019, 46% of all students in grades K-2 will be reading at or above grade level as measured by Fountas &  Pinnell reading assessment and 32% of students in grades 3-5 will score a level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA exam.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).     PS 536 will utilize data trackers in both ELA & Math to   monitor for progress in student learning, analyze trends,  and modify instruction based on the data. We will reate  systems to using student work and data to create tasks  and adapt curriculum so that that individual and groups  of students, including the lowest- and highest-achieving  students, ELLs, and SWDs, have access to the curricula  and tasks and are cognitively engaged (1.1& 2.2)     Ensure that our curriculum is aligned to CCLS by using  standards-based rubrics, resulting in coherence across  grades (1.1)     Develop and share a “vision for effective instruction” so   that teaching practices are aligned to the school’s  mission and reflect a coherent set of beliefs about how  students learn best that is informed by the Danielson  Framework (1.2)     Create teacher team protocols to ensure that student   work products and discussions reflect high levels of  student thinking, participation, and ownership (1.2 &  2.2)   Students with Disabilities will be placed in the least restrictive  environment whenever possible to ensure their access to a  rigorous and engaging curriculum –this includes flexible  scheduling and push in service. English Language Learners will be  exposed to academic and social language in classrooms and their  language acquisition will be supported by specialized programs  (Imagine Learning) and trained bilingual and ENL teachers. In  order to create a collaborative    environment and to build trust, we will meet twice a month as    Departments (vertical Special Ed or Bilingual) to discuss best  practices and share ideas.

Strengths:     All teachers like participating in on site PD as noted through schoolwide surveys.     All staff attend weeklong summer retreat in addition to weeklong summer curriculum planning and PBIS planning  sessions.    Priority Needs:     We will focus on 3rd and 4th grade SWDs& ELLs in ELA as a targeted subgroup. Only 10% of these groups scored a  level 3/4 on last years ELA assessment.    Professional Development needs to be differentiated based on needs noted in Advance observations, grade level,  content area focus, and/or subgroup needs of class.    All professional development will be differentiated this year. We will provide the space and time for all pedagogues to  provide and to participate in in-house professional development according to their specific professional grade level  goals.

Strengths: As stated in our Quality Review:      The leadership and staff have a clear vision of school improvement that includes focused school level goals and action  plans informed by data analysis that results in better teacher practice and improved student work. (3.1)    The principal effectively involves the community in academic and social activities, and students, faculty and staff share  a vision of individual and school improvement. The school’s focus on college and career readiness is evident by  prioritizing writing throughout the content areas. In addition, the school has developed goals and action plans that  are driving efforts to accelerate student learning by targeting reading levels, academic vocabulary acquisition, and  effective questioning, to elicit higher-order thinking across all grades. Professional development is structured to  address the attainment of these instructional school goals during the varied teacher team meetings as evidenced in  weekly agendas. As a result, reading levels have improved significantly based on last year's data and student writing  which is tracked every month shows marked and steady improvements across all grades. Students and families are  engaged in developing school and student goals as the theory of action includes parent input on all levels of school  decisions. The school informs parents weekly about their children's progress using data from class and benchmark  assessments including unit exams, weekly tests, and student writing. The leadership and teachers have formed a very  close relationship with families by including them in the development of school goals and action plans which was  corroborated by all the parents interviewed during the Quality Review process.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  PS 536 ensures that all teachers fully licensed and assigned to their license area. In addition, PS 536 develops teacher  practice by training NTC mentors, including participation in the program by AP and Principal to ensure high quality  instruction by all teachers.    PS 536 has formed strong partnerships with teacher training programs, such as Teachers College and the DOE  program Bilingual Pupil Services. We invite multiple student teachers and paraprofessionals from both programs  every year. We treat them as co-teachers in the classroom and work with them on trainings, professional  development, family engagement, and working with the larger school community. We then have a committee of  current staff, students, and family members work together to create an interview process that includes open houses  (to make sure demonstration lessons, group interviews, as well as individual conversations.    To retain our Highly Qualified Teachers, we support them as professionals by creating a collaborative, trusting  relationship. We value their input and empower them to become leaders in the building.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     PS 536 has an active MOSL committee. We selected the MOSLs for each teacher in collaboration with the grade teams  as well as individual teachers.   Grade teams meet twice a week to look at student work, create assessments, look at data, and adjust instruction.  Vertical Teams meet across grade, by content area twice a month to discuss student work samples as well as  assessments used. Adjustments are made based on these staff collaborations built in trust and understanding our our  school goals and our school community.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42     identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 536, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the ESSA, is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 536 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Paste response to questions here: In addition to the NYSITELL (Initial ELL entitlement assessment), Spanish LAB, ELL Periodic  Interim Assessment, and the NYSESLAT, students are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell in the lower grades (K-2) and  Renaissance for the upper grades (3-5) to determine their instructional levels within the classroom.  In the TBE class (Spanish),  students are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell in Spanish.  These reading assessment tools assess the students’ accuracy and  self-correction, comprehension and fluency skills.  The child’s ability is measured in comprehension and answering literal and  inferential questions after they are read a story.  The child may respond to questions in numerous ways, but its acceptable  only as long as the response for that question demonstrates the child’s understanding.  The running records of oral reading has  a set of conventions for coding reading errors: substitution, self-correction, repetition, omission, insertion, sounding out,  spelling words, and appeal for words.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      The bilingual /ENL teacher plan instruction according to the scores and develop vocabulary, phonemic awareness and reading  readiness to help the students. PS 536 uses the SIOP method when planning for instruction addressing the needs of the  students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Paste response to question here: The success of the TBE/ESL program for ELLs is based on the results of making gains (.43)  within the language levels of proficiency and the EDAT report.  Success in the NYSESLAT is measured by the students moving  one proficiency level .  When ELLs have transitioned from having basic interpersonal communication skills to having acquired  cognitive academic language proficiency, then there's favorable outcome, and truly ELLs have made a mark.  Additional  evidences of success for ELLs may also be measured by performance based tasks, such as: accurate paraphrase of what is  heard or read; following directions that involve multiple steps; using concept maps, semantic webs, or outlines to organized  information; producing a summary of information found in biography, text books; using facts and data from articles; writing  essays for content areas; and using technical terms correctly.     PS 536 also uses the ELL Periodic Assessments  and  NYC Performance Tasks   to identify progress and needs.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers, administrators and ENL teachers periodically log onto SCHOOLNET and use the data to address the needs of the  students.  The EDAT spreadsheet is a resource that teacher use to plan according to the needs      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Paste response to question here: P.S. 536 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention  framework by providing students with targeted instruction designed to meet their learning and language needs by using scores  of the performance on the Periodic and Benchmark assessments.  Within our school, educators come together to create high- quality instructional environments for the linguistically diverse populations, most specifically for those student who are flagged  as “at risk” or “below the benchmark”.  On any particular skill or competency, the student receives development in this area.  Administrators communicate the data and provide educators with the tools they need to collaborate.  They provide built-in  time for teachers to analyze data, problem solve and plan horizontally across the grades. to share data and  address the needs  of our students.  Classroom, AIS, and  Special Education teachers use data to differentiate instruction for ELLs in their  classroom.  They maximize student potential by sharing insights into student’s home life, family background and  interest.   Writing skills are addressed by providing the student with different types of writing tools, dialogue, journals, and  providing lessons within word work in context. (phonemic awareness, phonics, and sight words)  Modeling language structures  and the writing process is largely used.  Instructional support and intervention provide the ELL student with early intervention  through a tiered system.      PS 536 uses the RTI Framework to guide instruction by first asking if the student had any former interrupted education.  We  look at data such as HLIS, proficiency level , academic achievement(report card), and behavior.    While the student is in the  classroom , PS 536 uses quick, deliberate, and proactive means for addressing students who are in potential  academic failure  .  RTI aims at the prevention and early intervention through the tiered system of instructional support that may increase  during the duration of the day.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Paste response to question here:  According to the data patterns across proficiency levels in the NYSESLAT 2018, ELL’s are  scoring higher on the listening and speaking portion of the exam, as last year.  We had 10 students from grades 2-5 at the  reaching the Commanding level of language proficiency on the 2018 NYSESLAT.   ELLs continue to have demonstrated gains in  reading and writing scores, they continue to struggle in these areas.  It was also found that students entering in the NYC school  system are entering the system with prior knowledge of the English language according to the NYSITELL 2018, orally or in  written form.  Our incoming ELLs (K) attended a pre-K program prior to entering Kindergarten.  However, the students that  took the LAB Spanish demonstrated fluency in their language orally, but limited in written form.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         As a whole, 106 ELLs serviced in the 2017-2018 school year showed progress either in the listening and speaking and reading  and writing portions of the NYSESLAT 2018, with the exception of 5 students who showed no gains.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   NYSESLAT, ELA and MATH scores are shared amongst our teachers to plan and group our students.   PS 536 also uses the data  from EDAT to program their students according to their proficiency levels and academic needs in the four modalities.  We  make refence to the suggestions this program offers.   Students are programmed on STARS , making periodic updates  referred by the EDUR (monthly ELL Data Update Report) to ensure that all ELLs are programmed and tested accordingly.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Paste response to questions here: The ELL programs in place at P.S. 536x is composed of one TBE Spanish class in  kindergarten and 5 ENL stand-alone block classes in grades 1-5.  We also have a Freestanding ENL program servicing  students from grades K-5.  All classes are heterogeneously grouped across the grades.  Students in a special education  setting are serviced through the integrated Free Standing ENL program.   The teachers are either certified as a  bilingual teacher or currently enrolled in a TESOL program for appropriate certification.  Students at the  Entering/Emerging level of language proficiency receive the mandated 360 minutes per week and  Transitioning/Emerging students receive 180 minutes and Commanding receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction, as per  the mandate.  Students in the TBE program also receive one period per day of Native Language Arts, and two contents  in Spanish (Math and Science), as per Commissioner’s Regulations CR Part 154 mandates.        b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                In our self-contained TBE and ENL model, all students at the Entering and Emerging levels of language proficiency,  receive two units of ESL (360 minutes) and five periods of ELA instruction per week.  Students in the Transistioning  and  Expanding levels receive one unit (180 minutes) and five periods of ELA instruction per week,  and Commanding students  receive 90 minutes, as per regulation CR Part 154 and NYSEDs required Units of Instruction.  The students in the Transitional  Bilingual class also receive the mandated units of ENL according to their proficiency levels and one period per day of NLA  instruction in Spanish and two content areas in Spanish.  Students are entered using the STARS program, monitoring their  required mandates of minutes  and EDUR is used to make periodic updates on any incoming student.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Paste response here: Content areas are delivered in Spanish and English within each TBE classroom.  Enrichment teachers  use ESL methodologies throughout the day in their classrooms.  Teachers are also trained in SIOP, which is used when planning  lessons for both the TBE and ENL programs.  The programs at P.S. 536x increases the students’ English and native language in a  non-threatening environment through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities.   Some instructional strategies that  the ENL / TBE teacher employ in their classrooms are SIOP, Language Experience Approach, CALLA, Scaffold, Modeling – by  giving Step by Step instructions, Picture books, Dictionaries, Peer Tutoring/Buddy, Cooperative Learning and  Instruction  techniques along with Higher Order Thinking Skills (H.O.T.S.) which are incorporated across the content areas in both language  (English and Spanish) models to make it accessible and comprehensible for all students, applying Rigor for the ELLs.  The  writer’s workshop is implemented in the classroom and a Literacy Block of time is used to deliver instruction via the Readers  and Writers Workshop model.  P.S. 536x is using Lucy Caukins Units of Study to foster language development and Go Math  which are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  Each classroom has materials in their classroom such as: libraries  in Spanish and English , diverse centers, bilingual dictionaries, bilingual glossaries downloaded from the DOE website for Math  and Science.  As for test prep materials, P.S. 536x uses NYSESLAT test prep,  aligned to the CCLS.  Fountas and Pinnell in both  English and Spanish is usded for assessments.  As mentioned before, the TBE program delivers content based instruction in  Spanish (Math and Science ), each week.  In the ENL program, content area instruction is delivered in English providing support  using dictionaries, technology, glossaries and translation when needed.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Paste response to question here: At P.S. 536x, we ensure that all students are evaluated in their native language by using the  Spanish LAB when entering the public school system for the first time.  Students who are enrolled in a testing grade (3  rd  , 4   th   and 5th), the NYS Mathematics and Science are ordered in their native language, if available.  The school is also prepared  to hire translators, if needed for  State math and science testing.   Students in testing grades are given glossaries and use  dictionary in their native language, if available and used them when they are being assessed within the school year ,during all  academic areas.  Additionally, all students are assessed using Fountas and Pinell in English and Spanish during the Fall and  Spring.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Paste response to questions here: The TBE / ENL programs focuses on small group instruction using reading and language  proficiency levels in all content areas.  Students identified as SIFE,  newcomers, Developing, LTE, and former ELLs are offered  placement in programs such as the Newcomer Academy,  ELL morning school program,  AIS, and any test prep programs  available.  Students identified with special needs are offered the same programs with additional services as identified in their  Individual Education Plan (IEP).  There are no students presently identified as SIFE at P.S. 536x.  If we do get a student  identified as such, the same programs will be offered to them.  Classroom paraprofessionals are placed in classes when  indicated, to facilitate small group instruction and language support to our students.  P.S. 536x currently has 2 teacher interns  from BPS (Bilingual Pupil Services from Lehman College/City College), which assist in facilitating small group instruction within  the TBE classroom.  Small group instruction is used in every classroom across content areas.  Instruction is delivered  systematically and structured to develop cognitive skills, achieve comprehensive learning and maximize students’ English and  Native Language acquisition.  ESL strategies are used for all ELL students, as previously mentioned.  Former ELLs who exited  from ELL status will receive ENL for 90 minutes per week for two years, as well as testing accomodation.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Paste response to question here: Instructional programs and grade level materials teachers use to provide academic content  areas to ELLs and SWD  are Universal Design for Learning (UDL), SMART Boards for interactive instruction, Brain Pop, RTI –  strong Tier 1 high quality instruction, Small grouping, Modifying and Modeling,  grade leveled text, Sheltered Instruction  (SIOP), Total Physical Response, the use of graphic organizers, vocabulary development using the Frayer model, Audio-visual  aids, if needed, interactive centers and the continual review of student data during teacher team meetings.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Paste response to question here: P.S. 536x uses curricular, instructional and scheduling to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWD  by providing small group instruction, differentiating and using ESL strategies to enhance students’ learning.  We use the push- in/pull-out model to service the ELLs during SETSS and ENL services.  We bridge classes to meet the need of SWD (K/1, 3/4),  and send students during reading and math period blocks to form homogeneous groups, peer grouping according to  proficiency levels.   We also schedule students to attend classes in general education as recommended by their IEP.   Special  Ed, monolingual, ENL, and bilingual teachers collaborate with special providers to address the needs of the ELL-SWDs during  grade level meetings and Instructional Support Team meetings.    All students with disabilities receive the mandated ENL  minutes of instruction, as per CR-Part 154.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Paste response to question here: The following intervention programs for ELA, Math, Social Studies, Science and NLA are  offered to ELL students at P.S. 536x:  Morning school program and Newcommer Academy is also offered to all students,  including ELL-SWD.   All students in grades K-5 also participate in clubs and PBIS assembly each Friday afternoon.   ELLs  identified as "at risk" at P.S. 536x also receive intervention on individual and /or small group instruction in order to meet their  needs in the Special Education Support Service (SETTS)or Academic Intervention Services.  This support service is delivered by a  certified special education teacher to provide compensatory skills development and remediation activities to the identified  ELLs in the general ed or bilingual program.  This teacher also addresses the areas of deficit that have been identified by the  students IEP or relevant data  to strengthen his/her academic disability.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Paste response to question here: For the upcoming school year, P.S. 536x plans to incorporate more technological tools  including a movable computer lab cart and the use of SMARTboards in all classrooms.  Interactive programs, such as Safari  Montage, Brainfuse, SMARTboard Exchange, and Brain Pop will be used throughout the school building (K-5 ) for the students  identified as ELLs in the TBE and ENL programs.  We will also be using the REACH program which is aligned to the Common  Core for ESL instruction and  Cancionero for Native Language Arts instruction for Kindergarten in the TBE Spanish program.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Paste response to question here:  Due to the increasing ELL population at P.S. 536x, we forsee NO programs or services being  discontinued.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Paste response to question here: At P.S. 536x, ELLs are afforded equal access to ALL school programs, curricular and extra- curricular activities.  Students identified as English Language Learners participate in programs offered to students at their  grade level, including after-school programs, special assemblies, trips and any other activity offered.  These programs are  offered to ALL students (SWD, ELLs, Monolingual - K-5).  Supplemental materials for the programs include, but not limited to:  Brain Pop, Cornerstone Newcomer and Spotlight.  Letters are sent home to parents informing them of these activities and to  encourage their child to participate.  Letters are translated in the students’ native language, when possible.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Paste response to question here: Instructional materials used at P.S. 536x are computers, SMARTboards, textbooks,  workbooks, dictionaries in the students’ native language, thesaurus, novels (when possible in the native language).  Also  included in the ENL/TBE classrooms are libraries in Spanish, in different genres that portray a wide variety of cultural  experience and ethnic backgrounds.  They are mostly used for Read Aloud and independent reading.  These are especially  helpful in supporting student’s native language and support instruction and allow for differentiated learning.  They are also  available on loan for students to take home.  We also provide Brain Pop a technology program to all ELLs .   The school also  provides the students with a movable technology cart with ipads in them throughout the school day.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Paste response to question here:  Students’ Home Language support is delivered in the self-contained TBE and ENL programs  with the use of dictionaries in the native language, novels and when possible, oral translation by either a “buddy” student or  the teacher.   TBE program is currently using Cancionero,  which is a comprehensible program to support Native Language  instruction.  Fountas and Pinell assessment is used in Spanish, for those in need.  We are also currently updating our Common  core library in Spanish.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    PS 536 screens new ELL students and ensures they are receiving appropriate services based on language needs, such as small  group instruction, phonics and phonemic awareness, native language supports, etc.      15.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At P.S. 536, the following steps were used to assess the preferred languages of the parents for both oral and  written forms. During the initial registration period, documents are given to the parents in their preferred  language, if available. Both the Student Identification Emergency Card and the last two questions of the Home  Language Survey asks the parent their preferred language before signing the form. This information is transferred  onto the initial ATS during registration. Also, during the beginning of the school year a survey is sent home by  backpack to the parents regarding workshops being provided requesting their preferred language so that  interpretation could be arranged for any upcoming meetings. An RAPL , UPPG, RPOB ,and RCPL reports from ATS  could also be generated indicating the parents home language for the entire school. School staff members that  speaks Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali and Mandingo provide translation services, if needed. For all other  languages, translation can be completed via the DOE Translation Unit.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         2.
