The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Public School 78’s mission is to create a caring and supportive environment where both students, staff and parents  feel valued and supported. We will prioritize:    Children and Community First    A chievement and Student Outcomes    R espect and Trust    Equity and Excellence    Public School 78’s Vision    Public School 78 is committed to equity and excellence. Every child regardless of race, home life or circumstance will  be challenged to a high level of academic success. We will do this by providing our school community with the tools  and resources to ensure everyone moves toward a shared belief in equity, excellence and high expectations for all  learners.    Public School 78’s Instructional Focus    IF School Leaders and Impact Teams work together in inquiry cycles to identify the gaps between the standards and  student performance and use data to plan for equitable outcomes, THEN instruction will be customized to meet the  social-emotional and academic needs of ALL learners and stakeholders will be committed to promoting high levels of  academic success to ensure all students become independent lifelong learners.    At Public School 78, we believe all students can learn and will reach their highest potential with the appropriate  supports. We believe that we cannot do this job without the support and involvement of our parents. We conduct  Academic Parent Teacher Teams which allows our parents to forge relationships with other parents, and participate in  hands on activities to help reinforce skills at home.    We place a high level of importance on collaboration and support for our teachers. Our teachers work collaboratively  to develop unit and lesson plans and resources as well as to share best practices. We have common planning built into  the daily schedule which allows us to ensure a high level of consistency and cohesiveness in the content and  pedagogy across classrooms. All students are held to a high standard and have access to a rigorous curriculum.  Teachers unpack the standards to develop learning intentions and success criteria. The teachers plan differentiated  lessons to ensure that students are being supported and challenged. School leaders ensure that teachers meet  students where they are and customize learning to motivate instruction by providing specific and actionable feedback  after observations, ongoing professional development that takes place internally and externally. The curriculum we  use is rigorous and aligned with the Common Core State Standards.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 78 is located in Stapleton. We serve approximately 800 students in our current pre-k to grade five. We  have approximately 250 students with IEPs and 75 students designated as English Language Learners. Our Title I  eligible percentage is 95%. Our staff and families work closely to make sure all of our students are performing at their  highest potential and that their basic needs are being met. We work closely with community based organizations to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      make sure families are receiving the support they need to put education at the forefront. Our community is extremely  transient and our stability rate from Kindergarten to fifth grade is 20%.    Public School 78 was founded in 2012, and we have worked tirelessly to involve our families and the community to  improve student outcomes. In 2013-14 we received the designation of Community Learning School by the  Department of Education and have worked closely with our families and community to conduct a community needs  assessment and identify potential resources to address those needs. We hold several community forums to identify  areas with formalized breakout sessions. The community meetings have been evolving since the schools inception and  have worked to build a culture of trust between the school and the larger community. Our families have confidence in  the work we are doing and our students receive supports through a range of social and emotional partners within the  community school structure. We have established a relationship with over 18 community based organizations to  support students and families. Some of our strategic partnerships are with North Shore Alliance, LINC, Teacher's  College Reading and Writing Project, National Teaching Network, College of Staten Island Master Teaching Fellows,  Strategies for Success, Teacher Leadership Program (TLP), Orton Gillingham, Reading Rescue, NY Cypher Arts,  Professional Learning Collaborative, UFT, SUNDOG, YMCA, NY PHILHARMONIC, New York Road Runner, New Life  Literacy, Dancing in the Classrooms, Salvation Army and additional residencies to support the arts.   For the 2018-19 school year, our school will continue as a full member of the Teacher's College Project community.  We will maintain a close partnership and have a shared vision on instructional practices. As a Teacher's College  Project school, we will have two lab sites as well as a k-2 and 3-5 staff developer. Our teachers will attend a total of 30  calendar days on various topics and then turnkey the information to the school community. All teachers will be  implementing the workshop model which allows for scaffolding, a gradual release of responsibility and differentiation.   Our Professional Learning time on Monday will be differentiated based upon the needs of the staff and will be led by  teacher leaders, as well as school leaders. One particular structure that we will put in place during Professional  Learning is ensuring time for both vertical, as well as horizontal team collaboration and inquiry work. This ensures key  learning and best practices are shared among all teachers/grades.    We have recently been identified by New York State as a Focus School. To address our focus school designation, we  will continue to implement the initiatives from the prior school year such as, Orton Gillingham, Core Collaborative and  Teacher's College Units of Study. All k-2 special education teachers (a total of 9 teachers) have been trained in Orton  Gillingham to assist students in developing their phonemic awareness and phonics skills. For the 2018-19 school year,  we will be training an additional 14 teachers in attempt to get the upper grade special education teachers and the  general education teachers in kindergarten.    Title III funds will be used to purchase Imagine Learning, an online platform and research-based, standards-aligned  curriculum that builds core reading and academic language skills, including first-language support in 15 languages. In  addition, our ENL students are offered additional phonics support after school. Strategic placement of students to  enable push-in services. Collaboration and articulation between the ENL and classroom teacher will include English as  a New Language methodologies to improve student achievement. Our ENL population will be supported by licensed  teachers within the classrooms.    In addition, we have established a guiding coalition team and will partner with PS 9 to deepen our work using the nine  protocols set forth by the Core Collaborative to support our impact teams. We will unpack the standards, refine unit  maps, and incorporate rubrics, checklists and access to tools and other resources to support all learners. Through  meaningful teacher feedback students will be made aware of their next steps and take ownership of their learning.  We will conduct evidence walks throughout the year to observe best practice, provide timely feedback and identify  gaps in student learning or teacher pedagogy. We anticipate that with the additional programs and extended use of  rubrics, checklists and meaningful feedback, we will improve our student outcomes in English Language Arts and  Mathematics.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      P.S. 78 has joined the Computer Science for All (CS4All) Staten Island Cohort 01 for the 2018-2019 school year.  Participation provides us with direct support from the CS4All team, including on-site visits with our CS Education  Manager and designated partners, as well as 30 hours of training for two teachers as we work to design units of  computer science integrated with existing subjects, one per grade band: K-2 and 3-5. The CS4All initiative’s  expectation is that schools provide one unit of CS to every student at each grade band by 2025. Currently, over 50% of  classes in the building receive direct computer science instruction centered around block and text-based  programming. Mrs. Lugo and Mrs. Heidel are using the code.org platform to guide our inaugural year of CS instruction  as we work toward meeting the following (working) vision: Our vision is that through an integrated computer science  experience, our students will develop the resilience and persistence necessary to achieve their goals in the face of  21st century challenges, and that our students are recognized as leaders in technology and computer science  programs in middle school and beyond.   We are in our third and final year with the Dissemination grant. Teachers have received training in 22 components of  Danielson and have participated in peer to peer feedback. We have had inter-visitations with Lavelle Prepatory to  share best practices and provide feedback aligned with the Danielson Framework. Our teachers engage in the self- assessment process post observation and are currently developing a plan to make this work sustainable.   We are departmentalized in grade 5 and have sent three teachers to participate in Algebra for All. In addition, we  have scheduled 20 days of in classroom coaching, on site professional development and data analysis in math with the  National Teaching Network. The goal is to increase mathematical discourse, academic language and increase student's  conceptual understanding. We will be focusing on Standards of Mathematical Practice 1, 3 and 6.   Though we are a large a school, we place high value and are committed to establishing strong-family and community  ties. As a Community Learning School, we offer parent workshops on bullying, taking care of the caregiver, and  additional topics throughout the year. We receive several donations from partnerships throughout the year to  support our students and families. We offer ESL classes twice a week and would like to add GED and technology this  year.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018 NYS Data Points      The number of students achieving Level 1 on the NYS ELA Exam, went from 193 students in 2017 to 176   students in 2018, which is a decrease of 2.29%.      The number of African American Students achieving Level 1 on the NYS ELA Exam went from 93 students in   2017 to 74 students in 2018 which is a decrease of 11.5%. Our level 2 students went from 40 students  achieving Level 2 in 2017, to 61 students achieving Level 2 in 2018. This is an increase of 13% but this also  means our Level 1 students were able to achieve a Level 2 in 2018.   In Mathematics, our SWDs achieving a Level 2 decreased by 8.5%, and approximately 4.5% moved from a  Level 2 in 2017 to a Level 3 in 2018.         Our ENL students achieving a Level 1 in 2017 decreased by 7.6% in 2018.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress was in Effective  School Leadership. As a result of effective school leadership, our administrative cabinet conducts evidence walks with  and without teachers based on a problem of practice. Through teacher self-assessment, walk-through, inter- visitations, instructional rounds, advance data and impact teams scheduled throughout the year, we plan future  professional development, inquiry cycles and next steps. As an administrative cabinet, we calibrate once during each       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      cycle, ensured each teacher received timely feedback via a feedback conference as well as an opportunity to self- assess using the Danielson rubric. Before feedback conferences teachers will use a yellow highlighter to self-assess  where they feel their practice falls on the Danielson rubric for the lesson that was observed. We would like to expand  this work and continue to focus on this element of the Framework by having teachers provide their peers feedback  after an inter-visitation, lesson study or peer observation cycle. We are in our third year with the Dissemination Grant  which has allowed us to train a select teachers on all 22 components of the Danielson rubric. Each participant then  trained a colleague and participated in the peer observation cycle. For the 2018-19 school year, an additional four  teachers will be receiving training in the 22 components of Danielson and they will use their knowledge to conduct  inter-visitations to improve their practice and mutually agree upon next steps based on the Danielson Framework. For  the 2018-19 school year, teachers will participate in professional development, both internal and external, based on  their instructional needs. Danielson data reports will be generated and professional development will be planned to  address specifics skills and strategies in each domain. Enhancing Professional Practice will be used as an action tool  and resource to improve teacher pedagogy. Through our partnerships with Teacher's College Reading and Writing  Project, National Teaching Network and Orton Gillingham, our teachers receive on site staff development, coaching  and modeling as well as opportunities to co-teach and plan.                    2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R078   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   845   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   104  100   15     % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   57  36   18     # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   96.0%  % Attendance Rate  94.1%  % Reduced Lunch  8.3%   % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   1.8%  47.2%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  3.8%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience   0.08  0%  18%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   16.3%  Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   56%   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   N/A  N/A  N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

Strengths from Quality Review 2016-17   According to our 2016-17 Quality review, the majority of teachers participate in structured, inquiry-based grade-level  teams where trained leaders facilitate and maintain structures to engage in these professional collaborations. Teachers  participate in decision-making (4.2) School leaders consistently communicate their expectations for assessment and  student engagement. School staff communicate and offer feedback to parents towards meeting grade-level  expectations. (3.4)    Areas for Improvement Quality Review 2016-17   According to our 2016-17 Quality review, teaching strategies have yet to consistently provide multiple entry points into  the curricula or scaffolding to support students’ thinking in work products and discussions. Curricula, learning objectives,  and academic tasks have yet to consistently reflect rigorous habits and the use of data for refinements, including  modifications across grades and subject areas. The analysis of common assessments and the use of rubrics with clear       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           19      alignment to success criteria, the school curricula, and national standards have yet to be consistently utilized effectively  across grades and subject areas. (1.1, 1.2 and 2.2)   According to our 2017 PPO, we had an improved observation completion rate of 91.03 completion rate by May 15,  2017. An area of celebration was the use of Advance reports to inform professional development. It was noted that  administration and teachers are working closely to examine the standards and develop unit outlines. It was  recommended that we continue to provide teachers with actionable and time-stamped feedback that will improve  teacher pedagogy. Teachers meet with administration to design curriculum, make strategic changes to our instructional  program. An area of focus is to have teachers consistently implement checks for understanding, provide actionable  feedback on student work and develop multiple entry points so all students can access the curriculum and meet the  standards.   Areas of growth noted in PPO Spring 2018   After an in depth of visit of classrooms, teacher teams, and reading rescue, it was determined that all stakeholders were  accountable for student outcomes and there was distributed leadership throughout. We observed a vertical teacher  team using the Evidence-Analysis-Protocol and have built capacity in this area. In the classroom visits, students were  engaged, on task and had tools and checklists available. Additionally, we have maximized our resources to purchase  staff development and have applied for grants as well.   2017-18 School Quality Guide   According to the 2017-18 school quality snapshot, we are approaching our target for rigorous instruction. However. 90%  of teachers say they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and writing experiences grounded in  evidence form the text, both literary and informational.   Strengths:   -Professional Collaborative teams: ELA, Math, Data, Behavior Intervention, Lighthouse, Attendance, Instructional Lead,  Grade Level Teams, Response to Intervention. In the beginning of the year, each team sets norms and goals.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   We have Staten Island Mental Health (counselor on site) and Partnership With Children ( a director, social worker,  interns and a case manager) to support our students and families mental health. The social workers assist the families in  getting access to support and resources.  In addition, we have two guidance counselors who provide mandated and at  risk counseling. The school has developed an internal Behavior Intervention Team. The team has a diverse composition  and includes school based staff (administration, teachers, guidance counselors, psychologist and social worker) as well  as the social workers from our community based organizations, SIMH and PWC. There is a clear referral process  available to all teachers and teachers can refer students to the team. The team will then discuss the student at length  and develop strategies to improve classroom behavior. The team may also refer the child to SIMH or PWCs caseload for  individual counseling, group counseling or parent case management. A member of the team will be assigned to manage  the student case and assess progress. A form was created to give to the classroom teachers intermittently to assess how  the strategies are working.    In collaboration with the Professional Learning Collaborative, we have trained the teachers of grades 2, 3 and 4 in  community circles.

Circles conversations are regulated by the use of a "talking piece." In a Circle, the Keeper presents a  prompt, question, or topic to the group, and a talking piece is passed sequentially around the Circle. Each person is  invited to speak when the talking piece reaches them. Circles ensure that all voices are heard, and that each member of  a class feels like a valuable part of the community. A Circle takes about fifteen minutes from start to finish.   This year our school had a Lighthouse Team that met weekly to integrate the 7 Habits of Happy Kids into our school  curriculum. The team developed monthly school-wide PBIS challenges and students were recognized for exhibiting one  of the seven habits. Through a staff survey and additional PBIS training, the team realized that next year they need to  establish school-wide behavioral expectations linked to the 7 Habits of Happy Kids and the teachers need to explicitly  teach those positive behaviors in beginning of year and students should be recognized for exhibiting the school-wide  positive behavioral expectations.    Our 7 Habits of Happy Kids clip chart has 7 sections which focus on the 7 Habits of Happy Kids. Tier 1 interventions  include but are not limited to, rewards, prizes, praise expected behavior, breaks, and redirection. Tier 2 interventions  include but are not limited to, counseling referral, daily behavior plan, and parent outreach. Tier 3 interventions include  behavior contracts, counseling with a mental health provider, visual schedules and a referral to RTI, BIT team, and  possible FBA or BIP. At our BIT team meetings, we triage approximately 80-100 students.       We have a high referral rate and as a result, in our School Implementation Team action plan our goal is to reduce the  initial referral rate from 10% to 8% for the 2018-19 school year. Our Behavior Intervention Team, TCIS, PBIS systems  help to improve student behavior so that student removals will decrease, intensity and frequency of misbehaviors will  decrease, and students will have more opportunities to be successful academically. Analysis of challenging student  behavior indicates that the function of the behavior is often task avoidance or display of frustration due to academic  demands. Providing academic support decreases negative behaviors in the classroom and allows students to access  curriculum. RTI referral forms indicate that some students are struggling academically also struggle to manage their  behavior. BIT referral forms, OORS reports, and anecdotal quantitative data continue to allow us to understand behavior  and plan next steps. About 80% % of the school staff has been trained in TCIS. Common school language and de- escalation strategies help at-risk students learn constructive ways to handle crisis.    2017-18 School Quality Guide   According to the 2018-19 school quality snapshot, we are not meeting our target in the area of supportive environment  and commitment under collaborative teachers. However, we have met the target for the social and emotional learning  target.   Strengths:   -Our RTI providers enter data into RTI spreadsheet. Progress monitoring mid-cycle and end-of-cycle shared with  classroom teachers and parents. Reading Rescue ongoing data collection is reviewed bi-monthly by the Reading Rescue  Coordinator. OG informal ongoing assessments are used for grouping students and advancement to next steps. TC  reading levels are assessed 5 times a year.   -The RTI teams meets weekly to discuss student referrals, analyze data, create assessments aligned to standards, and  group students based on need. The BIT meets weekly to discuss student referrals, analyze data, and create supports for  students. The Attendance team meets weekly to discuss at risk students and create incentives for parents and students  to improve attendance.

Classrooms, teachers, and  support staff utilize consistent methods to reward students. The Lighthouse Team works to educate staff and students  how to live by the 7 Habits.    -School guidance counselors conduct specialized groups for anger management (recognizing triggers and learning coping  skills) and self-esteem (personal hygiene, dealing with bullying, and improving self-worth).    -We established a Lighthouse team comprised of staff from different constituents to encourage leadership and promote  change among the students and staff.    -On May 18, 2018, we held our third Leadership Day to highlight students and provide students with the opportunity to  explain how the 7 habits, Leader in Me has influenced their lives. Additionally, the students and staff voted on the new  school mascot which was revealed during the school wide assembly.    -Currently, we have one Staten Island Mental Health counselor on site to assist students and families with their social  and emotional well-beings   -We have Partnership with Children, social services to support students and families in crisis. PWC conduct home visits  and conduct family reach regarding various issues such as, attendance, lateness, educational neglect, etc. PWC staff  includes a Social Worker Director, Early Intervention Social Worker and a case manager.   -We have two guidance counselors to fulfill counseling mandates and to see students who are at risk.   -Increased parent involvement and engagement through various school events by communicating with parents via  notices and electronically through the school's website.    -Keep parents updated using a school wide applications such as Pupil Path and School Messenger   Priority Needs:   -More streamlined attendance measures and structures    -Continue to work with CBOs to support families and students in the social and emotional learning.   -Complete TCIS training for all staff   -Provide boosters for TCIS trained staff   -Analyze data from OORS forms         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment.

Our school wide program supports the structure of teacher teams. Each team sets norms, creates agenda and minutes  for each meeting. We are in our fifth cohort of the Teacher Leadership Program where teachers learn how to lead  teacher teams that share culturally responsive pedagogical practices that promote equity in order to better serve all  students, especially students that have been historically under served and marginalized. Our team facilitators use  protocols to look at student data and explore articles. Within these teams they create the learning space to share best  practices that allow students to become independent lifelong learners. During staff and grade level meetings,  administration helps staff understand how our vision, mission and instructional focus aligns with the Chancellor's  priorities and district's vision, mission and instructional focus.    Strengths:   - There is already an existing structure in place for teams to meet. Facilitators have been selected and protocols have  been established.    - All of our school teams are facilitated by teacher leaders that have either completed the Teacher Leadership Program  or are currently enrolled in the Teacher Leadership Program.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           32      - Units have been developed by teachers and are aligned to the common core learning standards and sequence of  engage NY.    -According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot, 97% of teachers say that teachers at this school work together to  design instruction.    -According to the 2017-18 School Quality Snapshot, 80% of teachers have responded positively regarding collaborative  teachers.   -Protocols and practices build community and collaboration and allow for equity of voice.   -Teacher collaboration on best practices and sharing of resources allow for student ownership and independence.

One of the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress was in Effective  School Leadership. As a result of effective school leadership, our administrative cabinet conducts evidence walks with  and without teachers based on a problem of practice. Through teacher self-assessment, walk-throughs, inter-visitations,  instructional rounds, advance data and impact teams scheduled throughout the year, we plan future professional  development, inquiry cycles and next steps. As an administrative cabinet, we calibrate once during each cycle, ensured  each teacher received timely feedback via a feedback conference as well as an opportunity to self-assess using the  Danielson rubric. Before feedback conferences teachers will use a yellow highlighter to self-assess where they feel their  practice falls on the Danielson rubric for the lesson that was observed. We would like to expand this work and continue  to focus on this element of the Framework by having teachers provide their peers feedback after an inter-visitation,  lesson study or peer observation cycle.    The percent of students reading at Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading Level I at the end of first grade has grown from  45% to 88% in one year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           37      The school went from having 58% of its students below the national average on the Kindergarten Fall Sight Word  benchmark assessment to having 92% of students of students at or above the national average on the Kindergarten  Spring Sight Word benchmark assessment.   The Fountas and Pinnell results for the last three years indicate:    The graduating cohort of 2015-16 has consistently decreased their performance at level 1.   ▪ The graduating cohort of 2016-2017 has also decreased the percentage of students performing at level 1.    ▪ The percentage of students reading at levels 3 and 4 combined for the 2013-14 SY (32.6%) to the 2014-15 SY (45.7%)  showed dramatic improvement.   ▪ There has been a consistent decrease in the number of students’ reading at level 1 since the 2013-14 SY.   According to our 2015-16 Principal's Performance Review, our area for improvement falls under Quality Review  indicator, 4.1 Teacher Feedback. We need to strengthen the feedback teachers receive on instructional strategies and  tie the feedback to our professional development plan.    Instructional Moves:   -The school leaders made the decision to establish a partnership with TCRWP in order to provide the highest quality of  instruction for all of our students and to improve the reading levels of all of our students. We know this decision was  correct because of the following improvements in our informal and formal observations of ICT classes. The student  behavior increased and the level of engagement increased.    -School leaders made the decision to add AIS personnel and an ELA and math coach to support student pedagogy. The  coaches will support the curriculum mapping, provide demonstration lessons and pull small groups of students who  have been identified as at risk.    -School leaders made the decision to create an Academic Intervention Service Teacher for Kindergarten to focus on  phonological awareness, classroom management and academic services since several of our kindergarten students do  not receive early intervention services or attend pre-K.   -The school leaders have added AIS positions utilizing Tax Levy and Title I funding from the budget. In addition, we  applied for the Reading Rescue grant to provide at risk services in first grade. For the 2016-17 school year, we will be  training additional tutors so we can service more students.    -We have sent a team of teachers to attend Heidi Hayes Jacob curriculum mapping boot camp and plan on integrating  science and social studies in literacy lessons.    -We opted in to the Amplify Science program and Passport Program for Social Studies..   -We contracted on-site professional development and coaching with Ms. O'Neil in Orton Gillingham. All special  education teachers will have training by June 2019.   -We contracted NTN for 20 days of support to increase mathematical discourse, academic language and conceptual  understanding.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           38      -Teachers use entry and exit tickets before and after lessons to assess student understanding. During lessons, students  engage in self- assessments to rate their understandings and rubrics to evaluate their work. Teachers have ongoing  conferences with students and provide actionable feedback at those conferences.    School Strengths:   -Leadership has systems in place for sharing a clear vision for student achievement.   -Community circles are consistently being implemented in grades 2 , 3, and 4.   -Principal has set the tone and has created a climate of inclusiveness among the staff and students.   -Professional development is offered to teachers both, internally and externally based on teacher needs and interest.   -School leaders meet with the school community consistently to determine needs and to elicit feedback.   -Cohesive and reflective administrative cabinet.   -Teacher team structures and distributed leadership   Priority Needs:   -Increase in student engagement and teacher understanding of engagement vs. compliance   -More coherent instructional and social and emotional support that improves student outcomes and improves self- regulation and managing their own behavior.   -Additional training and professional development for staff in progressive discipline, strategies to motivate students and  de-escalate student crisis.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  We have two full day universal Pre-k classes which provide high quality instruction. We offer parent workshops  towards the end of the school year to assist them in preparing their students for kindergarten. We distribute a packet  with information on how to get your students ready for kindergarten. In addition, we prepare a schedule and take the  pre- k students on trips to visit the kindergarten classes. Our pupil accounting secretary sends home notices informing  the parents of kindergarten registration. Our pre-k teachers are included in the professional development with our K- 2 teachers. We work with local UPK sites and set up classroom visits to help ease the transition to kindergarten. The  IEP teacher works closely with the school psychologist to coordinate students who are turning five and ensure they  are properly placed when they attend kindergarten.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     During our instructional team meetings, teachers review the assessment data and decide as a team which  assessments will be used to measure student learning. We use protocols to review student work and determine next  steps for student improvement.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds   must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant  application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Public School 78, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Public School 78 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Public School 78 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating  children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   P.S. 78’s instructional focus last year was on using data and having teachers work with teacher teams consistently to  analyze data and create daily formative assessment and revising lesson plans. Teachers focused on creating multiple  entry points for all students to increase their academic achievements. While working in teacher teams, teachers  established common set of beliefs on how students learn, and developed opportunities for student to student  discussions, self-assessments, accountable talk, and protocols. This year (2018-2019) we would like to deepen that  work and ensure that all staff members are provided with meaningful and actionable feedback to improve their  practice as well as all students will receive actionable feedback from their teachers that will extend their learning.        Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    For the 2018-19 school year, our school will continue our partnership with the Teacher's College Reading and Writing  Project. We will maintain a close partnership and have a shared vision on instructional practices. As a Teacher's  College Project school, we will have two lab sites as well as a k-2 and 3-5 staff developer. Our teachers will attend a  total of 30 calendar days on various topics and then turnkey the information to the school community. All teachers  will be implementing the workshop model which allows for scaffolding, a gradual release of responsibility and  differentiation.   Our Professional Learning time on Monday will be differentiated based upon the needs of the staff and will be led by  teacher leaders, as well as school leaders. One particular structure that we will put in place during Professional  Learning is ensuring time for both vertical, as well as horizontal team collaboration. This ensures key learning and best  practices are shared among all teachers/grades.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      By June 2019, 100% of our classroom teachers will complete five Teachers College Reading and Writing units of study  in grades k-5 in reading and writing as evidenced by the pre and post assessments supported by data informed  instructional shifts to support individual student achievement            Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?   Health & Wellness- Implement and support the roll out of the PBIS matrix to nurture and empower all  stakeholders to provide a safe and supportive learning environment. Staff will attend a four day training  at TCIS/ PLC. We currently have 40% of our staff trained. BIT (Behavior Intervention Team) will meet  once a week, identify high needs, priority one students and develop an action plan to meet social and  emotional needs. Furthermore, with the collaboration of Partnership with Children and Staten Island  Mental Health who provide all mental health, case management, and external referrals to different tiers  of students/families at P.S.78.         Family Engagement- We will conduct 4 community forums throughout the year to identify the needs of  the community. Additionally, we will host parent workshops on behavior, reading, bullying, caretaker,  homework and the Common Core Learning Standards. All notices will be translated in the parent's home  language. Teachers will maintain parent outreach logs and establish a trusting relationship so everyone  can help support the student at home and so families are seen as partners in their child's education.  Conduct monthly activities (Reading night, game night, dances, poetry night) to increase the parent  involvement.      Academic Parent-Teacher Teams (APTT) Meetings that will be conducted throughout the school year  replacing the traditional parent-teacher conferences. The premise of this work is to create a strong  foundation for the school-home relationships between our teachers and parents. Through these efforts  they will work together to set realistic goals for their children's academic progress through the sharing  of academic data and working on hands on activities. We will be training the whole second grade team  in APTT and select kindergarten teachers.      Attendance Supports- Weekly Attendance Meetings that we are calling "Here to Learn." These meeting  will be conducted every Tuesday morning to discuss Attendance Goals and Strategies. School wide  incentives and through the implementation of Student Success Mentoring Program that will promote  and celebrate attendance as an "Opportunity to Learn" will be reinforced throughout the year. Teachers  will display evidence of class attendance in the classrooms and conduct mini math lessons around  attendance goals. "Here to Learn" team members will also look at the Student Sorter data to identify  chronically absent students. We will also be targeting those chronically absent students in the Tier 2  pyramid (Students with Absences in the 83-89%) and moving them to the Tier 1 area. Our Attendance  Goal is 93% for this academic year. Teachers will target two students in their class that meet this criteria  and become mentors to these students as well as offer incentives to them and their families in order to  increase attendance. The premise is to build on those school home relationships and while also building       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      trust and offer these families real life supports for their children to succeed academically. Educating our  families and students on the importance of attendance and celebrating these positive outcomes that are  directing related to good academic standing and achievement is the message we would like all to  understand.

Our goal as Educators at  P.S. 78 is to support our English Language Learners to become lifelong readers, writers, and  speakers of English and other languages. The Title III supplemental programs will be a  wonderful learning opportunity for our English Language Learners to be successful in being  proficient in English. Our ELLs are in need of intensive support in English language  development. All of the supplementary programs will provide linguistic support, scaffold  techniques, and intense support in the English Language.       The Title III program would run for the duration of the school year. It would be provided  from 2:45 to 4:45 on Wednesdays. The teacher would be a TESOL certified teacher. It will  include the "Newcomers and SIFE" and "Entering and Emerging" Leveled English Language  Learners in Grades K, 1, and 2.  Our ELLs are struggling to reach proficiency in English  Language acquisition and academic grade level-expectations. The curriculum we will be using  on Wednesdays is called Orton Gillingham. Also, we will be using a computer based program  named Imagine Learning on Wednesdays and Saturdays.      The Orton Gillingham program would address the needs of ELLs to improve their phonics and  spelling. The Orton-Gillingham is language-based, multisensory, structured, and allows  differentiation for all of our ELLs needs in enhancing their English Language skills. It will  improve the need of our ELLs to enhance their literacy skills.  It will be taught in English by a  TESOL certified teacher. The teacher will proved direct instruction, with a focus on academic  vocabulary, and a goal of improving English Language Learners’ reading comprehension,  vocabulary, and writing skills.  The TESOL teacher would be trained in Orton Gillngham. The  teacher would incorporate and refer to the Next Generation Learning Standards to improve  English Language Learners’ listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills, and writing skills.  The TESOL teacher will collaborate with the classroom teacher. The TESOL teacher would  work closely with the classroom teachers and parents of ELLs to ensure that they best meet the  needs of the individual students, and collaboratively identify the best practices. The language of  instruction for all Title III programming is English, using the home language as a tool to support  student understanding, activate prior knowledge, and make connections to the content and  language demands as needed. This program will focus on language development, and improving  linguistic and phonetic awareness. The focus of this program will also shift to grammar and  conventions, after ELLs begin to show progress in basic linguistic skills.       The teacher would provide illustrated and bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, visual  manipulative tools, anchor charts, translated/bilingual materials, software and online program,  and illustrated leveled books, in addition to scaffold support and various differentiated student  materials. Also, the teacher will address the ELL students’ areas in need of improvement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   according to classroom data of TC Assessments, Imagine Learning Assessments, NYSTIELL,  and NYSESLAT according to the RLAT.        In addition, to using the Orton Gillingham program we will be using Imagine Learning. It is a  technology based program that will allow our ELLs to maintain their native language and learn  English as a second Language and learn Math. Imagine Learning would be used for after school  on Wednesdays and for Saturdays so our ELLs can be successful in gaining literacy and math  skills. Research has shown success among ELLs if given at least 90 minutes a week to learn  English and increase math fluency skills. Furthermore, our ELL families will be given the  opportunity to attend parent workshops about Imagine Learning so they may assist their children  at home.  Our ELLs will be taking a 3 benchmark tests in Literacy and in Math. Parents of ELLs  will be informed about the results and be given additional resources to support and work with  their child at home based on the results of area of academic need. In addition, ELL families will  be invited to see their children present what they have learned from these supplementary  programs.       Furthermore, the TESOL teacher will infuse technology during Wednesdays and Saturdays so  students can maintain their native language, but, yet add existing languages skills to their second  language and build their comprehension skills. The use of technology will provide all of our ELL  students with direct instruction in English and in math, in addition to reinforce those skills in  their native language to bridge gaps and activate prior knowledge.        The Saturday program will be offered at 8:20 am -12:20 pm. It will be offered to our 3rd, 4th,  and 5th graders with an emphasis for our "Newcomers/SIFE" and "Entering and Emerging"  ELLs.  The teacher will be a TESOL certified teacher. The TESOL teacher will give instruction  in English. The program will focus on test prep to enhance student’s test taking strategies as well  as for our ELLs to be prepared for N.Y.S. ELA and Math tests.  The teacher would provide  illustrated and bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and test prep guides and materials.  Furthermore, visual manipulative tools, anchor charts, and the Imagine Learning program would  be used. It will be used to enhance our English Language Learners’ literacy and math  skills.  Imagine Learning gives directions in the ELLs home language and in English. First, our  ELLs take a diagnostic test. Afterwards, Imagine Learning uses the results from the diagnostic  testing to help them improve in those areas.  As for Imagine Math facts, it teaches students math  facts though a series of powerful engaging activities on multiplication, division, addition and  subtractions helping each ELL student to quickly gain automaticity and math fluency. The  TESOL teacher will use data from Imagine Learning to provide ELLs with direct teaching  instruction in English, using small group instruction and one to one instruction.               Clearly, these two supplementary programs on Wednesdays and Saturdays with using the  Orton Gillingham program and Imagine Learning will support our English Language Learners to  be successful in meeting linguistic proficiency and to meet grade level expectations in reading,  writing, and in math.

In order for our ELLs to be  successful, the teachers must be fully equipped with a wealth of knowledge and resources as to  how to best meet the needs of each student, holistically.          The ENL teacher will conduct a two-hour beginning-of-year Professional Development  workshop to explain necessary ENL terminology and programming, in-class scaffolding,  differentiated instruction, language support, supplemental programs that enhance linguistic  development, and general resources to support ELLs and teachers of ELLs.  The staff will be  informed of instructional strategies and scaffold approaches to ELL instruction, in addition to the  ELL identification and placement process.  Also, the ENL teacher will  provide teachers of  ELLs with a portfolio of tools, materials, and resources needed to fully support their  ELLs academically, socially, and emotionally, which will be added to throughout the year, and  referred to during middle-of-year and end-of-year Professional Development session, facilitated  by the ENL teacher.          The two-hour mid-year Professional Development will focus on ELL assessment, and  address the four modalities tested on the NYSESLAT; listening, speaking, reading, and  writing. Staff members will be informed of the various mandated assessments given to all  entitled ELLs, and methods for alternative assessments in the classroom, both formative and  summative.  The ENL teacher will also model how to align the N.Y.S Bilingual Progressions and  various ENL-based rubrics with the current Teacher's College curriculum rubrics and learning  progressions.  The two-hour end-of-year Professional Development will focus on student  progress, analyzing areas in need of improvement, identifying best practices, and identifying  possible alternative assessments which include periodic performance assessments and portfolio  reviews for future implementations.          The ENL teacher,  Ms. Rosemary Rutigliano, will also be sent on multiple Professional  Development workshops and trainings to stay informed of best practices and new  implementations, testing updates, and ENL regulations, throughout the year.  The ENL teacher  will turn key any new information to administration and staff, so that everyone is aware of how  to best support our ELLs.  Also, the ENL teacher will also meet with the classroom teachers of  ELLs once a week, throughout the school year to look at student work, collaborate with grade  teams to identify best practices, and offer differentiated instructional strategies that will best  meet the needs of our ELLs.     Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

At the  initial orientation meeting, parents will be provided with a questionnaire about the types of  workshops in which they would be interested, and their preferred method of       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    communication.  The initial orientation will take place in September, after school for 3 hours.  In  October, Back to School Night, Family/Curriculum Night, and Parent Teacher Conferences will  be utilized as an additional means to communicate student expectations, progress and  performance, in addition to conducting weekly phone calls and providing frequent notices  regarding student progress.  These conferences are also designed to provide the parents with  opportunities to learn about the curriculum and ask questions that they may have in relation to  curriculum support.       Our school also provides adult ENL classes for parents of ELLs on Mondays and  Wednesdays, in addition to computer literacy classes. These classes are held in the school  cafeteria from 8:30am to 11:30am.  The program runs for the duration of the entire academic  school year. This program will be run by the Parent Coordinator, Ms. Mai-Ling  Miranda.  Parents are always encouraged to attend every class. Ms. Mai-Ling Miranda reaches  out to all parents to be involved in all school activities.       Ms. Rosemary Rutigliano, our ENL teacher will conduct several parent workshops on  Tuesdays from 2:45 pm to 3:15 pm. Ms. Rosemary Rutigliano will explain how our  supplementary programs on Wednesdays and Saturdays will support our ELL students. ELL  families will learn how each program works. They will be able to learn about the Orton  Gillingham program and learn about the technology based program called Imagine Learning.  Parents of ELLs will be able to see materials and resources that each program offers and learn  how they are used in the supplementary programs. Laptops and i pads will be provided at parent  workshops for ELL families to learn how to navigate Imagine Learning. Ms. Rosemary  Rutigliano will provide parents of ELLs with a student log in card for Imagine Learning and with  an Imagine Learning parent letter in their home language. Also, during one of the parent  workshops our ELL students will present what they learned from these two supplementary  programs.          Our school progress reports and school report cards keep parents informed about school  expectations and benchmarks that students must meet.  All notices are sent home to parents in  their home language and in English.  Letters and flyers are to be translated through the use of the  Department of Education’s Translation Unit and/or by bilingual staff members if time is limited.  Workshops provided through Title III funding target prepares our  ELL students for N.Y.S.  standardized testing, strategies to build literacy and math skills at home, as well as sessions on  the Next Generation Learning Standards and Citywide expectations. These events are open to all  parents of ELLs, and are generally held every other month, on Tuesday's from 2:45pm -  4:45pm.         Our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Miranda will host several workshops throughout the school year  aimed at teaching parents ways to improve their child's academic progress.   The Language  Access Coordinator, Ms. Rosemary Rutigliano, ensures that any translation and interpretation  services (such as American Sign Language) are provided, through the N.Y.C D.O.E's Translation  and Interpretation Unit.  The goal is to support parents and improve the proficiency of their  English language acquisition, in addition to their child's.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 78 uses the RLAT results from the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL as a means of formative assessment to track student progress  and identify language proficiency levels, to inform instructional goals and interventions.  The RNMR is used to further identify  specific areas in need of improvement for linguistic reinforcement in the four modalities, identify interventions, as well as  inform intentional student grouping.  The Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System is used as an ongoing teacher- administered assessment that assesses phonics, fluency, oral accuracy, and literacy comprehension.  It is used to help inform  teachers of student proficiency levels in reading, listening, speaking, and writing.  Aligned with the Teacher's College Reading  and Writing Project, PS 78 uses curriculum-embedded assessments such as pre-unit and post-unit performance tasks, writing       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      process pieces, additional Teacher's College running records when necessary, and teacher-made tiered assessments, to inform  instructional grouping and additional intervention.  Reading and writing portfolios are also utilized to track student progress  and inform instructional decisions.  Aligned with Go Math and adapting supplemental resources from Engage NY, students are  given mathematical performance assessments offered in the home language as well as in English, pre-unit and post-unit  assessments, critical area performance assessments, and additional tiered-intervention assessments to reinforce skills that are  in need of improvement.  Math portfolios are also utilized to track student progress and inform instructional decisions, which  consist of all informal and summative assessments.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teacher teams such as the ELA team, the RTI Team, grade-leader teams, data team, math team, and curriculum planning  teams, analyze student work to identify trends and patterns in student strengths and areas in need of improvement.  The data  from the Fountas and Pinnell literacy assessments (which are running records and phonemic awareness, letter and word  recognition assessments), curriculum-embedded Teacher's College assessments (which measure reading comprehension and  writing skills), portfolio progress tracking, Go Math performance tasks, Engage NY performance tasks, critical area  performance assessments, and pre-and-post-unit assessments, are recorded on a spreadsheet for further analysis, to guide  instructional decisions and intervention strategies for struggling learners.  The ENL teacher filters all of this data to identify ELL  performance, and creates separate, ELL-specific data sheets.  The data is submitted to administration, where it is further  analyzed and discussed with the appropriate teacher teams to collaborate on finding best practices to support the ELLs. The  school principal ensures that during the teacher team meetings, teachers reflect on instructional practices, and collaborate to  identify best practices that will best support student needs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Prerequisite skills inventory assessments in math and ELA are administered in the beginning of the year to determine the prior  knowledge of each student.  Grade-level baseline assessments are administered to determine the content area proficiency  levels of each student, and the results are used to guide instruction and further  intervention when needed. Periodic  performance assessments, middle-of-the-year assessments, and end-of-the-year assessments are administered to assess the  critical area skills in mathematics and English Language Arts.  All of these assessments are used as summative and  baseline/benchmark assessments to identify a baseline, student progress, and areas in need of improvement.  All in-class  summative assessments are aligned with the Teacher's College and Go Math curricula.  The results of the NYSITELL are used as  a baseline for English proficiency, and the NYSESLAT results have been used as a measure of student progress over the school  year.  In 2018-2019 we plan to adapt the ELL Periodic Assessments to further analyze the progress of our ELLs and  communicate best practices to support them.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data is gathered from the assessments, it is analyzed by the classroom teacher and grade teams, then  when applicable it is shared with the appropriate teacher team(s) to determine the next steps for intervention.  The RTI Team  is also included in the data analysis for further instructional support, when necessary.  Collaboratively, the teacher and  appropriate team(s), including the RTI Team, Data Analysis Team, ENL teacher, and administration, implement strategies,  interventions, and additional support services as needed.  School leadership ensures that staff are implementing the  interventions in the areas of need for the ELLs by conducting classroom walk-throughs, attending weekly teacher team  meetings and grade meetings, and collecting monthly data to analyze student trends and implementations.  School leadership  ensures that  staff members are implementing the interventions in the areas of needs for the ELLs by monitoring RTI and  AIS team meetings, as well as attending grade-team meetings to ensure data analysis and collaboration in finding best  practices.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74         Universal school-wide screening, such as NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, and classroom screenings, such as prerequisite  skills/baseline and benchmark assessments, are conducted.  If an ELL student is flagged as at-risk or below-benchmark on any  particular skill, competency, or modality, the student should receive targeted instructional support to bolster development in  this area. This support should be delivered in coordination with language support services. Core (Tier I) instruction is analyzed  and reflected on to determine ELLs’ sources of difficulties.  Information about the learner, his or her classroom experiences,  and his or her home and community context is gathered by the teacher to draw on multiple sources of information, and best  meet the needs of the learner.  Multiple in-class interventions and individualized strategies addressing social and life skills, and  peer-interaction, purposeful development of language and literacy across the curriculum, leveraging student funds of  knowledge and skills as a foundation to making lessons meaningful, the development of cognitively challenging thinking skills,  and building students ’ abilities to form, express, and exchange ideas through conversation occur before consulting the RTI  Team for further ELL support.  Intensive, targeted intervention is designed by the teacher and RTI team, if the ELLs are  struggling to meet grade-level content or linguistic expectations. Teachers provide the RTI team with an explanation of how  instruction was differentiated to address native and second language concerns, a description of the amount and type of  instructional strategies attempted (including ENL instruction), an explanation of whether or not native language support was  used, a description of the amount and type of native language instruction (when applicable/as appropriate), an identification  of specific skills and competencies that need further intervention (Tiers 2 and 3), and the extent, if any, to which ENL  instruction and/or native language instruction is needed during such interventions.  Once a plan and additional supports are in  place for a struggling learner, the teacher and teams monitor the effectiveness of the supports to determine whether a child is  making improvements and to ensure that any necessary mid-course alterations are implemented. Progress monitoring data is  used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and/or services; as well as whether to consider a  referral for special education services, if necessary.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, NYS Common Core Exam, and classroom assessment (common core learning standards and- currculum-aligned rubrics, checklists, success criteria, and benchmark and unit assessment data analysis spreadsheets)  outcomes are used to inform student grouping, instructional goals and strategies and interventions, in addition to  approproiate programming.  The assessment data is used to evaluate and inform PS 78's Title III ENL programs such as after  school and weekend programming, and RTI decisions for AIS grouping.  Once students are placed in the ELL programs, the  classroom and ENL teacher consistently analyzes data to monitor student progress and guide decisions as to whether or not  changes are necessary.   The ELL Data Analysis tool is used to focus on the progress toward achievement of language and  academic proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs, and the design of effective instructional programs and/or interventions for  those students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The RTI teams, teacher teams, and data team meet regularly to collaborate with administration and the ENL teacher to analyze  data spreadsheets that track student progress.  The findings are shared with the students and all stakeholders to keep lines of  communication open, and to ensure that the students are being fully supported in all aspects.  Thereafter, the teams  determine appropriate adjustments to the programs and student grouping, while considering input from the families.   School  leadership collects all data spreadsheets monthly and shares all information with grade-level teacher teams and the  appropriate teacher leader teams such as the RTI Team (when applicable),  Data Analysis Team, Curriculum Mapping and  Assessment Teams, and AIS Teams.  School leadership periodically meets with the corresponding teams to ensure that the  ELLs are being supported according to the data analysis discussed in the weekly meetings and monthly data collections.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 78  has a total of 76 ELLs.  The RLAT and RNMR are used to decipher English proficiency levels, which dictate ELL  programming.  Entering and Emerging  students receive 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction during the  scheduled school day as required under CR Part 154. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes per  week of ENL instruction during the scheduled school day.  Commanding students will receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL instruction. The Freestanding ENL Program services the students in 36 minute blocks per day, each  day.  The blocks that are standalone ENL instruction are for Entering and Emerging students, totaling 180 minutes per  week, and are split by two-level grade bands.  The integrated instruction consists of one block for each grade, K-5,  that includes all levels of language proficiency, heterogeneously grouped.  All ELLs are heterogeneously grouped into  one class per grade making it possible for the integrated ENL/ELA instructional program to occur.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     PS 78 does not currently have a TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      PS 78 does not currently have a DL program.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in the ENL  program with schedules approved by the District 31 ENL specialists, and by internal school leadership.  Entering and Emerging  students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, Transitioning and Expanding  students receive 180 minutes of ENL  instruction per week, and Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week  during the school day.  All  schedules are in compliance with CR Part 154. The  ENL program at PS 78 delivers instruction in English 100% of the time by a  New York State certified ENL teacher. New York State Learning Standards are used to teach English in a content-based cross- curricular format, using ENL methodologies and scaffolding strategies to support the ELLs as needed. Standards-based  instruction is implemented in the four modalities of language skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing in English with the  support of the ENL Bilingual Learning Progressions. ENL teacher pushes into designated classes on each grade to support the  general education teacher in meeting the needs of our ELLs in an integrated, co-teaching model using scaffolding techniques  such as modeling, accessing prior knowledge, explicit and immediate peer-and-teacher- feedback, bridging, peer-assistance  pairs/groups, schema-building, text representation, metacognition and self-assessment with various rubrics and  checklists.  The ENL teacher also pulls students out of the general education classrooms (and special education classrooms  when applicable) for a standalone period in a small-group instructional setting to meet the mandated minutes for Entering and  Emerging ELLs, focusing on language development.  The areas in need of improvement are identified during common planning  periods among the grade teams and the ENL teacher.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL program delivers instruction in English, and aligns instructional activities with the core content. The integrated co- teaching ENL program supports Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project by providing scaffolded approaches to the  curriculum, and simultaneous language support.  The integrated model is a collaborative approach to the classroom setting, in  that the ENL teacher and classroom teacher work alongside each other to deliver instruction through a Universal Design for       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76      Learning.  The program is student-centered and reflective and expressive, in that students constantly self-and-peer- assess their work, work in small groups and pairs, and provide and receive explicit, written and oral feedback using  checklists, rubrics and student exemplars to guide their work.  The general education teacher delivers the core instruction  aligned with the NYS Learning Standards, while the ENL teacher scaffolds and supports instruction with further analysis and  break-down of the skills, activating prior knowledge and developing vocabulary through various instructional strategies and  activities that are differentiated to meet the linguistic and cognitive needs of each ELL.  The standalone ENL  model supplements the content being taught in the ELLs' classrooms, and addressing areas in need of improvement which are  discussed between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher during common planning time and teacher team meetings,  with a focus on language development.   Both program models utilize additional strategies and materials such as differentiated  graphic organizers, bilingual libraries, translating texts/directions, bilingual dictionaries, facilitating intentional grouping,  bilingual and illustrated dictionaries, and instruction in academic vocabulary using knowledge of the home language to support  learning.  Both program models require rigorous and intensive co-planning, and the ENL teacher is directly involved in that  planning process during teacher team meetings and grade meetings.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   PS 78 ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year.  Upon admittance, students  are given an assessment in their home language and in English, to assess language and content proficiency.  The NYSITELL and  Spanish LAB are administered when applicable.   The Spanish LAB is used to further support teachers in instructional planning  in providing bilingual and ENL services to the Spanish-speaking students who already took the NYSITELL.  Bilingual staff  members are utilized whenever possible to conduct oral assessments, and to translate written assessments when  applicable.  Translators and translated materials are provided as needed to further support the assessment pieces.  Many  classroom assessments, including Fountas and Pinnell, unit assessments, performance assessments, and rubrics and checklists  are given to the students in their home language in addition to English.  Teachers utilize bilingual staff members to translate  classroom assessments when written assessments or texts in are not readily accessible.  ELLs have the opportunity to complete  assessments in their home language, as well as completing the assessment in English to the best of their  ability.  Quarterly portfolio reviews are conducted by classroom teachers, the ENL teachers, administration, and specific  teacher teams (when necessary) to assess student progress and determine appropriate interventions and programming for  ELLs.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE: PS 78 currently has two SIFE students; one in the third grade and one in fourth grade. These SIFE students  have attended schools in the United States for less than twelve months and are two or more years below grade level in literacy  in their home language and/or two or more years below grade level in mathematics due to inconsistent or interrupted  schooling prior to arrival in the US. Once the SIFE students are performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level on  the NYSESLAT, the student’s status as a SIFE will be removed, but the student may continue to be identified as an ELL, in which  case they will continue to receive ENL services.  The plan will follow  mandated minutes of instruction as needed.  There is a  center set up in the classrooms that benefits SIFE students, which includes picture dictionaries, books in the home language,  leveled books, audio books, headphones, and access to programs and software on iPads and laptops such as RazKids, Imagine  Learning, and Vocabulary A-Z.  The teachers use scaffolding techniques and ENL methodology to bring the student up to grade- level proficiency. The teachers have built a comfortable environment so the student feels safe to make mistakes, and safe to  participate in discussions and group activities.   b. Newcomer: Currently, PS 78 has 36 newcomers.  These students have received ENL instruction for a total of zero (0) to three  (3) continuously enrolled school years in the US.   The newcomer receives the mandated 360 minutes per week of ENL  instruction during the school day. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to make sure the students' needs       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77      are met.  The ENL teacher differentiates instruction for newcomers by providing picture dictionaries, bilingual glossaries and  dictionaries, beginning reader books, audio books, books in the home language, a set of earphones and a radio in the general  education classrooms that consist of ELLs.  The newcomers also have access to iPads and laptops and software such as  Compass Learning/Pathblazer, Imagine Learning, Vocabulary A-Z and Raz-Kids.  These students participate in AIS, SETSS (when  applicable) and Title III supplemental instructional support, and receive scaffolded instruction to activate prior knowledge and  build on schema through the use of differentiated and translated materials, illustrated materials (such as texts and directions),  and repetition in small-group settings.  c. Developing: Currently, PS 78 has 10 ELLs that are developing.  The developing ELLS have received ENL instruction for a total  of four (4) to six (6) continuously enrolled school years in the US.  These students participate in intense remediation focusing  on higher order thinking concepts and questioning, in addition to building content-based vocabulary through  scaffolded instructional strategies and additional remedial support such as after school programming. These students  participate in AIS, SETSS (when applicable) and supplemental instructional support through Title III Program.  These students  also have access to iPads and laptops to use i-Ready, Raz-Kids, and Compass Learning/Pathblazer, which build upon vocabulary  and are used as a supplemental support for developing academic vocabulary aligned with the NYS Learning Standards.  d. Long Term: Currently, PS 78 does not have any long term ELLs.  If PS 78 were to have long term ELLs, they would have  received ENL instruction for seven (7) or more continuously enrolled school years in the US.  These students would participate  in the integrated co-teaching model, where the ENL teacher provides instructional support in the general education classroom,  supporting the long-term ELLs in vocabulary development and home language support when necessary, when scaffolding core  instruction.  e. Former ELLs: At this time our school has 3 former ELLs. These students will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  instruction per week. They still are entitled to additional modifications and accommodations (such as extended time on tests),  when necessary, in addition to any other specific modifications that may be indicated on an IEP, when applicable. They are  entitled to participate in Title III after school programming and weekend programming throughout the school year. These  students have access to Compass Learning/Pathblazer and Imagine Learning as a supplemental means of supporting the core  instruction.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers of ELL-SWD  use in our school are the Teacher's College  Reading and Writing Project curriculum for grades K-5, and Ortin Gillingham for struggling learners in need of additional  support in reading, spelling, and writing.  These programs lend themselves to tiered academic support, in addition to English  language development  These programs have listening-strand lessons comprised of teacher read-alouds with extensive  activities and ample opportunity for peer interaction and group work for peer-support.  Graphic organizers, manipulatives,  visuals, charts, anchor charts, student reference sheets, dictionaries, glossaries, and teacher-directions are all differentiated to  meet the academic and individual needs of each student, and accelerate English language development.   Formative  assessments are included with each lesson through checks for comprehension, self-assessment, peer-assessment, student-led  conferences, and explicit, immediate feedback.  The TC program is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers adapt the lessons to meet IEP goals and the goals identified with the RTI Team and the ENL teacher.  PS 78 uses the  GoMath curriculum for all grade levels, with adaptations from Engage NY.  The program assesses before and after each lesson  and there are mid-unit checkpoints, and opportunities for interventions and reinforcement as well as enrichment activities and  assessments. RTI -and-ELL-specific activities are embedded in the program. This program is aligned with the Common Core  Learning Standards. Teachers adapt the lessons to meet the needs of IEP goals and the goals of the RTI Team and the ENL  teacher. PS 78 offers the technology program called Compass Learning/Pathblazer, that is accessible to all students, and  individualizes its instruction and assessments to asses each student's strengths and areas in need of improvement. Title III  offers small groups and individualized supplemental support to all ELLs after school and on weekends. PS 78 has a SETSS  teacher and AIS teachers that offer additional instructional support during the school day.  PS 78 also offers after school and  weekend programs that address specific student needs, such as the ELL Academy, 1-2 Academy, and 3-4-5 Academies.  Each  academy addresses the needs of the students in that specific subgroup, using data collected by the classroom teachers,  SETTS teacher, RTI  Team, and the ENL teacher to inform instruction and activities.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teacher co-plans with the classroom teachers and IEP teachers during common planning times, which is embedded  into the school-day schedule.  This includes the special education teacher who teaches ELL-SWDs.  There are ample  opportunities to meet throughout the week during common preparation periods, during the Monday professional learning  time, during "Team Tuesday," time, which is after parent-engagement time, and during the Curriculum Planning Team time,  after school on Thursdays.  The least restrictive program for ELL-SWDs is the integrated co-teaching model, where the ENL  teacher co-teaches with the general and special education teachers.  The ENL teacher's schedule is collaboratively designed to  align with the classroom teacher's schedule, so that the content delivered in the integrated model is aligned with the ELL- SWD's areas in need of improvement and IEP goals, in addition to the CR-Part 154.  All work is aligned with the NYS Learning  Standards, and is scaffolded to support language development in addition to the skills that the ELL-SWD must meet identified  on the IEP.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS 78's classroom teachers use Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project for the ELA Curriculum. Intervention such as  small group instruction, peer-activities, and one-to-one conferencing to further develop skills is embedded in these programs,  and teacher-made assessments and activities are created collaboratively among teacher teams and the ENL teacher during  common planning time. Other targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA include Raz-Kids, and Vocabulary A-Z in grades K- 2, which help develop vocabulary and language skills and supplement instruction, and Compass Learning/Pathblazer in grades  3-5, which supplements the core instruction and focuses on academic content-based skills and vocabulary.  Reading Rescue is  used as an intervention for ELLs in ELA in grade 1 for further literacy/phonics support.  Orton Gillingham is used as an  intervention program for the ELL-SWDs, and further supports them in literacy development in all grades.  Imagine Learning is a  supplemental language-development software which all ELLs have access to.  All of the programs are scaffolded to meet the  needs of the individual student, and have materials that are offered in multiple languages.  PS 78's SETTS teacher and  AIS teachers also pull students out of the classroom for specific, additional support when applicable.  PS 78 also offers Title III  after school and weekend programming that targets different skills of varying proficiency levels.  When programs do not offer  support in the home language, bilingual staff members are designated to entering and emerging ELLs, as well as ELL-SWDs to  readily assist with translation services.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends analyzed by the RTI team, ELA team, math team, data team, and teacher teams, which indicate that  our ELLs are lacking in academic and basic vocabulary (depending on proficiency levels), PS 78 is considering adapting Achieve  3000 software for the upcoming school year, to supplement core content and help improve our ELL's academic vocabulary  through individualized instruction and assessment.  MaxScholar is also being considered to adapt for the lower grades (K-2), as  a supplemental support for early literacy and entering ELLs, as well as ELL-SWDs.  PS 78 also plans to implement the  ELL Periodic Assessments for the 2018-2019 school year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently, PS 78 does not have a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All after school and supplemental programs are offered to every child at PS 78, including ELLs.  Title III after school and  weekend programs are available specifically for ELLs, in addition to programs that are available to all students, which include  academic after school programs for Common Core state test-readiness, enrichment programs, band program, basketball  programs, and track programs.   The parent coordinator works with the ENL teachers to invite ELLs into the programs by  providing translated permission slips and by conducting follow-up telephone contact to ensure ELL participation in the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79      programs.  School leadership ensures that ELL students are attending the various programs by maintaining accurate  attendance records, and analyzing the attendance trends to implement next steps as to whether or not parent outreach is  being conducted effectively.  If programs do not have adequate participation or attendance among the ELLs, further parent  outreach is conducted, in addition to informational community and parent-workshops when necessary.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The technologically instructional materials used to support the ELLs in the general education classroom during the integrated  co-teaching periods include Smart Boards, iPads, and laptops to utilize supplemental programs such as Reading A-Z, Raz-Kids,  Vocabulary A-Z, Starfall, Imagine Learning, and Compass Learning/Pathblazer.  The classrooms that consist of ELLs have  bilingual dictionaries, bilingual reading materials in the classroom library, differentiated graphic organizers (which are  translated when necessary), translated glossaries, and foster constant small group instruction and peer-interactions to build  social skills and trust among the classroom community.  Fountas and Pinnell reading running records, word study materials and  assessments, word and letter recognition materials and assessments, and additional supplemental assessments are further  used to support ELLs.  Orton Gillingham phonics and literacy materials and assessments are also used to support ELL- SWDs.  Differentiated leveled-texts and tiered learning progressions, created by the ENL teacher, are used to accompany the  Teacher's College curriculum, so that the ELLs are working independently on the core content skills, to their own capabilities, in  alignment with their English proficiency.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is assessed and delivered in the integrated co-teaching model by the ENL teachers, general education  teachers, and special education teachers, in the general education or ICT classroom settings.  Every assessment that is given is  translated orally by a bilingual staff member, or provided in written form in English and in the ELL's home language.  The  classrooms have bilingual libraries and content area materials to support independent practice of skills as well.   The ENL  teacher also provides each teacher of ELLs with bilingual student-readers, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and  scaffolded and differentiated graphic organizers which are translated from English to the home language when necessary.  In  the integrated model, the ENL teacher supplements the core instruction by scaffolding NYS Learning Standards to meet the  linguistic and cognitive needs of each ELL, including ELL-SWDs.  In the standalone model, the ENL teacher focuses on specific  areas in need of improvement, identified on classroom assessments and NYSITELL and NYSESLAT modalities.  The ELLs and ELL- SWDs are assessed in the home language and in English, so that all teachers of ELLs are aware of the ELLs' strengths and areas  in need of improvement in the home language and in English.  PS 78 currently does not have a DL or TBE program.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels at PS 78. Upon arrival in the beginning of the year,  students are given baseline and prerequisite skills inventory assessments.  In the middle and end of the year, the ELLs are given  similar assessments that cover the skills that correspond to that specific time of year. These assessments are given in English  and in the home language when necessary, and they appropriately assess grade-level content proficiency, which helps inform  instructional decisions to further support the ELLs according to their age and grade levels.  For ELLs who are below or  significantly below grade-level expectations/proficiency, the assessment data is analyzed and further academic support is  implemented.  The ENL teacher scaffolds instruction to reinforce skills that the ELLs need further development in, as well as  reinforcing grade-level content. Materials and instruction correspond to the New York State Learning Standards according to  grade and age levels. Differentiated instruction is delivered according to needs of each ELL, but in alignment with the  NYS Learning Standards for content-based support.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 78 currently does not share the building.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs complete a battery of assessments upon arrival, and before beginning the school year in their new class  placements.  The assessments will be conducted in English and in the home languages, in addition to being given grade-level  content-based assessments.  This informs the teachers of ELLs of their instructional decisions and grouping strategies to  support the newly enrolled ELLs most effectively.  When an ELL is newly enrolled, a team of students (one student who is the  same age as the new admit, one who is younger, and one who is older), accompany the ENL teacher in providing the newly  enrolled ELL with a tour of the school.  The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to make sure the student's  needs are met and that they are participating in the appropriate academic and linguistic-based support services throughout  the school year. Throughout the year, newcomer ELLs have the opportunity to participate in Title III after-school and weekend  programs. Student-led portfolio reviews are also conducted to showcase pieces of student work that the ELLs are most proud  of, and to discuss student progress. The ENL teacher provides the teachers delivering instruction to the newcomer ELLs with a  portfolio of scaffolded strategies and differentiated materials, including alternate assessments with home language support,  and additional materials that include a bilingual, illustrated picture dictionary and glossary, and translated materials.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are currently no language electives offered at PS 78.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   There are currently no dual language programs at PS 78.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  PS 78's professional development program will be continuous and informative for all staff responsible for delivery of  instruction and services to ELLs. In order for our ELLs to be successful, the teachers must be fully equipped with a bank of  knowledge and resources as to how to best meet the needs of each student, holistically.    The ENL teacher will conduct a beginning-of-year Professional Development workshop to explain ENL terminology and  programming, in-class scaffolding, differentiated instruction, language support, supplemental programs that enhance linguistic  development, and general resources to support ELLs.  The staff will be informed of instructional strategies and scaffolding  approaches to ELL instruction, in addition to the ELL identification and placement process.  The ENL teacher will also provide  teachers of ELLs with a portfolio of tools, materials, and resources needed to fully support their ELLs academically, socially, and  emotionally.      The ENL teacher will also facilitate a Professional Development in the middle of the year, focusing on appropriate assessment  for ELLs, and one following this PD session which will address the four modalities tested on the NYSESLAT; listening, reading,  writing and speaking. Staff members will be informed of the various mandated assessments given to  all ELLs (including NYSITELL), in addition to alternative assessments including periodic performance assessments, portfolio       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81         reviews, and formative and summative assessments.  The ENL teacher will also show how to align the Bilingual Progressions  and various ENL rubrics with the current curriculum rubrics.  At the end of the school year, the ENL teacher will facilitate a final  professional development session which will allow for data analysis and reflections of student progress, to identify areas in  need of improvement and discuss best practices in supporting the ELLs.  The PD will also address ways to support home  language and content-based instruction at home, to prepare the ELLs for the following academic year.  The PD will be to  support the families of ELLs by providing the teachers of ELLs with opportunities for parents of ELLs to learn the content and  vocabulary itself, as well as providing them with ways of sharing the learning process with their children throughout the  summer.    The ENL teacher, Danielle DiChiaro, will also be sent on multiple Professional Development workshops and trainings to stay  informed of best practices and new implementations, testing updates, and ENL regulations, throughout the year.  The ENL  teacher will turkey any new information to administration and staff, so that everyone is aware of how to best support  our ELLs  The ENL teacher will also meet once a week, throughout the school year to look at student work, collaborate with  grade teams to identify best practices, and offer differentiated instructional strategies that will best meet the needs of  the ELLs.      Tentative Internal Professional Development Schedule (Facilitated by the ENL Teacher):  September 2018:  ENL 101: Supporting ELLs in the Classroom  November 2018: Assessing ELLs Appropriately  January/February 2019: NYSESLAT Workshop; Setting Our ELLs up for Success  May 2019: ENL Reflections & Data Analysis     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Every Monday there is extended day for Professional Development at PS 78 for all the teachers, including teachers of ELLs.  These workshops are facilitated by administrators, pedagogues and classroom teachers. Workshops will be scheduled to meet  the new mandates of CR Part 154 (15%  ENL workshops for teachers of ELLs).  The payroll secretary will maintain agendas and  attendance for the non-ELL teachers as well as the ENL teachers in the school.  The ENL teachers will facilitate 4-5 staff-wife  Professional Development sessions throughout the year, as well as facilitating informal, monthly informational sessions for  teachers of ELLs.   The Professional Development sessions will address language acquisition, including a focus on best practices  for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  The Dissemination  Grant will continue through the 2017-2018 school year, to reflect on teacher planning and practices that align with the  Danielson Framework.  The grant includes a cohort of teachers and an administrator, and inter-visitations to other schools, as  well as participating school visitations to PS 78, occur to identify areas in need of improvement within the domains of the  Danielson Framework.  The exposure to other schools' instruction and the collaborative nature of the grant allows the  participating teachers to identify best practices and turn key strategies to help align instruction with the Danielson Framework,  and best support our students, including ELLs.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?

Bilingual staff members are utilized when needed, if translations are necessary, in addition to utilizing the  DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents are welcomed to every activity at PS 78.  The Parent Coordinator conducts daily and/or weekly outreach to all parents  involving them in every program and event, including anything involving their specific child.  All outreach materials are sent  home, posted in English, and translated to Spanish and Arabic.  If any other language is needed, the NYC DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit is utilized. Specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs include orientation  meetings, introductory meetings, informative Title III programming meetings,  parent workshops such as computer literacy  programs, and English workshops.  Parents of ELLs are always encouraged to attend teacher meetings and parent-teacher  conferences, as well as classroom celebrations at the end of each unit.  ELL parent involvement will also include portfolio  reviews, which the ELLs will maintain as progress monitors to show their growth linguistically and academically.  The ENL  teacher also arranges for the parents of our ELLs to meet with the ENL teacher and classroom teacher quarter-annually to  review and analyze the contents of the ELL portfolio, and identify linguistic and content-based strengths and next steps.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Louis Bruschi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           84                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 78                                                                              School DBN: 31R078  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess the language preferences of the parent community for both written  and oral communication primarily comes from the language indicated by the parents/guardians on the Home  Language Identification survey. Our school also utilizes the data generated from the RHLA and RAPL in ATS. If the  language is determined anything other than English, then written and oral translations are provided as needed.  Currently, the language preferences of the parent community are Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, Mandarin, and  Spanish. PS 78 has pedagogues fluent in all languages preferred by the parent community for both written and  oral communication. If another language is required, then the DOE's Translation and Interpretation unit will be  utilized. The student Emergency Contact Cards are kept in the main office, filed alphabetically and subdivided into  classes/grades, in addition to being filed in the appropriate classrooms. The ENL teacher holds a copy of the  Emergency Contact Cards in the student records binder, which include all ENL documents such as a copy of the  Home Language Survey (the original is stored in the students' cumulative records), ELL Parent Option Survey,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86      Placement Letters, and any other important and relevant student documents. Service providers also may hold a  copy of the student emergency contact cards, which also indicate the language preferences of the parent  community.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   Arabic   English   Spanish   Arabic   Mandarin   Mandarin   75.75   21.87   1.35   0   English   Spanish   Arabic   Mandarin   75.13   22.18   1.35   0.1           3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     -English   -Spanish          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   Families    School calendar & newsletters/  administrative notes   Monthly/ weekly   Report Cards, IEP Notices, & Parent  Teacher Announcements//Notices    Quarter-annually   How do you plan to translate? Include  procedures to ensure timely provision  of translated documents to parents.    The documents are divided into sections  that are translated into the specific  languages that the families speak.  Documents are translated using the  Translations Unit or internally by a staff  member who speaks/writes in the  preferred home language of our parent  community.   The documents are translated according  to the specific language that the families  speak. The preferred language of report  cards is submitted by the Pupil  Accounting Secretary to be generated in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87      NYS Testing Memos, School Events or  Closure Announcements/Notices   As-need basis   After-school Program Information/  General overview of student curriculum/  Letters from school leadership/ Class  Trip Notices   As-need basis   the appropriate languages. Teachers can  submit a request for all other  documents, such as IEP Notices and  Parent Teacher  Announcements/Notices, with the  Language Access Coordinator. The LAC  then utilizes the DOE's Translation and  Interpretation Unit, and the Office of  Sign Language Interpreting Services  when necessary.   The documents are divided into sections  that are translated into the specific  languages in which the families prefer to  receive written information. Documents  in need of translation are submitted by  the LAC to the DOE's Translations Unit,  or executed internally by a staff  member who can write in the preferred  language.   The documents are divided into sections  that are translated into the specific  languages in which the families prefer to  receive written information.

When necessary, the LAC, ENL  Teacher, and other teachers utilize the  DOE's Translation Unit for over-the- phone interpretation.   3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      All staff members who speak a language other than English are readily available for interpretation services over-the- phone and in-person, in the event of a school emergency. If the emergency is not immediate, notices will be  translated and distributed to the students as soon as possible, in addition to the Parent Coordinator and classroom  teachers making phone calls to inform parents, with oral translations from staff members provided as needed. The  DOE Translation Unit Over-the-Phone service will be utilized to assist with over-the-phone communication, in the case  that there are not enough available staff members who speak the necessary home languages.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      In the beginning of the school year, all pedagogues are to meet during a professional learning session to review and  analyze the Chancellor's Regulation A-663. All staff members are given a copy of the regulations, and the facilitator of  the professional development explains that as per the CR Part A-663, the Translation and Interpretation Unit within  the Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy is responsible for providing language access support to families and  parent leaders. The English as a New Language Teacher/Language Access Coordinator (LAC) constructs staff-wide  emails quarter-annually encouraging all school personnel to utilize the DOE's language access resources, in  accordance with the Chancellor's Regulation A-663. In the beginning of the year, the English as a New Language  teachers facilitate a Professional Learning session that explains the resources offered by the DOE's language access  services, and provides a demonstration on how to submit written resources to be translated. The ENL Teacher/LAC  also expresses the updated items of the CR Part A-663, stating that students may not provide translation services, and  that the LAC and Parent Coordinator should be utilized when seeking language access support or requirements.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           89       Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      During the beginning of the year "PS 78 Family and Curriculum Night" and ELL and student orientations, parents are  made aware of their rights to receive information in oral and written form, which are both provided in the preferred  language of the parents. Brochures, flyers and letters are frequently distributed informing the parents of their rights  to receive information, and this is addressed at every IEP meeting, parent-teacher conference, ENL parent meeting,  parent engagement/outreach session on Tuesdays after school, and during any informal parent-teacher meetings or  parent workshops. Translated signage is posted on the safety agent's desk, so that the parents who cannot  communicate English can point to their preferred language, and the safety agent can inform the Parent Coordinator  and Language Access Coordinator. Upon registering their child, each parent whose primary language is a covered  language and who require language assistance services is provided with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and  Responsibilities. The document includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. They are also  made aware that translated versions of this document, in the covered languages, are available at  http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/Parents+Bill+of+Rights+and+Respo nsiblities.htm. This is  communicated primarily by the ENL Teacher upon registration. During Family Night/Back to School Night, ENL  Orientation, and every school-or-grade-wide ENL parent-teacher conference, all parents are provided with the Bill of  Parent Rights and Responsibilities         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The mechanisms PS 78 will use to gather feedback from parents on the quality and the availability of services are the  parent surveys and feedback forms, in addition to any teacher-made surveys throughout and at the end of the school  year. PS 78 has implemented the feedback to improve language services by opening parent workshops for English  proficiency and computer literacy, which was a need expressed on a past parent survey. Surveys will be provided in  other languages through the use of internal translators/ fluent-speaking staff members of languages other than  English, and through the use of the NYC DOE Translations and Interpretations Unit.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           90
