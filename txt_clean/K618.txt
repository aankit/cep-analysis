This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      Our Mission       The Academy of Innovative Technology High School provides a foundation and pathway on which students can build  their academic successes and triumph over their challenges. Our innovation lies in exploring inventive ideas,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      perspectives, and strategies; incorporating technology into the learning process; and presenting opportunities for  students to grow as lifelong learners and active citizens.      As graduates, AoITHS students will be open-minded, believe in taking risks, learn from their mistakes, and participate  in shaping their intellectual behavior thereby realizing their own potential and responsibility for bringing change to  their communities and to the global society.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our Shared Belief : Every child, in every classroom with every teacher has the ability to learn. Therefore:   ● In an increasingly fast-paced competitive world, students need to ask important questions and solve real-world  problems concerning technological advancements, the constant changes within the global economy; the community,  and the environment while making strong connections to high school academics. Thus, theory, use of technology and  direct application are integrated into every student’s program of study.   ● To respond to the high national dropout rate of urban students, the school provides a holistic personalized  educational environment that works on the development of students’ life skills, habits of reflection and individual  vision for a better future. We do so through Youth Development Empowerment Program (YELP, mentoring and  projects, within the school and beyond.   ● In order to develop the leadership capacities that successful employees of the future will need, the school’s  instructional program and cultural activities will help students take responsibility for their own learning by setting  goals, working in teams, developing individual portfolios, reflective journals and logs, participating in leadership  workshops, having field-based experiences, participating in career and college awareness activities.   ● To meet the demands of a fast paced quick response society the school fosters high expectations and provides  multiple support systems that will support students to cultivate their inner-strengths and confidence.   ● To demonstrate that they are the best and most qualified to enter any institution whether it is a college, a  technology apprenticeship, or a corporation - students are taking academically rigorous course work and technology  classes that ends with industry certification exams. These learning opportunities enable students to build academic  and technical skills needed to be accepted in apprenticeships, or post-secondary institutions.   ● To be a truly well-rounded individual connected to urban and global life, students need cultural activities that are  academically and creatively structured involving art, music, museums that cut across all segments of the community,  so the school provides these experiences for students.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our special student population includes 25% SPED Education students and 10% ENL students as of June 23, 2018. As  well, at this juncture we are service an 82.89% male population due to the extensive technology programs in our  school and are expecting to have 136 new incoming 9th grade students as of Fall 2018. These students specifics needs  vary, but include ICT & ENL Teachers, SETSS, counseling, social emotional support, AIS (academic intervention  services- Saturday tutoring, after school prep), and differentiated curriculum.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Key Areas of Success in the Framework for Great Schools (FGS)      Collaborative Teachers   Throughout the 2017-2018 our teachers worked collaboratively in various teachers teams in order to support student  achievement at the Academy of Innovative Technology High School. Collaboration happened on various levels and the  following teacher teams were established: Parent Involvement Team, Instructional Advancement Team (IAS),  Continuous Improvement Plan, Problem of Practice Teams, Attendance Team, Future NOW (Post Secondary Planning  Team), Respect, Identity, and Development Team (RID), ENL Lunch & Learn Team, and whole staff professional  development was embedded into our weekly work scheduled. Teachers at AoIT also have circular six planning time  where teachers are invited to work in small inquiry teams on a weekly basis in order to collectively support student  achievement & growth.    Effective School Leadership   This year was transition of leadership at AoIT as the former founding Principal retired and the Assistant Principal of 7  years prior transitioned into the role of Principal. As well, former literacy coach was appointed as Interim Acting  Assistant Principal in February 2018. Furthermore, the school had 4 Lead PCT Teachers and 1 Model Teacher to  support teachers throughout the school year. The philosophy at AoIT is one of shared leadership where teachers and  administration were together to share the responsibilities within the school community. This includes have Content  and Grade Team Leaders to support the academic success of students.    Key Areas of Focus: Rigorous Instruction    This year each teacher team at AoIT engaged in a Problem of Practice (POP- Teacher Centered Inquiry) in order to  support the success of students. Below you will find the topic of POP for each specific content area:     CTE: How can the use of practice tests and vocabulary assessments be used by the CTE Department to      improve the technical assess passing rate of graduating seniors to 50%? /Goal: Improve technical assessment  passing rate to 50%  Social Studies: How can we implement instruction that will address the new format of the Global History  Regents?/By June 2018 all Social Studies Teachers will have implemented at least one activity per month  aimed at improving students ability to analyze historical documents and political cartoons.      Math: Can having students use a graphic organizer that has them identity information and write out the steps   to solving problem help students on longer, wordy word problems?/To improve student performance and  stamina on part 2, 3, & 4 of all Math Regents exams by June 2018 by having students use a graphic organizer  to organize information & their thoughts (Castle Learning, Imagine Math)      ELA: How to encourage and support students in developing a “love” of reading? We want students to read   and become aware of their feelings and thoughts about the characters, plot, and message. We want to  develop student reflection, make a connection, raise questions, and become curious readers./ Reduce the  number of students by half that said they did not read any books in DEAR last year (20% to 10%) by June  2018. By June 2018, reduce the number of students who said they don’t read because there are “No good  books” (49% to 35%) and that reading is “boring” (66% to 50%) based on strategies we will put into practice:  teachers developing a better understanding of their libraries, and having students share out about the books  they are reading on a weekly basis. By June 2018, student responses to the question that they “have never  read for enjoyment” will lower by 10% (from 43.1 to 33.1%).

Mentor Mentee Program:      The current Peer Mentorship Project at our school was founded this school year as a result of our bi-weekly      grade team meetings. The 9th grade team identified a group of students who they felt needed significant  support in order to be academically successful. Throughout the process teachers realized that the support  students needed was multi-dimensional—emotional and organizational as well as academic. Through  meetings and discussions we realized that mentors, other students near in age but who were academically  successful and emotionally mature, could provide the much-needed support and guidance our 9th grade  students needed.   In part 9th grade teachers reached out to the 11th grade team to identify potential 11th grade mentors who  would be chosen for the program as mentors to our at-risk 9th grade students. Throughout the year our 9th  and 11th grade teachers worked extremely hard to spearhead this project at our school. This included  organizing events for mentors and mentees to get to know one another & build relationships. The first event  held this year was a ‘pizza mixer’ where 9th grade students met their potential mentors and then a ‘mega  mixer’ where they spent the day playing games with the ultimate goal of choosing who they would want their  mentor to be. Now, as we move toward the end of the school year this project will begin to focus on the softs  skills that many mentees need such as communication, time management, accountability, and organization.     Next Steps: Looking forward, we have asked our mentors to begin to help us envision what the project should   look like next year. In their Advisory classes, we are asking them to help us co-create an agenda, time-line,  goals and activities for next year so that we start off strong in September and have involvement from all 4  grades—new students for a 9th and 11th grade cohort and then the current students as the 10th and 12th grade  cohort. We have also applied for additional funding per session and project allocation & are awaiting  response.      Girls Empowerment Group:         In response to an increased # of incidents connected to bullying, social media, and relationships we created a  Girls Empowerment Group this year led by my Lead Teacher and a consultant from Sweet River (youth  support). Our young ladies shared their strengths/challenges, future goals, perception/misconceptions, and  an overall desire to be heard and represented in the male-dominated school community. With the overall   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         opportunity to get to know each other outside the academic setting. As the year progressed incidents related  to the social circle of females within the school community dropped dramatically.    RID (Respect Identity Team): The respect identity development team(RID) team provided parent outreach, guidance,  intervention, peer mediation as interventions, check-ins with teachers, counselors, and/or deans as a means of  support before disciplinary measures are taken for students at risk and those with infractions. We changed our name  from Safe and Secure to RID Team. The RID acronym coincides with our vision. The work that we are doing is helping  our students develop their identity and fine-tune their ability to respect themselves, their peers, teachers, school, and  their community.     RID: For students to learn effectively, they must feel safe and comfortable in their learning environment. The   goal of the Respect Identity Development Team is to maintain a learning community that will enhance our  students' to succeed academically, socially, and emotionally.      Respect - Students must understand the importance of respecting themselves, their teachers, their      classmates, and their school. They must understand that each of those components has a direct impact on  their own success as well as the success of others in the school community.  Identity - Students that are in search of their identity lack the focus needed to succeed socially, emotionally  and academically. One of the goals of the RID Team is to help students find their identity and develop  individualized plans that will not only help them become successful students but become outstanding citizens  as adults.     RID - “Rid” of all negative behaviors that impede success.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 19K618   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   403   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     In order to conduct a needs assessment of our current Regents pass rates in Living Environment and US History as  aligned to our Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP) the following strengths and priority needs were addressed:   School’s Strengths      In the 2017-2018 year the school community engaged in our Continuous Improvement Plan (CIP) as aligned to  Math for the 2nd year in a row. This process included strategically tracking students who were mandated to  attend after school and weekend prep classes. The overall 2 year program was successful as our Algebra  Regents passing improved 22% in 2-years showing drastic improvement in scores.    Priority Needs    It is now evidence that the success of our CIP in mathematics must be brought to our Living Environment and United  States history subject areas. The evidence that supports us continuing to implement our CIP in Living environment and  US History classes is our current regents pass rate (Living Environment 56%, US History 60%).            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019 there will be a 5% increase in the Living Environment (June 2018 Pass Rate: 57% to 62%) and US History  Regents pass rate (June 2018 Pass Rate: 60% to 65%) through the implementation of our continuous improvement plan  in both subject areas.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Content teams will meet in August 2018 to review the June 2018  Regents scores as aligned to the students who will be involved in  our continuous improvement plan (CIP).    Teachers involved in the CIP will meet in order to engage in the  New Visions for Public Schools Fish Bowl Protocol in order to  identify the high needs areas to focus on in History and Science  along with some of the reasons why students are not performing  up to standards.       Teachers involved in the CIP process will have a follow up  meeting to discuss students at risk and who should be mandated  to participate in the program. This includes being a part of the  following interventions: pre/mid/post assessments, periodic  assessments, phone call system, MESH, Saturday Prep.    Teachers on the CIP team will strategically identify and generate  a list of students who will participate in both yearlong programs.  Administration will approve these lists with the support of the  Guidance Team. As well, the lists will be shared and discussed at  our Accreditation Committee meeting.

Furthermore, at this time we will assign Peer Tutors to each  student enrolled in the program.    At this juncture the list of all CIP students will be distributed to  the school community and teachers will meet with AIS student to  establish contracts and expectations of the program. Letters will  be backed home informing parents of the program. These letters  will be returned to the teachers in charge. This process will  include follow up with students who do not return letters.    Officially program students enrolled in CIP for after school and  Saturday classes in order for attendance to generate and  teachers to keep track of who is in attendance throughout the  Fall semester. Notify parents when students are not in  attendance.    Ensure that all CIP teachers from both subject areas are meeting  weekly to plan curriculum, discuss progress in regular class and  AIS classes, review periodic assessment data, and plan  accordingly.    Living Environment repeater students will sit for the January  Regents exam and the data will be reviewed. Student who pass  will move on to the next level. Students who have placed out of  CIP will be removed and new students added.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  In order to engage parents and support their understanding of the CIP structures put in place in order to create a  supportive environment at AoIT that encourages student achievement we will send letters home to all parents that  explain the program we have put into place and we ask that parents sign off that they understand their role and  responsibility as a parent as aligned to the CIP. Furthermore, we will periodically check in with parents regarding their  child’s progress on a monthly basis and have at least one CIP parent meeting during term one and term two where  teachers meet with both parents and students to discuss where they are in their AIS program. Lastly, the CIP  structures will be discussed at our SLT and PTSA Meetings. Parents who have students who have not been mandated  to attend can opt in to the program for additional academic support.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.     The resources we will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan include per session aligned  to after school and Saturday classes. Furthermore, we will provide professional development from our Data Specialist  on how CIP teachers can use item analysis tools from New Visions and Skedula to track students’ progress on pre,  mid, and post assessments throughout the semester. All training will be on site and per session will be allocated.  Furthermore, if there is additional curriculum request (Castle Learning) funds will be available to purchase.      Part 4b.

Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  In the month of January 2019 we will analyze our mid year Regents data in order to see our progress toward meeting  this goal. Our overall mid point benchmark will be the January Regents exam to indicate the progress toward meeting  our specified goal along with interim assessments in Living Environment & US History. We will look at the skills & item  analysis documents in order to highlight areas of growth and areas that still need improvement. Curriculum will be  revised accordingly.         Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  The specific measure that is used to assess progress for this goal is the January and June 2019 Regents exams in US  History and Living Environment. As well, we use our internal interim assessment data periodically throughout term  one and monitor it during professional development to meet our goal.      Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20            Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans     Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and  school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     1. This year we had the highest graduation percentage in the history of the school - 79% in June. This speaks to the  supportive environment that we provide our students. As a staff we work together to make sure students stay on  track towards graduation, and apply to college. Through our advisory program (Youth Empowerment Leadership  Development - Y.E.L.P.) we work closely with teachers, our Student Success Center, and counselors to discussion  future plans with students.   2. It very important for our students to be prepared for life outside of high school, and applying and attending the  college that fits their needs most ensures retention in college. Within our College Access for All Survey, 57% of  students "Never" visited a college campus outside of New York City, in addition, our CTE department has forged post- secondary partnerships with 3 local schools, but students have yet to take on this opportunity. Results from our DOE  Snapshot show that only 48% of students enroll in a post-secondary program within 6 months -- so, even if students  apply to college, they are not enrolling. This could be because of finances, preparedness, or they have not applied to a  school that is the best fit for them. We want to change this.   3. Structures we have right now that support our students are: grade teams that meet bi-weekly to engage in  conversations around how to support struggling students, weekly whole staff professional development where we  engage in "kid talk" about students that teachers recommend, our YELP program, the Student Success Center and  College Counselor, and increased PD for teachers to learn about Financial Aid, College Matching. In addition, this year  we developed a peer-mentorship program between the 9th and 11th graders -- that we hope to continue this year as  10th and 12th graders. We received a grant to support our young women and have developed a young women's  leadership group educating our students around restorative justice practices, that we hope next year they will feel  comfortable leading circles with other advisory groups.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in the number (from 48% to 53%) of our students that graduate from our  high school and enroll in college or another post secondary program within 6 months.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

All Teachers   Start- Late   August/Early  September  2018    Administration (Ms.  Lynch, Ms. Stahl,  Ms. Woodham, Lead  PCT/Model  Teachers)   In August 2018 each content team will participate in our annual  Leadership Academy meetings. At these meetings administration  will review CEP goal and ask that Content Team Leaders support  their teachers will finding PD opportunities specifically aligned to  their goals. Administration will share preliminary menu options  based on their internal findings.    Content  Teams    August 2018   Administration (Ms.   Lynch, Ms. Stahl,  Ms. Woodham, Lead  PCT/Model  Teachers)   By October 2018 all EOY conversations will be completed and  every teacher on staff will have identified an area of need and  chosen their specific topic for PD.    By November 2018 each teacher on staff (with the support of  their Lead Teacher, PCT, or assigned Model Teacher) will have  chosen the PD topic they will attend by December 2018.    When we return from winter recess in January 2019 we will  engage in a school wide share fair where teachers will showcase  the PD they attended as aligned to their personal goal.    This process will repeat in Spring 2018 and at our EOY  conversations we will discuss the impact it had on student  achievement and their overall Danielson rating. As well, we will  have a culminating share fair part II during Brooklyn Queens PD  Day.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths (1): This year our entire staff collaborated in order to increase family involvement at the school. We created  a Family Engagement Inquiry Team (consisting of 8 members) that met monthly to plan our staff-wide PD and events  throughout the year. Teachers elected to be part of different teams based on needs of the school: Multicultural  Celebration Team, PTSA Empowerment and Fundraising Team, Demystifying College and Career Team, Family  Meditation Team, and Communication Team.    During Student Led Conferences we have 102 families join us in the fall, and afterwards we surveyed the PTSA and SLT  and took suggestions to improve the Spring SLC -- and we saw improvement in engagement, as we had conferences  with 109 families in the Spring.   Staff members used PD time 1-2 times a month to reach out to families about upcoming events, and progress of  students. Our culminating family event -- our Family Fun Day in May 2018 -- had an increase in family and alumni  attendance (at least 25 family members and alumni attended), and the community raised over $600 to fund the event  (through coffee and bagel sales, and a "A Go Fund Me.")   In addition, we utilized our National Honor Society students and increased their role in outreach to families and new  students. NHS students called incoming 9th graders about our Open House in the Spring, and they were guides during  the Spring SLC -- helping families complete surveys and guiding families to classrooms.    Our SLT team consistently included 2 students each meeting, and half our our SLT meetings included 2 parents as  well. In addition, our PTSA meetings were better attended, advertised more consistently, included food, and special  guests from the staff and community members.       Priority Needs (2): To increase family engagement and family empowerment, we would like to support our PTSA  Executive Board in increasing visibility in the school, and in planning and hosting events of their choosing. The PTSA  has voiced the need for a space to set up within the school, and has voiced the desire to fundraise for a year-end  school trip to 6 Flags. In addition, making sure that the PTSA has a larger group of families in attendance at meetings,  we need to ensure that parents are informed of events, by using multiple modalities, and that we schedule meeting  times and events based on input from our families. Our parent coordinator would like to utilize more ways of  communication with families via Facebook, Twitter, and our website.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

N/A        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

Title I Part A (Basic)   Federal   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Federal   Federal   Federal   Tax Levy (FSF)   Local   $294,373.00      0   $12,366     0    $3,164,436.00      X         X        X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47     which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Academy of Innovative Technology High School, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [Academy of Innovative Technology High School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, reviewing and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the  school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Outside of our ENL direct  instruction program our ELL students have the opportunity to participate in college readiness  programs that include AP Biology, AP US History, & AP English.  Furthermore, ELL students  can participate in internships during their 11th and 12th grade years that will give them the job  readiness skills needed to accelerate in the CTE career path of their choice upon graduation.  Our  ENL teachers encourage ELL students to join these programs as they advance on to their post- secondary educational and career paths.  Part II. MESH Center (Math, English, Science, History)  All of our ELL students, regardless of proficiency or grade level, are required to attend the  MESH Center from October to June two-days a week on Monday & Thursday from 3:07 PM -  5:15 PM to receive academic support.  The total # of sessions for MESH is 48 for the school  year.  The MESH Center is a student driven program that provides academic support and  intervention across the curriculum.  MESH utilizes both peer and teacher tutors to support the  individual academic needs of those who attend.  The MESH Center provides instruction in  English for all subjects; however, there is one ENL Certified Teacher and one to one peer tutors  available for ELL students in their native languages.  Our ENL Teacher in MESH is dual- certified in ENL and also Social Studies.  He works with ENL students who attend MESH  weekly in grades 9-12.  Furthermore, the MESH Center resources include the following:  computer technology, foreign language dictionaries, and translators.

Part IV. Cultural Awareness & Enrichment Program   Our ENL students are also involved in our Title III Cultural Awareness & Enrichment Program  where as a group students take bi-monthly field trips promoting cultural and social awareness as  well as academic learning.  The first event will be a Spanish Heritage Month Celebration that  will take place on October 17, 2018, the second trip/event to NYC/Bryant Park will be held on  December 19, 2018 and there will be 2 more trips in the Spring (March/April) along with a  community service project taking place in May where students will work with the Little Flower  Orphanage.  The cultural awareness program will culminate in May.    ENL Teachers design the excursions and will encourage learning by helping students make  connections, ask questions and experience our ethnically diverse environment.  Museums,  foreign films, ethnic restaurants, and NYC neighborhood walks are a few of the places where  students will be able learn about their community as well as stay connected to one another in  order to maintain a sense of community with in our group.  All trips/events are carefully planned  so that they connect to the topics and units of study being studied within content  classes. Before each trip oral discussions will be held that are in direct alignment to the trip along  with background information on the destination and purpose of trip/event.  After each trip/event  a written assignment will be given requiring that students reflect on their experience and make  connections to the prior class work activities done before the trip.  The teachers will meet with  their groups 2-3 times before the trips to give instruction on the topic of each trip and to  explain/prepare the students for the project.    In preparation for our Spanish Heritage Month celebration students will complete a research  paper on Hispanic leaders and a free choice follow up about a Hispanic hero.  During the  celebration student work will be displayed in the form of poetry, essay writing and art.

These workshops are designed to  inform, teach, and respond to the needs of the English Language Learners (ELLs) at our school.  These sessions are held respectively during the fall, winter, and spring school semesters. The  first PD workshop is intended to familiarize the staff with the years incoming and current ELL  population. During this time the staff takes part in a collaborative data analysis that examines  teacher rosters in relation to ELLs background, school history, NYSELSAT scores, years of  service, and special education needs if applicable.  In addition, we highlight students who have  changed proficiency levels or tested out to ensure that they are still receiving transitional services  and permissible test modifications.  Our hope is that teachers will use this data to drive  instruction, facilitate effective planning, and aid in the staff gaining a holistic knowledge of their  students. The subsequent PD workshops focus on best practices that meet the needs of various  ELL proficiency levels. During these PDs we cover the second language acquisition process,  common difficulties ELLs face, and approaches to teaching that can be utilized in everyday  instruction.   Part II. School Wide Professional Development Plan   School wide professional development takes place each Wednesday from 2:00-3:07 PM for the  entire school year.  Agendas are all kept on file via Google docs and attendance is taken on a  weekly basis.  It is the expectation that 100% of our teaching staff attend school wide  professional development unless out of the building on a personal/sick day & or other  meeting/event.  The topics are ongoing work shops that are connected to literacy, data, measure  of student learning assessments, and outside presentations (turn-keyed by lead teachers).  All.  school-wide professional development will be facilitated by the Assistant Principal, Literacy  Coach, and Lead Teachers from each department.   Part III. Title III External Professional Development Plan  The external professional development plan for Title III Program teachers at our school is  ongoing. We have in house workshops but Title III Program teachers also attend outside PDs  provided by the Division of English Language Learners , Affinity Group, and New  Visions.  These PDs  will directly impact our ENL students by supporting teachers expanding the  types of strategies they can use to improve students reading, writing, speaking, & listening skills  and maintain state mandates for ENL instruction. Teachers will turnkey the information to the  larger staff - specifically focusing on those teachers involved in our Title III program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  For our incoming potential ELLs we use the NYSITELL  and once placed, our students also take the NYSESLAT.  Additionally, we  give in class pre-assessments across the four modalities.  All content areas, including ENL,  have an  assessment  calendar.  From these multiple assessments,  we gather data to design our instructional plan . In addition, we will use an online  reading assessment to track reading level and growth throughout the year, i.e. Pearson's iLitt ELL.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures in place to support this effort are a series of professional development sessions aligned to formative  assessment for teachers.  Based on the professional development provided, teachers are then required to submit a formal  assessment plan, curriculum map, and UBD units articulating how they are using formative assessment practices to support  ENL students and differentiate their curriculum.  In bi-weekly grade team meetings we discuss our ENL students and their  assessment data and progress, and teachers then provide outreach to family members.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use data from the NYSTIELL , NYSESLAT, AMAO,  and other on-going in-house assessments given by our teachers to  evaluate the success of our programs for all of our ENL students.  In addition, we use Regents data to identify progress and  areas of need for upcoming programs and intervention services.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered it is shared with all teachers through professional development.  Content area  teachers are then required to differentiate their curriculum in order to support ENL students with the necessary  scaffolding.  As well, ENL students are then programmed for AIS programs like Saturday School, after-school tutoring center,  and our specialized advisory program for ENL students.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use the 8th grade ELA/Math scores to help us understand the needs of students and what structures we can put in place to  further support students.  We administer the NYSITELL for incoming students new to the NYC DOE and learn from the results  as to which proficiency level class they need to be placed in. We also use the NYSESLAT results to make sure students are  programmed correctly and given the needed AIS supports. In addition, we track classroom grades and progress and provide  professional development for teachers based on need (vocabulary acquisition differentiation, modifying rubrics, getting to  know your students better).     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In weekly ENL content team meetings we discuss adjustments to our program, then in weekly content team meetings (ELA,  History, Science, Math) team members discuss which students need to attend our after school tutoring center and Saturday  School.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our organizational models include self-contained for Entering and Emerging ENL students. With use a variety of co- teaching models to support our ENL students within ELA classes. Our self-contained classes are one period of  ungraded and homogeneously leveled grouped instruction.  All the ENL teachers have common planning meetings in  order to collaborate with the content areas teachers.  During this time teachers discuss how to meet the needs of the  ENL students while staying in alignment with the content curriculum. Different models of team teaching are discussed  in an effort to come up with what best supports our ELL students, especially for our SIFE and SPED students.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.    At this time not applicable.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64          At this time not applicable.     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   According to CR Part 154, students who are at the Entering level receive 540 minutes with an ENL teacher. As for the Emerging  students -- they receive 360  minutes, Transitioning students receive 180 minutes, and Expanding students receive 90  minutes.  These minutes are delivered in a variety of ways: stand alone and co-teaching.             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area classes, which are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, are delivered in English for one period or two  periods differing by grade level and subject.  In order to make content comprehensible for our ELL students ,  content area  teachers use translated glossaries, visuals, a smart board, computers and other differentiated means to make content  comprehensible. Content area teachers also collaborate with the ENL teachers throughout the school year during our weekly  common planning time and during organized in- house professional development in order to plan and implement  differentiated lessons.   Moreover, due to the high influx of Spanish speaking ELLs, many ELL students have access to Spanish  speaking teachers that cultivate their native academic language  by providing verbal translations during classroom  lessons.  Additionally, monolingual teachers of content areas use films with subtitles, audios, and translated texts.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Regents exams, when applicable, are administered to students throughout the year.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     a. Instructionally we provide our SIFE students with extra support through our AIS program (specialized advisory program,  after-school tutoring center, Saturday test prep). Within our specialized advisory program students receive test taking skills,  organizational skills, and social-emotional support to acclimate to high school.       b. Instructionally, we provide newcomers with two 45 minute periods of self- contained ENL classes per day along with extra  support during co-teaching classes.  With these newcomers we focus on building students Basic Interpersonal Communication  skills and fostering students Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. We also encourage them to come to after school and  Saturday regents prep classes for extra help.     c. Instructionally our plan for our Developing students who have been receiving services for 4-6 years are incorporating  thematic units where the students have to produce argumentative essays, interdisciplinary projects, oral presentations and  read a variety of assigned texts.  We also prepare them extensively for the NYSESLAT and Regents exams by carrying out  practice tests and teaching test taking skills.  We use NYSELSLAT data to focus on improving student weaknesses in order to  strengthen these areas.     d. Instructionally we provide long term ELLs with support services. The majority of our long term ELL students are special  education students.  We work in conjunction with the special education coordinator in an attempt to close their academic  gap.  Also, our ELL students who are in ICT classes receive additional support from a Special Education teacher certified in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      content area.  In addition, we use NYSESLAT data to identify which modalities they are struggling with and target those  areas.  Furthermore, we strive to build increased academic vocabulary and give intensive regents and NYSESLAT preparation.  We also provide support for transition to college via the Student Success Center.     e.   As per CR Part 154 our former ELLs receive 90 minutes of  ENL/ELA or other core content area classes. Long term ELLs also  receive testing modifications,  this includes the following mandated testing modifications i.e. extended time, specific sections  read up to three times and glossaries made available. We still provide them with supplemental materials in their native  language as needed. The ENL teachers offer additional support for Regents preparation.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Within our advisory program we offer extra support to ELL-SWD, which is taught by an ENL teacher. Individualized Education  plans are reviewed and teachers cooperatively plan to meet the needs of the students.  This includes modified work within the  classroom as well as projects, assignments, and tests.  Para-professionals/school aides are also designated to specific students  and work closely with them throughout the year.  All ELL-SWDs who receive mandated counseling attend weekly sessions with  grade level guidance counselors and health center therapists if needed.  In order to meet the individual needs of all ELL-SWDs  our school assigns particular students to the appropriate special education teacher, this teacher will be responsible for  providing accommodations and modifications as well as reporting on goals in their IEP.  This includes any speech-language  therapy or occupational therapy mandated on the IEP. As well, our staff works collaboratively in professional learning  communities to ensure the students are receiving the services that they need.  This includes monthly pupil personnel team  meetings which are held to discuss individual student's academic progress, social/emotional needs, and recommended  evaluations given by teachers, staff, and parents.  Lastly, a service grid has been created for Sped teachers to document  where/when students are receiving service and this information can also be located in SESIS.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As stated, we have ICT classes with teachers that are providing additional support  in compliance with the student's IEP.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention services that are offered per each content area and per each sub-group consist of content specific  after school programs at our MESH (MATH, ENGLISH, SCIENCE,  HISTORY) center.  Here there are teachers as well as peer  tutors who help struggling students as needed.    Saturday school is also provided in all subjects.  These programs are  designated for all subgroups, and are focused on Common Core and Regents preparation and honing in on individual  weaknesses.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This coming school year we are seeking to implement Pearson's iLITT ELL online reading program. The program tests students'  reading ability and offers independent reading that is aligned to our student's reading level. In addition, we are re- programming our 9th grade elective class (Project Based Learning), taught by an ENL teacher, to make sure that ELL  receive extra literacy instruction.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         Our ENL students are invited to participate in all aspects of the academic and social life at AoIT. All informational documents  and flyers are translated into the student’s Native language.  We have a variety of sports teams including baseball, volleyball,  soccer, tennis, cricket, bowling, and track and field. Additionally, theatrical arts, academic clubs including the MESH center, are  offered as well.  Our students are given equal access to all after-school academic programs and Saturday regents prep classes.  Students are invited to all school-wide field trips and participate in talent shows, college-visits and fairs, and cultural  celebrations. In addition, new 9th grade ENLs are invited to our Summer Bridge Program in July.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Translated glossaries, dictionaries and to the degree possible text books in their Native language. Additionally, we use  curriculum designed specifically for ENL’s according to their proficiency levels.  Many of our classrooms have access to  SmartBoards, and we have been granted a laptop cart with several computers which we utilize during the self-contained ENL  and PBL classes. Entering and Emerging ENLs receive tablets that can be used in content-area classes that help them translate  and access higher-level academic language.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered as needed in our program through the use of bilingual dictionaries, peer tutoring,  computers, and translated content materials.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required services and support for our ENL students are met through ensuring that, regardless of ages and grade levels the  students receive their mandated minutes based on their proficiency levels, through self-contained and co-teaching classes.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    On our campus we run a campus-wide ENL family night, located in the library -- which is shared space. Schools come together  to inform parents about credit and Regents requirements, state-mandates, proficiency level, the NYSESLAT test dates, and  college.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   During the summer, newly enrolled ELLs’ are invited to join our Summer Bridge program.  This is a high school introductory  program where students receive academic instruction in ELA and Math.  The students also go on trips and become acclimated  with the school environment.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently, Spanish and French are the electives offered to all of students, including our English Language Learners.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not currently have a Dual Language Program.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1.  The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at our school is ongoing. We have in house workshops and also  attend outside PDs provided by the Division of English Language Learners, and New Visions.  The information is then turn  keyed by one or more of the ENL teachers to our staff. We visited Showcase Schools across the city, and as two of our ENL  teachers are NYC DOE Teacher Leaders, we receive training in how to facilitate teacher teams and turnkey strategies.   2.  The ENL department engaged in a Problem of Practice around improving reading comprehension and writing skills, at the  end of the year we led a whole-staff PD around our findings and presenting student work and modeling vocabulary  development strategies that help ENL students. In addition, the ENL department monthly "Lunch and Learns" that addressed  the needs of teachers when it came to supporting their ENL students. The ENL department also led a whole-staff PD around  "getting to know" our ENL students better using data from the EDAT.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  We track our whole staff ENL PDs via agenda and calendar dates, teachers who recieve outside PD that supports our ENL  students keep track of their own CTLE hours.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   This year our ENL team attended a PTSA meeting to welcome new parents and encourage parental involvement. At our  PTSA meetings we have our parent coordinator there that is able to translate for Spanish speakers. In addition, teachers reach  out to parents throughout the year to have one-on-one meetings as needed.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   At our school we have PTSA (Parent Teacher Student Association) which organizes various events and gatherings in which all  parents are invited.  Phone calls and invites by mail are sent home to ENL parents. In September we offer a Fall  Curriculum Night, we host a mid-year whole campus ENL family night, and in the Spring we have the Family Fun day.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meghan Lynch, Principal , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Academy of Innovative Technolo                                                                              School DBN: 19K618  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodolgies used to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs to ensure  that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand are as  follows:   1. Each year the Parent Coordinator analyzes the data obtained through our ATS reports regarding the home  language of all students at AoIT. Based on this data we assess the needs of our students in order to obtain the  proper written and oral interpretation resources. If applicable we will use on site support service. However, we  will out source to DOE approved vendors if need be.    2. Each year the ENL Department administers the Home Language Survey to all new incoming students to obtain  the necessary information regarding their home language. This data is passed on to both our School Support Staff   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      and Administrative Team. Based on the needs of our new students we determine what resources we may need in  correlation with written translation and oral interpretation services.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    The major findings of our  school's written translation  and oral interpretation  needs for the 2015-2016  school year are as follows:   1. Spanish written  translation and oral  interpretation services are  in the highest demand as a  majority of our students'  home language is Spanish.  Therefore, we report this to  the school community  through our Parent  Coordinator and Spanish  Teacher who consistently  reach out to all staff  members regarding  supporting them with  written translation and oral  interpretation. This  communication comes in  the form of email and  written updates to  teachers/staff members on  a weekly basis.   2. This current school year  there was an increase in  Parents who speak Spanish  as their Native Language.  Therefore, additional  written translation and oral  interpretation will be  needed for the Fall & Spring  Parent/Teacher Conferences  and additional support for  teachers when calling  Parents and sending home  letters in the mail.

Overall, most written  translation and oral  interpretation can be done  in house or throughout the  Franklin K. Lane Educational  Campus where we share  translation services with the  four schools on our Campus  (Brooklyn Lab, Cypress Hills,  Multi Cultural High School).  Furthermore, Multi Cultural  High School provides in  house Chinese, Bangali, and  Japanese translation  services that can be easily  accessed when needed and  are used periodically  throughout the school year  to support our  Chinese/Japanese student  population. For translations  other than Spanish like Urdu  or Punjabi, we reach out to  the translation services.

As well, outreach to  other schools on Campus for Bengali translations will support us with reaching out to that small population of  students. Furthermore, for the upcoming school year we are researching a text message system that will allow us to  text all parents in their native language in the event of a school emergency.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Our school will ensure that all staff members are aware of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 and the resources that are  available to meet compliance through staff professional development at the start of the year. This includes reviewing  the regulations and also understanding the needs to all ELL students in our school community.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In order to meet the parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services each year the  Parent Coordinator notifies Parents with regards to the schools and offices responsibility for assisting with services  and provides parents with a copy of the Bill of Parents Rights and Responsibilities as aligned to the required  translation and interpretation services provided. As well, the Parent Coordinator obtains all data regarding what  languages translation and interpretations services are needed in to ensure that all documents are prepared according  to the Parents' needs each year.    In addition, the main office will post the available language services for Parents along with information regarding  languages that will be translated and interpreted using the NYC DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit. In the event  a Parent needs immediate assistance and does not speak one of the languages available for translation we will contact  one of the other schools on our Campus within our network of translation and interpretation on the FKL Campus.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In order to gather feedback from Parents ENL teachers invite parents to all cultural celebrations, PTSA, Fun Run, and  the end of the year pot luck celebration. Additionally, at Welcome Back night we ask parents to come in and meet the  ENL department and here the staff informally gathers information on the home language. The Parent Coordinator  meets with Parents each month at our PTSA meeting and will present Parents with a brief survey in December and  then again in May to gather feedback. As well, the ENL Team/Department will meet with Parents during Curriculum  Night and Student Led Conferences (November/March) again familiarizing themselves with the needs of families. At  this time the ENL Department will have Parents complete a brief survey regarding the quality of the translation and  interpretation services given to parents at AoIT.    Once information is obtained from the first Parent survey we will meet as a Translation and Interpretation Team to  review the information obtained in order to make strategic improvements to the quality of our translation and  interpretation services provided to Parents. The team will meet again in May once the final survey data is obtained to  discuss improvements to our services for the upcoming school year.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77
