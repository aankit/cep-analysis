This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our School Mission is to work collaboratively in our school community, towards achieving high levels of academic  success. It is our goal to prepare students for the global society that awaits them. Our school is committed to creating  an atmosphere which enables all students to respect and appreciate diversity. We foster an environment that  nurtures and challenges the development of civic and social responsibilities, while tapping into our students’ artistic  abilities, creating a community of productive, life-long learners. We continue to cultivate the social and emotional  well being of our students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      In this safe, nurturing environment, we cultivate a community of productive life-long learners who are flexible and  adaptable and who will become active participants in our school and the future global community.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Anne Sullivan School, P.S.238, is a barrier-free Title 1 school. We are a diverse, multi-cultural school instructing  students from grades Pre-K through 8. Our elementary school (grades Pre-K - 4) has 18 classes inclusive of 4 dual  language (DL) co-teaching classes, 1 English as a New Language (ENL) class, two integrated co-teaching classes (ICT),  and two 12:1:1 classes. Our middle school (grades 5 - 8) is fully departmentalized and is comprised of 11 classes which  includes three 12:1:1 classes and one integrated co-teaching class. Additionally, we offer an Accelerated 7th and 8th  grade class allowing our accelerated students to be on track for taking the Common Core Math and Living  Environment Regents in 8th grade. The elementary and intermediate divisions are serviced by three assistant  principals and two deans. Our 2 guidance counselors serve as intervention specialists and middle/ high school liaisons.  Our PIP and SAT Teams oversee academic intervention services and provide Social-Emotional support for all students.    We are proud to be the recipient of the 2018 "Respect for All" Award as well as receiving the honor of being awarded  a "Just Say Hi Collaborative School Award" for our collaborative work with 75K231.   We are entering our second year working collaboratively with the Brooklyn Arts Council to support our ENL and  students with disabilities (SWD), This cooperative work has enabled us to be awarded a grant where we have offered  these students exposure to acting, improvisation, and developing oral skills.. This program has been incorporated into  many of our social studies classes.   Our partnership with Community Counseling and Mediation (CCM) continues for the 4th year, This after-school  program is for students in grades 6 - 8 and has helped in the Social-Emotional growth of our students as well as giving  them the opportunity to develop strong leadership skills. Many of our graduating 8th grade students are now  interning with CCM. We are especially proud of this collaboration as it helps to support our effort to prepare our  students for college and career. This is further evidenced as many of our graduating 8th grade students return to  intern with CCM allowing them to demonstrate the leadership skills they learned while students in our school. This  also, enables them to continue to be a part of our 238 family. CCM further supports the academic needs of our  students with an after-school AIS program as well incorporating a 7th grade STEM program made possible as part of a  grant through Designed to Learn.    STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) is also an integral part of our school day as well. A grant from Slow  Food NYC has made STEM accessible to our lower grades as they have planted and maintained an outdoor vegetable  and flower garden. Visiting chefs present and cook with our students. Our third grade teachers and students have set  up and maintained a complex Hydroponics Lab as part of this program. Several classes experimented with the  engineering design process of creating and designing stable structures, wind power and coding. These sessions were  facilitated by our STEM certified ENL and Technology teachers. This further helped our ENL students develop content  specific language.   With our ENL (English New Language) population at 38%, we strive work collaboratively in order to implement  programming that will best suit the needs of our students and their families. In 2017-2018, we had 3 Dual Language  classes in grades K - 2. Students in these classes received instruction in two languages and the goal was for them to to  be able to read, write and speak fluently in both. Moving into 2018-2019 we are expanding the program to grade 3 as  well. In addition to that, an ENL class is being added to first grade. Rosetta Stone is available to offer assistance in  language acquisition for our new ENL students. A partnership with Marquis Studio has given the opportunity to our  ENL students to be part of an enrichment after-school program which has offered them classes in: radio theatre,  shadow puppetry, and photography.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our Middle school math teachers have joined with the district-wide inquiry method of Continuous Learning -  Improvement Foundation. Through this inquiry process these teachers will test and incorporate standards based  strategies that will provide opportunities for our new ENL students to achieve success and proficiency in mathematics.   To maintain the high quality of our curriculum, we made changes during the 2017-2018 school year, with more  changes moving into the 2018-2019 school year. We are pleased to continue, for the second year, with McGraw Hill's  "Math: Built to the Common Core". This rigorous, standards based program is for our students in grades 6 - 8.  Additionally, we will continue with Go Math for our students in grades K -5, but have also incorporated Generation  Ready. Part of a district initiative, Generation Ready is a conceptually based math learning experience incorporating  the Next Generation Math Standards. We have also added the customized learned services from Generation Ready  allowing for our teachers and students to be better prepared to meet life's challenges. Our pre-K students have had  success with the conceptually based Building Blocks for mathematics. For the 2018-2019 school year, Building Blocks  will be incorporated into the Kindergarten curriculum as well. Additional support is available through several  standards based on-line math resources: IXL Math, iReady Math and ALEKS. These resources offer students the ability  to practice their grade level skills, revisit topics they struggle with or move forward into advanced grade level  standards.   Through a grant, we have formed a partnership with the Writing Revolution which will train administrators and  teachers (grades 3 - 8) on the explicit modeling of writing strategies to be incorporated into all content areas. This  method drives the rigor of all writing activities, enabling students to progress in reading, speaking, listening as well as  writing. The Six Principles of the Hochman Writing Method stresses that students need explicit instruction and that  sentences are the building blocks of writing. Furthermore when writing is incorporated into all content areas it  becomes a powerful teaching tool. Labs will be set up in selected classrooms allowing teachers to model strategies  and observe others as these practices are put into action. This professional learning community will offer teachers the  opportunity to provide and receive feedback.   Passport, a Social Studies program, has been brought into the school across the grades. Furthermore, we have  enlisted the services of a Social Studies consultant to make complex social issues more neutral, allowing for access  and equity for all. Students are further challenged in Social Studies and ELA using Think Cerca.   As part of a district wide initiative, we empowered our students to embark on critical learning in the content area with  a focus on social issues. This research based project, as part of the Learning Centered Initiative (LCI,) enabled our  middle school students to become involved in action research resulting in authentic projects across the content areas  of ELA, Social Studies, Science and Art. Moving into the 2018-2019 school year, it will be expanded to also include  Mathematics.   Seventh and 8th grade students will be a part of a city-wide initiative as we join with College Access for All offering  these students and their parents the opportunity to research, learn and prepare for college. Lesson modules for  students and parents will be incorporated to help in this roll-out. College visits have been planned throughout the  school year to allow students and their parents to have a more hands on experience.    We are pleased to have partnered with the New York Junior Tennis League (NYJTL). Through this partnership, our 7th  grade students will receive tennis instruction with a focus on developing strong character traits such as resilience,  perseverance and sportsmanship. Students will also be involved in the Arthur Ashe and NYJTL Writing Contests  allowing them to develop the art of writing a college essay.   In preparing our students for the global society that awaits, we continually expand and update our technology  department. Our computer lab is furnished with 30 desktop computers, printers, scanner and Interactive Promethean  Board. Most students in grades 2 - 8 are regularly scheduled for computer class with a full-time computer teacher. In  addition to that, our library is set up with Promethean Board, 10 desktop computers as well as both a black and white  and color printer. Every classroom has either an Interactive Promethean or Smart Board. Color printers are accessible  for each grade and nearly every classroom has 2-4 desktop computers and a printer. Computer or iPad carts are  available at every grade level allowing access to every class. As we move into the 2018-2019 school year our female   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      students in grades 6 - 8 will be involved in "Citi Women in Technology" program. This initiative helps to support our  students so they may be college and career ready.    Professional development opportunities are provided across the disciplines, enabling our teachers to expand and  grow in their instructional practices while strategically targeting to student achievement. Our 3 O' Clock Swap has  enabled our teachers to take ownership of their professional development and share the skills and strategies that  they have found success with. It also allows teachers to turn-key the practices that they have learned at workshops.    P.S. 238 is proud to welcome our parents into our community of learners. Strong family and community ties are  essential to achieving our mission. We engage in a collaborative process with parents to identify and support their  children’s needs to develop strategies and activities to foster family engagement. We are very proud of the  workshops that are offered to parents. Our workshops are meant to inform, instruct and support. In order to tailor  the workshops to meet specific needs, parents are surveyed at the beginning of the school year to ascertain what  they want and/or need. Based on the surveys we have offered workshops such as: Building Self-Esteem, Writing  Resumes and Anti-Bullying. These and other workshops will continue into the 2018-2019 school year and will be  facilitated by our Guidance Staff, teachers, administrators as well as outside DOE specialists. Our ENL parents receive  extra support with our early morning parent workshop offering them the support and resources as they learn a new  language.    Home/school communication continues with our Internet based grading program, io Education/Pupil Path. This  program enables parents in K-8 to monitor their children's progress in their academic classes and to communicate  with the teachers.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Of the 543 students in our school registered in grades k - 8, 214 (39.4%) are students identified as ENL students with  about 40% of the ENL students in grades 1 - 8 enrolled less than two years. These students, as well as their parents,  need additional assistance in acclimating to the new environment, new school and a new language. Many of them  need support and scaffolds to achieve academic success. Strategic planning and programming allows us to  incorporate programs that assist these families.   Our Students with Disabilities (SWD) account for 21.6% of our student population. They need academic support  achieved through educational scaffolds and reduced class settings. We strive to accomplish that with 4 reduced sized  classes (12:1:1) as well as 2 ICT classes. Students in temporary housing are in need of social and emotional support in  addition to their other needs.    Our gifted and talented students need further enrichment and challenges in and outside of the classroom setting.  These students are programmed for regents classes and talent. Many of them are student ambassadors and serve as  student council leaders.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   For the 2017-2018 school year our instructional focuses were developed based on the analysis of school wide data  and were represented in our annual goals. We are especially pleased with the progress that we made in with these  goals.    With a focus on Rigorous Instruction, we continued with our school-wide initiative in mathematics whereas students  were all problem solving and breaking down math word problems while talking the 'same language'. Our work with  Generation Ready has enabled students in grades k - 4 to build on their math knowledge and approach problems  conceptually. Our Middle School students embarked on a more rigorous math program from McGraw Hill. We  expanded our math program to include an additional two periods and found success with the adaptive math program  ALEKS administered during those periods.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Our Supportive Environment Focus was to create a supportive and challenging environment for our middle school  students. Through more challenging questioning in our Social Studies classes, we successfully moved students (grades  6 and 8) in their ability to "evaluate claims and evidence". Students were exposed to artifact explorations allowing  them to make many of the connections needed to achieve these goals. We furthered this effort by relating historical  knowledge with a broader societal connection. Students delved into the effects of historical events on society overall.  This plan of action started in the 2016 -2017 school year and was expanded on in 2017-2018 year to incorporate  grades 4 and 5 as well. The talents of our Social Studies teachers along with those of our Science, ELA, and Art  teachers helped to create a cohesive Social Studies program that enabled our students to see a broader social  connection enabling them to move even further in the traits of evaluating claims and evidence. Additional support  from our partnership with Brooklyn Connection (Brooklyn Public Library) further assisted our 6th grade students as  they used technology and access to archived information at the Grand Army Plaza Research Lab to complete their  research project about Coney Island.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K238   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   611   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

A total of (331) students took the 2018 NYS Math Exam in grades 3 – 8. Data indicated that 26% (85) of our students in  grades 3 - 8 were proficient scoring a level 3 or above. This is an increase of 4 percentage points from the 2017 state  exam.   Beginning of year I-Ready Diagnostics revealed that out of 334 students assessed in grades 3 - 8, 51% (171) are  identified as being On, Above or Emerging as indicated by the "Beginning of Year" view.   The New York City Performance Assessment (NYCPT) in math was administered to students in grades K - 2. Students  scored an overall average of 24.8% of the possible points. Incorporating strategies from Generation Ready Math into  Kindergarten last year has shown to have a level of success, as our incoming first grade students performed higher  than our school average with these 1st grade students averaging 41.2% of of the possible points. Furthermore, they  scored higher than the district's first graders with 42.7% (32) of the students in the 50-100% range as opposed to the  district's results of 26.2% of the students at this same level.    The 2015-16 Quality Review indicated a Proficient rating for Indicator 2.2 (Rigorous Instruction/Curricula-aligned  assessment practices). This resulted in a 3.5 score on the N.Y.C.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The 2018 NYC School Survey indicates that 95% of families feel that they are well-informed in a language they can  understand. Furthermore, 91% feel that school staff regularly communicates with them about how they can help their  child. Parents also feel that teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs. However, only 57% of middle  school students feel that it is important to be a school everyday.    End of year school attendance data revealed that our average school-wide attendance was 92.5% which is below the  district k-8 school average of 93.1%. School-wide analysis showed that 395 out of 617 students (64%) have an  attendance average of greater than 92.5%. Sixty-one of these students (27.5%) have more than 5 late days for the  school year.   Beginning of year data shows that of the 527 students in grades k - 8, 68.9% (363) have been present less than 92% of  the school days.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school.

The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [P.S. 238 , The Anne Sullivan School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Marquis Studios works with schools  through arts residencies in the areas of dance, music, theater, STEM and visual arts.  These  residencies are customized to the appropriate age and skill level of the students involved.  All  programs integrate the arts with instruction in academic subjects according to the Next  Generation Standards and the New York City Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts.      We will be initiating four different residencies in an after-school program that will span ten  weeks.  The first two will take place from October through December and the other two will  begin in January and culminate in March.  Each session will be 90 minutes.  A licensed ENL  teacher will partner with teaching artists from Marquis Studios for each residency.  Please note  that although one school-based ENL teacher is being paid per session, through Title III funds, the  four after-school residencies, along with the partnering teaching artists will be purchased through  Title III funds in order to provide direct instruction to our ELLs.  The language of instruction for  all residencies will be English.    Our first residency, which will take place on Wednesdays from 2:25 to 3:55 from October  through December, is Bookmaking.  ELLs in grades one and two will be invited to participate in  this exciting learning opportunity.  This residency has the power to motivate even the most  reluctant readers and writers.  It focuses on the physical creation of a simple book, such as an  accordian or pop-up book as well as the unique content inside it.  Students will explore various  paper-folding techniques that make their images and texts come alive.  This program promotes  freedom of expression and creativity.  During the tenth and final week of the program, parents  will be invited to a showcase where the students will perform and demonstrate their newly  acquired skills.    Our second residency, which will take place on Thursdays from 2:25 to 3:55 from October  through December, is Mask Making.  ELLs in grades three and four will be invited to take part in  this residency.  In this program, ELLs will create their own masks, which can depict human,  animal or fantasy faces.  Masks play an important feature in pageants, plays, ceremonies, rituals  and festivals all over the world.  Students will craft masks with a variety of materials such as  paper, paper mache, plaster, masking tape and foil to create wearable three-dimensional  works.  Students will examine the roles of features, expression and exaggertion as well as color,  value and pattern.   During the tenth and final week of the program, parents will be invited to a  showcase where the students will share and display their newly acquired skills.    Our third residency, which will take place on Wednesdays from 2:25 to 3:55, from January  through March is Printmaking.  ELLs in grades five and six will be invited to take part in this  residency.  In this program, students will explore the exciting world of printmaking, an art form  where an original plate is created and duplicated into various prints.  They will discover the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   differences and similarities between styrofoam prints, linocuts, screen prints, monoprints and  mixed media prints.  Brayers are used to roll ink onto their design before being transferred to  paper.  The process stresses the importance of experimentation and trial and error to achieve their  various creations.  During the tenth and final week of the program, parents will be invited to a  showcase where the students will display and demonstrate their newly acquired skills.    Our fourth residency, which will take place on Thursdays from 2:25 to 3:55, from January  through March is Self-Portraiture.  ELLs in grades seven and eight will be invited to take part in  this residency.  In this program, students will create self-portraits and begin a a journey of self- discovery.  Using a variety of media such as drawing, painting and collage, students will explore  the different ways of showing facial features, expression and emotion.  A portrait visually  communicates distinct individual qualities.  Students will be inspired by the self-portraits of  famous artists to see how they chose to portray themselves and their interests.  The teaching  artist will collaborate with the ELL teacher to have each student write an artist statement about  who they are and what their portrait tells the viewer about them.  Home language support will be provided to  ELLs through the use of language buddies, where  available.  In addition, ELL students have been provided with bilingual glossaries to use  throughout the school day.  They will be instructed to bring these learning tools with them to the  after school program, as well.      Student attendance and program notification in parents' preferred languages will be maintained  by the teacher working the program.

There will be one  training and planning session that will take place on a Monday afternoon during designated PD  time for school staff.     All school-based staff will receive three ELL-focus professional development sessions, provided  by our ENL teacher team.  These sessions will be held on Monday afternoons and will focus on  ELL identification, assessment, placement, programming, and effective strategies for teaching,  differentiation and scaffolding for English Language Learners in the classroom.

This initiative was a  result of a needs assessment that was conducted by our parent cordinator and staff  developer.  Parents will be notified at other parent meetings and events, as well as through an  invitation sent home with students.  Additionally, the program will be advertised on our school's  exterior billboard and on various signage throughout the school building.  These classes will  meet twice per week for one hour, from October through June.  The class will be taught by a  bilingual social worker, as well as a school secretary.  This program will take place during the  school day and is at no cost to Title III funds.  A portion of the Title III parent funds will be used  to purchase 15 Rosetta Stone licenses for use with our newcomer parents during the ENL class.   At the conclusion of the Marquis Studios after-school program, described in Part B, parents will  be invited to a culminating student presentation, highlighting the work completed during the  program. This event will take place on the last day of the after school programs in December and  March, respectively.  An additional Parental Engagement activity will be held in February, informing parents of all  ELLs in grades K through eight about the NYSESLAT exam, administered in the spring.  The  session will address the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing, assessed on  this examination.  ENL teachers will make recommendations for the strategies which parents can  address at home with their children to ensure their academic success.   Notices will be sent home (backpacked) in order to notify parents about all of the  aforementioned activities.  Please note that there will be translators available at all of the  aforementioned Parent Engagement Activities. In addition, the aforementioned Parent  Engagement sessions, with the exception of the purchase of the parent licenses for Rosetta Stone,  will be at no cost to Title III funds.   Agendas, attendance sheets and invitations, in parents preferred languages, will be maintained in  the ELL Department's compliance file.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) assessment to determine the early literacy skills of all students, including ELLs. This data  will assist teachers in implementing appropriate instructional plans for their students, allowing them to differentiate and  target specific areas of literacy deficiencies, as well as other related areas.  This assessment data drives guided reading groups,  as well as RTI (Response to Intervention) groups, enabling teachers to hone in, more specifically on students’ individual needs.     In addition, students in the early childhood grades are administered the New York City Performance Tasks (NYCPT) in ELA, two  times per year.  This data, although used for teacher-evaluation MoSL (Measures of Student Learning) purposes, allows  teachers to have further literacy data on their students, further enabling them to target areas of deficiency during the school  year.  At this time, the beginning of year MoSL assessments are being administered to our students, and the current data is not  yet available.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   F&P data will assist teachers in implementing appropriate instructional plans for their students, allowing them to differentiate  and target specific areas of literacy deficiencies, as well as other related areas.  This assessment data drives guided reading  groups, as well as RTI (Response to Intervention) groups, enabling teachers to hone in, more specifically on students’ individual  needs.      In addition, NYCPT data, although used for teacher-evaluation MoSL (Measures of Student Learning) purposes, allows teachers  to have further literacy data on their students, further enabling them to target areas of deficiency during the school year.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use the NYC Performance Tasks in ELA for grades K-2 and in Social Studies for grades 6-8, as well as the ELL Periodic  Assessment to identify baseline progress and areas of need.  These assessments are administered three times per school year  in order to monitor student progress.  We will also be utilizing iReady in ELA  for grades 2-8 and in math for grades 2-4, as well,  to determine areas of need for all students, including those of our ELL population.  These assessments are given three times  over the course of the school year.  Finally, the math department in grades 5-8 will be using the ALEKS math assessment for  both diagnostic and instructional purposes.  This assessment will be given on an ongoing basis.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, teacher teams will meet to identify trends revealed by the data.  In addition,  they will plan targeted instruction in order to target areas of need.  Inquiry teams, grade teams and ELL teaching staff will  collaborate to address interventions.  In the middle school, we have a STEP program, which provides individualized math  instruction to students, including ELLs in grades 5-8.  The ongoing ALEKS diagnostic and instructional assessments will assist in  adjusting groups and honing in on areas of deficiency     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses multiple data sources to inform RTI instruction, allowing us to group students according to their instructional  needs and levels.  The data sources include, but are not limited to Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, iReady assessment  results, Core Knowledge and Go Math assessment data, classroom assessment data, as well as student performance on state  exams and NYC Performance Assessments.  Our RTI program enables us to determine whether students are benefiting from an  instructional program within a reasonable time and build more effective instructional programs for students who are not  benefiting.  In addition, we continually monitor student data throughout the school year to determine if RTI instruction needs  to be adjusted or modified, allowing us to compare the efficiency of different forms of instruction and design more effective,  individualized instructional programs for the purpose of increasing educational opportunities for ELL students.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We utilize the results from the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and the NYS Math exam in order to evaluate and inform our ELL  programs.  In 2016, 0 ELLs scored at or above grade level on the NYS Math Exam, while 1% scored at or above proficiency on  the NYS ELA Exam.  This increased slightly in 2017, with 5% of our ELLs meeting proficiency on the ELA and 9% meeting  proficiency on the Math Exam.      The current NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data reveals that 36% of our total ELL population is at the Expanding proficiency level,  with a significantly high concentration in grades six through eight.  An additional 17% of our ELLs are at the Entering level, and  21% are at the Emerging level, with another 26% at the Transitioning level.       The following chart shows the current percentage of students at each proficiency level, sorted by grade level.

What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ELL Department meets regularly with the assistant principal who heads the department.  This team looks at data trends  and determines areas to target.  Their finding are disseminated to the staff through grade conferences, inquiry meeting and in- house staff development sessions.  Through collaboration, the  instructional staff plan instruction and make adjustments to  programs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In our Freestanding English as a New Language program, students are grouped heterogeneously by grade.  For the  integrated ENL component of the program, a licensed ENL teacher co-teaches with a licensed common-branch or  content area teacher.  For the standalone ENL component, a licensed ENL teacher groups the ELL students at the  entering and emerging levels of proficiency by grade for grades kindergarten through two.  For grades three through  eight, the standalone ENL groups consists of students in two contiguous grades.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      In our Dual Language program, all ELL students are grouped together heterogeneously in one kindergarten, one first  grade and once second grade class.  Each class is taught by two teachers: one with a bilingual extension and one with  a common branch and/or a special education license.  The subject areas of ELA and science are delivered in  English.  There is Spanish Native Language Arts instruction delivered every day.  In addition, the subjects of math and  social studies are taught in both English and Spanish.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Once the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results have been analyzed, at the beginning of the school year, ELL student proficiency  levels determine the instructional minutes they will receive.  As per CR Part 154.5, students at the entering and emerging  levels receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in the content area of ELA, and an additional 180 minutes of standalone  ENL.  Students at the transitioning and expanding level receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in the content area of  ELA.  Students at the commanding level, considered former ELLs,  receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in the content areas of  ELA, math or science.  Please note that all students, regardless of ELL status, receive 360 minutes of ELA instruction per week.       In the dual language program, half of all instruction is delivered in English and the other half is given in Spanish, through Home  Language Arts instruction.  All students in this program receive 360 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   During the integrated ENL model, content area instruction is scaffolded through the use of leveled texts, sentence  deconstruction, vocabulary ladders, illustrations, classroom computers, SmartBoards, as well as authentic hands-on materials  and manipulatives.  Content is taught through collaborative team teaching and small guided, differentiated groups.  Academic  language development is fostered through differentiated activities, individualized to meet the specific needs of all  students.  During freestanding ENL instruction, teachers focus on building academic language and Tier II vocabulary, as well as  ELA skills and test-taking strategies, aligned to the NYS  Learning Standards.  Teachers use data from classroom assessments,  performance assessments and State Exams, in order to target specific areas of deficiency and meet the needs of individual  students.     In our dual language program, math and social studies content is delivered in both English and Spanish.  There is a home  language arts component to the program, as well as integrated ENL/ELA instruciton.  Language is taught and fostered through  content areas as  well as through literacy.       Teachers in the ENL and Dual Language Program utlize the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) and the Home Language  Arts Progressions in order to scaffold instruction for our ELLs in order for them to meet the rigorous demands of the of the  NYS Learning Standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All newly enrolled ELLs, who speak Spanish, are administered the Spanish LAB during the same testing window as the  NYSITELL.  This is done to determine the language dominance of these ELLs.  Additionally, ELLs in the dual language program  are assessed throughout the school year in order to monitor their progress in the development of their home language skills.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.)  Our instructional plan for SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) students includes building a supportive  environment that responds to the immediate social, cultural and linguistic needs of the students.  Bilingual staff members, in  addition to ENL teachers, support the students.  SIFE students are partnered with peers or classmates who can support and  further integrate them into their grade and school community. In order to help them accelerate and catch up to their peers,  they are grouped with newcomer students during ENL instruction, and provided with remedial instruction, wherever  necessary.  The NYS curriculum   is adapted so that students learn critical material in a way that is effective, accessible and age-appropriate.  Students are  provided with intensive literacy and language instruction which stresses the five components of reading; phonemic  awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.  This increases student access to literacy-rich environments and  print materials, increasing language development and proficiency.  When deemed beneficial, these students are granted  access to Rosetta Stone Language Learning technology.  Please note that we do not currently have any SIFE students.      b.)  Newcomers who have been enrolled in our school for zero to three years comprise 79% of our total ELL population.  It  is therefore necessary to implement a rigorous academic ENL program, ensuring that students develop both BICS (Basic  Interpersonal Communication Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) in an accelerated manner.  For those  students who have less than one year of English language instruction, language is introduced through the use of pictures,  illustrations, visual clues, graphic organizers and TPR (Total Physical Response).  Language development is encouraged through  the use of music, recorded books, and art projects.  Listening stations are utilized so that students may listen and read  concurrently.  Every effort is made to   bring the students’ home language and culture into the classroom, by using various materials in their native languages,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      including bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, translated student articles, native-language books.  As students progress beyond  their first year of English acquisition, instruction is scaffolded and individually tailored to equip students to meet the academic  rigor and challenges facing them in their classrooms, on high stakes exams, and in life.  Using reading strategies to increase  student comprehension is a major instructional component to ensure language development and acquisition.  Other teaching  strategies include; the use of pictures, role play, dramatization, manipulatives, questioning techniques, Big Books, read aloud,  shared and guided reading, as well as small group instruction.  A key instructional technique is the establishing of routines and  rituals   through repetition, in order to promote effective thinking and learning amongst our students.  Our reading and writing  instruction is highly rigorous, utilizing academic language and multiple alternate texts to supplement vocabulary and literacy  instruction.  This ensures that ELLs, who may not understand the academics through the use of regular texts, grasp the content  and meaning from the various alternate texts and authentic materials infused by ENL teachers into instruction.     Language development includes listening, speaking, reading, and writing in cognitively demanding lessons that are scaffolded  to increase student learning of both language skills and content. The content area is derived from the grade-level expectations  and curriculum in the mainstream classroom. Lessons are focused on the essential ideas taught in depth using higher- order  thinking skills.  A critical component of the lesson is strategy instruction. Metacognitive strategies are selected for their use in  learning specific lesson content as well as their transferability to other concepts. Students are explicitly told the name of the  strategy, why using it will assist their learning, and how to use it within the lesson context and across other curriculum  areas.  Additionally, all Entering and Emerging-level ELLs in grades two through eight will be working with the Rosetta Stone  language learning software, which is scientifically proven to accelerate language development in the four modalities of  listening, speaking, reading and writing.       c.) ELLs who have received four to six years of English language instruction comprise 16% of our total ELL population. For  these students, the academic instruction builds upon the solid foundation laid in previous years of English language  development.  We focus on further developing students’ cognitive academic language and vocabulary development.  Tier II  and III vocabulary is infused throughout proficiency levels in all grades and content areas.  The use of alternate texts, the  formation of word ladders, word chains, and vigorous vocabulary activities enhances students’ academic language acquisition  and proficiency.  Academia is highly promoted through hands-on activities and the use of manipulatives.  To that end, realia,  texts, vivid illustrations and visuals promote critical thinking and inferencing, which ultimately motivates students to ask skilled  questions, promoting further academia. It should be noted that 22 out of the 33 student in this category are students with  disabilities. The ENL teachers work with the classroom teachers for these students to ensure that specific learning needs and  IEP goals are addressed during instruction.       d.) The aforementioned instructional approaches, in conjunction with additional language supports, are utilized with our Long- Term ELLs.  While our Long-Term ELL population makes up only 5% of our total ELL population, these students receive more  personalized attention and differentiated instruction in an effort to help them attain English language proficiency.  It should be  noted that six out of the seven students in this category are students with disabilities.  It is therefore necessary that the ENL  teacher work with the classroom teacher in order to meet the unique learning needs and goals of these students.  These  students are given more time on task and are provided with instruction that has a strong foundation in literacy, writing and  academic vocabulary development.      e.)  ELLs who attain proficiency on the NYSESLAT exam continue to receive support, for 90 minutes per week, in the content  areas, during integrated ENL instruction .  Continuing transitional support focuses on maintaining and enhancing students’  academic language and overall proficiency.  Classroom teachers give those former ELLs extra attention and provide  differentiated materials and activities to meet their diverse needs.  This support is given to former ELLs for two years after  attaining proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  In addition, former ELLs continue to receive testing accommodations on exams for two  years after attaining proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  We currently have 25 Former-ELLs in grades one through eight.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      The ELL department works in close collaboration with the special education teachers to design effective educational plans  tailored to meet the specific needs of ELLs in special education.  The IEP (Individualized Education Program) goals, as well as  specific language needs, are targeted when planning instruction for these ELLs.  Students whose IEPs mandate bilingual  instruction are placed in any available bilingual program that our school may have.  In the event that a specific language or  grade-level bilingual program is not currently available, the student in placed in a Freestanding English as a New Language  Program, and is provided an alternate-placement paraprofessional.  Native language support is provided, where necessary,  through the use of bilingual   paraprofessionals, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, and native-language literature.      Amongst the academic strategies utilized may include, but are not limited to; the use of manipulatives, hands-on activities,  books on tape, native language material and support, and big books for shared reading.  Making text connections and setting  up cooperative learning groups where lower-functioning students are paired with more advanced students, are excellent tools  for fostering student interaction, comprehension and self-awareness. Technology used to support ELL-SWD's includes, but is  not limited to: Rosetta Stone, Think Cerca, BrainPop, Starfall, Math IXL, iReady, and ALEKS.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ELL instructional team works closely with the School Assessment Team in order to develop IEP goals and recommendations  for ELL-SWDs.  This ensures that we meet the diverse needs of this population, within the least restrictive environment.  ELL  and bilingual teachers work with classroom teachers, as well as collaborative teacher teams in order to design appropriate  curricular andinstructional plans and units of study for our ELL-SWDs.  ENL program scheduling ensures that these students  receive ENL support during literacy instruction.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  As a result of the interrogation of multiple data sources, we identify those students, including ELLs, who require targeted  intervention.  In conjunction with our RTI (Response to Intervention) program, we provide small group instruction, tailored to  meet the specific individual needs of our students, in all content areas of deficiency.  In some cases, students who are on one  grade level, may benefit from skills and strategy instruction from a lower grade level.  Skills, such as phonemic awareness,  segmenting, chaining, blending, to name a few, are infused into daily RTI instruction, to ensure that these students will reach  their grade level expectations within a reasonable amount of time.  Fountas and Pinnell assessment data allows us to  formulate additional, appropriate, differentated literacy groups.  This, in turn, allows for more individualized, guided  instruction, tailored to the specific needs of the students, ensuring that they, too, reach their appropriate grade level  expectation, within a reasonable amount of time.   The same strategies are utilized, with regard to mathematics  intervention.  Student data allows for more individualized, guided instruction, tailored to the specific deficiencies of  students.  Small group intervention allows for greater differentiated instruction of the mathematical skills needed to bring the  students up to their grade level, within a reasonable amount of time.  The language for this instruction is English.       All science and social studies programs utlized at our school incorporate ongoing assessment, in order to monitor student  progress.  Additionally, the New York City Performance Assessment in Social Studies is administered three times per year, to  students in grades six through eight, not for MoSL purposes, but to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of our  students.  The data from these assessments helps to drive our Targeted Intervention program, in which students are placed in  small groups for tutoring during AIS periods, and for small group instruction during class time.  Bilingual glossaries and  dictionaries are utlized in order to foster the native langauge, along with picture dictionaries, translated vocabulary support,  and translated student articles, where necessary.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      For the 2017-2018 school year, we will be instituting a Dual Language program in Kindergarten.  It was noted, in the previous  school year, that there was a significant population of Spanish-speaking students in our pre-Kindergarten.  This led to the  creation of the Dual Language class.  Students have been placed in this program, based upon parent request.       We will be utilizing the Performance Series diagnostic assessment to students in grades 3 through eight, beginning in the 2017- 18 school year, as well.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not closed our bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELL students are fully integrated in the mainstream classes, and are afforded equal access to all school-wide  programs.  Our school offers a wide array of extracurricular activities, which include STEM, dance, art, music and cooking.  Our  vibrant art program is taught by a seasoned teacher, and is available to both general and special education students.  In  addition, decadent cooking and life-skill classes are taught in our, state-of-the-art culinary kitchen.  Our music program teaches  students to use various instruments, including, but not limited to, the recorder, drums, ukulele and guitar.  We have an  extensive music program for all students in grades K-2, involving the use of musical instruments, as well as extensive plays and  songs, supporting our goal of language development.  In addition to the aforementioned, our dance, art and music  departments work in tandem to develop an extensive theatrical production, incorporating a major portion of the student  body.  All ELLs are fully represented in all programs offered in our school.  ELLs do not receive separate invitations to  participate in these programs, as they are programmed to participate alongside their non-ELL peers.         We are continuing to implement the Studio in a School program, which is offered to students in grades Pre-Kindergarten and  Kindergarten.  This exciting program offers students the opportunity to create exciting, hands-on art projects, with the  assistance of professional artists.  We are also continuing and expanding our Cook Shop program, which allows students to  explore the foundations of nutrition and healthy eating.  Again, ELLs are programmed to participate in this program, alongside  their non-ELL peers.       We are entering the fifth year of our STEM program.  STEM is an interdisciplinary program that focuses on science, technology,  engineering and math. We have chosen to focus on these areas together, not only because the skills and knowledge in each  discipline are essential for student success, but also because these fields are deeply intertwined in the real world and in how  students learn most effectively. STEM is an integrative and applied approach that is coupled with hands-on, problem-based  learning. A STEM-literate student is not only an innovator and critical thinker, but is able to make meaningful connections  between school, community, and global issues.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We are using the following instructional materials to support ELLs:     - Core Knowledge  - Expeditionary Learning  - Go Math  - Math IXL  - Connected Math  - ALEKS  - Think Cerca  - Rosetta Stone  - Boardworks  - Raz Kids   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      - BrainPop  - Passport to Social Studies  - Attainment Literacy  - Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Attanasio and Associates   - Primary Sources, Teacher Created Materials  - More True Stories, Longman  - Oxford Picture Dictionary, Oxford University Press  - Word by Word Picture Dictionary, Longman  - Side by Side English, Longman     The Core Knowledge program is being used with students in grades K - 2.  The program consists of two strands: the Listening  and Learning Strand and the Skills Strands.  The Listening and Learning Strand consists of listening activities, vast vocabulary  extension, dramatic play, photos, and extensive literary prose in various genres.  Each grade level focuses on multiple domains,  which include an extensive variety of topical genres, fostering voluminous language development in the four modalities of  listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The second strand, the Skills Strand, focuses heavily on reading readiness strategies,  including; phonemeic awareness, letter, sound and word recognition.  The program utilizes the paramount strategies of  chaining, segmenting, and blending to foster literacy development.       The Expeditionary Learning program is used with students in grades three through eight. The program focuses on various  genres, providing extensive information on areas studied.  Students learn "close reading" strategies, at all grade levels,  including finding the gist, using context clues, citing evidence, making inferences, paying attention to vocabulary and being  able to respond to text-dependent questions in the domains studied.  The program exposes the students to higher-level  thinking, which will further assist in college and career readiness.      Our school uses technology at its highest form with the innovative use of SmartBoards and Promethean boards, classroom  computers, individual laptops and iPads to supplement classroom instruction in various content-areas.  All of our classrooms  are equipped with state-of-the-art SmartBoards, enabling all students to be engaged, while interactively visualizing  instruction.      We will continue to utilize the BrainPop website, which offers short, engaging cartoon clips that explain topics covering math,  science, grammar, geography, history, and writing.  The videos have accompanying activities to reinforce the skills and  strategies introduced in the videos.        We will continue to partner with the Cook Shop organization for this school year.  This program, utilized with students in Pre- Kindergarten through grade four, teaches children where food comes from, how it is grown, and how it is produced.  Our  parents have been invited to participate in a parallel adult Cook Shop program, in which they utilize the same ingredients that  their children are using in their classrooms.  While the children prepare cold dishes with these ingredients, the adults prepare  hot dishes in our kitchen classroom.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We utilize students’ native language by pairing newcomers with more advanced students who share a common native  language.  In addition, we use bilingual dictionaries, word-to-word glossaries, and translated material to foster native language  use.  Age and grade-appropriate Native Language Arts books that support the Core Curriculum are utilized, wherever possible.  We also sponsor multicultural activities and performances to enhance knowledge of all cultures.  We involve parents of various  linguistic backgrounds in our many school activities, as well.  In our Dual Language kindergarten, first and second-grade classes,  Spanish is the home language for both the ELLs and non-ELLs.  Spanish language instruction is delivered and infused into the  content areas of math and social studies.  Unit assessments will be utilized order to assess home language support in the  content that is taught in the native language.  Native Language support in the ENL program is assessed through the  administration of the Spanish Lab and SIFE Screener, where applicable.  City and state exams are also administered in the  native language, wherever possible in order to assess native language.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All students, including ELLs, are placed in grade and age-appropriate classes with their peers.  Materials are age appropriate,  and are used to build capacity and comprehension, appropriate to the grade level of the students.  In addition to the resources  mentioned above, we also use a variety of technology-based programs that are age and grade appropriate, including; Think  Cerca, BrainPop, Math IXL, Raz Kids, ALEKS, iReady, Rosetta Stone and Boardworks.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We share our school building with a District 75 school.  This school has their own programs and administration, along with  their own ELL-support staff.  We make every effort to include this school in some of our major school events including our  annual carnival, Thanksgiving feast and assembly programs, where appropriate.  Staff members from both schools are on the  building Safety Team, Code Blue Team and Collaborative Schools Committee, in an effort to facilitate the sharing of ideas and  resources and coordinate efforts to ensure the the needs of all students are met.  In addition, when appropriate and  recommended by the D75 PIP team, certain students from their school are mainstreamed into our school's classes for certain  subjects, in an effort to provide a more challenging and less restrictive environment for their students.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Continuing students, including newcomer ELLs, receive reading packets at the end of June.  These packets contain a suggested  list of grade-appropriate texts that students are encouraged to read over the summer, in preparation for the upcoming school  year.   While we make every effort to support our ELLs during the summer, new students typically enroll at the beginning of  the school year.  It is therefore difficult to assist newly enrolled ELLs before September.  New ELLs who enroll throughout the  school year are immediate placed in the appropriate classes, and are provided with the mandated services.  Students at the  entering and emerging proficiency levels in grades 2-8 are provided with Rosetta Stone accounts in order to facilitate their  language acquisition.  Our pupil accounting secretary and parent coordinator assist newly-enrolled ELLs and their families  acclimate to the school community through dissemination of important information regarding school schedule, upcoming  events and services and programs that are available.  Our guidance counselors work with our ELL population in order to ensure  they know their options regarding middle school and high school admissions.  Middle and high-school fairs and visits are  orchestrated by the guidance staff.  They facilitate parent workshops that highlight specialized middle and high school  programs offered in the area.  All of these activities are offered to all students, including ELLs, as they are fully integrated into  our school community.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    For the 2017-2018 school year, we will continue our Spanish elective class for all students, including ELLs, in grade seven.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a.) In our dual language program, the side-by-side model is utilized.  The ELLs and the English proficient  students are integrated throughout the school day.  ELLs are placed in differentiated, guided groups  during the school day, as well.  b.)  The subject areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies are taught in English, while .    c.) During content area instruction, the classroom teacher delivers instruction in English.  This is then  followed up by the material being delivered in Spanish.  d.) As stated above, both languages are taught at the same time, in an effort to foster literacy in both   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         languages.             Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  As per the new UFT contract, all teachers participate in professional development activities on Monday afternoons after  student dismissal.  Over the course of the school year, teachers will receive ongoing training on the following topics:  - New curriculum and technology programs, including, but not limited to: ThinkCerca, iReady, Boardworks, STEM, Science  Fusion, and Cookshop.  - ELL-related topics including the new CR Part 154 mandates, ELL Policy Reference Guide, best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs and preparing students for the NYS ELA, NYS Math Exam  and the NYSESLAT.  Teachers will also participate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC's), during which they will study academic and  research-based texts aimed at improving and enhancing instruction for ELLs.  The group is currently studying the book  "Creating Robust Vocabulary", by Isabel Beck.      All teachers, including those of ELLs, have received extensive training on the CCLS, over the course of the past few years.  All  curriculum is aligned to the CCLS.  Any new programs that are being introduced, including Think Cerca, iReady, and Boardworks  are aimed at helping all students, including ELLs to effectively engage in the CCLS.  These programs are desinged to  supplement, differentiate and individualize instruction for our students so that they can meet the challenges of the Common  Core.  As stated above (in question #1), all teachers will receive training in these new programs.       As stated above, all teachers of ELLs, including ENL and bilingual teachers, will receive ongoing training on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.  These professional development sessions  highlight ways in which CCLS-aligned instruction can be scaffolded and differentiated for ELLs.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In an effort to ease the transition from elementary to middle school, students in grades five and six are nested in their  individual classrooms, where their departmentalized content area teachers provide instruction.  In addition, students in grade  five are invited to an orientation, along with their parents, in which they receive information about various instructional and  extracurricular programs that will be available to them as they transition from elementary to middle school.  All staff members,  including the guidance counselor, receive training on ELL-related topics throughout the school year.  One such topic includes  an overview of the transition from elementary to middle school and from middle to high school.  Specific ENL and bilingual  programs offered at potential high schools are a point of discussion and consideration.  Our staff developer, in conjunction  with our school guidance counselor, periodically take our eighth grade students on field trips to local high schools, in order to  prepare them for the high school experience. In addition, students in grade eight are invited to the various high school fairs,  held throughout the city.   Each school must provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs  of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all  teachers must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language  teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language  acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content   instruction for English language learners.  To this end, we will be implementing the professional development plan, as outlined   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         in questions #1-3, see above).  Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to; the ELL identification process, NYSITELL,  NYSESLAT and ELL Periodic Assessments, co-teaching strategies for ELLs, language development strategies,  scaffolding instruction for ELLs, building academic language, and RTI instruction for ELLs, and unpacking the CCLS for ELLs.  The  presenters for each of these professional development sessions are responsible for the preparation and distribution of  agendas, which are kept on file in the main office.  Attendance sheets are maintained for all participants and are kept on file by  the pupil accounting secretary.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In an effort to bridge the home-school connection, we set aside time on Tuesday afternoons for Parent Engagement.  This time  is utilized in order to hold individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss student goals, progress in language development,  NYSESLAT results, and instructional needs.  Translation services are always avaialble during these sessions, as our school has  many staff members who act as bilingual interpreters.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement in our school inclides recruiting efforts to involve all parents, including those of our ELLs, as  volunteers.  We also include parents as participants in school decisions, governance, and advocacy through councils, leadership  committees, organizations and workshops.     For the 2017-2018 school year, we will be holding English as a New Language classes for all intersted parents, including those  of ELLs.  This class meets twice per week and is taught by a school secretary and a guidance counselor.     Parent workshops are held regularly, throughout the school year, in order to keep parents informed of importat information  regarding new programs, curriculum, and the Common Core Learning Standards.  Topics to be addressed for the current school  year includem but are not limited to:   - Understanding the Parent Roadmap, a grade-by-grade breakdown of Common Core expectations  - Step-by-Step to College  - Accessing Engrade, Math IXL, Mathletics, and Think Cerca in the home  - Social Media and Internet Safety  - Visiting Author Day        To further encourage parent participation and involvement in their chlldren's education, computer stattions have been set up  for parental use.  Staff members are on hand to coach and explain how to access their children's test performance data, as well  as Pupil Path, our school-wide, computer-based grading program.  In addition, parent-teacher conferences are held four times  per school year, giving parents and opportunity to speak directly with their children's teachers and other school-based  staff.  This affords them the ability to get involved in their child's education and stay abreast of important, ongoing, as well as  future events, involving their children.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Harla Joy Musoff-Weiss, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S./I.S. 238                                                                              School DBN: 21K238  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Based on the various home languages, gathered by the ELL Department from the respective Home Language  Survey Forms, as well as the information on parent's preferred language of communication gathered by our pupil  accounting secretary, we assess the written translation and oral interpretation needs of the parent population.
