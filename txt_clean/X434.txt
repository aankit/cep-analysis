This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   General Information and Mission Statement    Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to prepare college-bound students for the world of higher education through a rigorous academic  program provided by an inspired and caring staff in a small learning community.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Belmont Preparatory High School is a small college preparatory school which emphasizes early college awareness  beginning in ninth grade and interwoven throughout the curriculum and through all grade levels. We were founded as  a “haven” for academically talented students from the local community and have become exactly that.    Belmont is situated in the Theodore Roosevelt Educational Campus in the South Central Bronx. We share and  collaborate with five sister schools at the Roosevelt site. We currently have a register of 408 students and can boast a  low student to teacher ratio of fewer than 15:1. It is this small size that enables us to serve the needs of each  individual child and to develop specialized programs to meet individual student needs.    Instructional Focus and Priorities   In accordance with our mission, we offer over a two year cycle, six Advanced Placement Courses including  Environmental Science, U.S. History, English Literature, Spanish Language, Calculus, and Computer Science. We have  partnered with Bronx Community College in order to offer two college level classes each semester, for eleventh grade  student as well as two introductory non-credit bearing courses for tenth graders. We also offer a wide variety of  academic electives including Digital Music Composition, Music Appreciation, and instrumental Music, Creative Arts,  Art History, Forensic Science, and Spanish. These courses compliment a core curriculum that is common core aligned  and purposed towards fulfilling our core mission. Our teachers work collaboratively to create unit plans, address the  needs of ENL’s and SWD’s with care and dedication alike. We are set apart, in particular, because our small staff which  is marked by low turn-over rate is motivated by a shared vision of educational excellence to meet our collectively high  standards.       Our instructional priorities for SY19:   1. Continue our writing focus, for SY2019 students will complete a minimum of Eight essays/rich tasks, two per term  in each core subject. ELA essays will be expository, persuasive, argumentative, reflective, and creative in nature. In the  fine arts, students will assemble a cumulative portfolio of work which includes written descriptors of the works and  expository/reflective essays. All essays and tasks will be clearly outlined and explained in unit maps and plans.    2. Continue creating increased opportunities for students to make up assignments through their participation in  structured pair/group/cooperative activities, which support and serve as a foundation for student centered  accountable talk/discussion and provide ample opportunity for student voice.    3. Continue closing the gap between graduation and college readiness . As a participating school in the NYC DOE  College Access for all initiative, we will expand supplement our already well-established college going culture by  further infusing within our already rich curriculum additional structures and supports to further prepare students for  the world of college and the career of THEIR choosing.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4. Continue increasing AP and other College Preparatory course offerings in SY2018 to include AP English Language  and Composition and AP Statistics. For SY2019 we plan to roll out AP World History, AP Seminar and AP Service  Learning.   5. Continue to expand Professional development opportunities for teachers to increase their capacity to apply content  shifts to suit the needs of our diverse learners across all content areas, and to further challenge students, provide  actionable feedback and develop more engaging rigorous assignments. For SY2019, we plan to expand opportunities  for teachers to participate in professional development that increases the number of teachers in leadership roles and  expands their capacity to provide effective feedback to other teachers.          Educational Partnerships Families and Opportunities   We endeavor this year to expand our community and parent involvement component. We emphasize educational  opportunities which break down the barriers of the classroom and partner with the larger community beyond our  walls. Integral to our educational approach are our partnerships with The College Bound Initiative (CBI), The Brooklyn  Academy of Music, Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society, The Lincoln Center Theater, Project LEAP, The New York  Botanical Gardens, The Dolan DNA Center, Fordham University Liberty Partners Program, Fordham University Let's  Get Ready (SAT Prep)The Salvadori Center for Art and Architecture, The New York City Bar Association, Groundwork  Hudson Valley, Generation Citizen, Capital One Bank, The United Nations, The Jewish Museum, The National  September 11 Memorial and Museum, The United Nations, Bronx Community College STEP, and many more. Our  partnerships are designed to provide our students with educational experiences which are fully integrated into the  curriculum and afford students the experience of exploring the manner in which academic knowledge is practically  realized. Additionally, learning takes place at home in a way that is reinforced by classroom instruction. As such, we  are expanding our Google Classroom model to break down the traditional classroom walls and truly expands our  home/ school nexus of partnership.   College Awareness   College awareness is integral to our educational mission. Opportunities to explore the world of higher education  imbue our educational program. Our first year students are provided the opportunity to visit local colleges,  universities, and attend early awareness college fairs with Belmont staff and with family. Beginning sophomore year  and continuing into their third year, students have the opportunity to travel and visit select colleges and universities  in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regions twice per year. Each year seventy individual students, almost twenty  percent of our population have the opportunity to participate in these overnight college trips. Institutions visited  include, Dartmouth College, Mt. Holyoke College, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst College, MIT, The  University of Pennsylvania,Cornell University, SUNY Binghampton, SUNY Albany, SUNY Cortland, Howard University,  Ithaca College, Colgate University, George Washington University, Georgetown University, Harvard University,  Northeastern University, Boston University, Boston College, Temple University, Drexel University, Lemoyne College  and many others. We provide fourth year students with access to a cutting edge technological center in order for  them to prepare applications to the college or university of their choice. We also provide SAT preparation classes after  school for EVERY 11th and 12th grader through Fordham University's Let's Get Ready programs. Furthermore, SAT  prep methodology is infused into our third and fourth year instructional program. Continue to strengthen our  partnership with the city's College Access for all initiative. We will use the resources brought by our college access  coach in order to further our already strong college going culture.    Distinctive Features and Student Centered Activities   A unique and successful educational programs is our ninth grade science literacy course. All ninth grade students take  Living Environment and a ninety minute common core aligned ELA course. In addition to these science content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      ELA core courses our students take science literacy taught by a living environment and an ELA or ESL teacher. The  program provides students with an intensive science based course which focuses on reading original source material  and developing the skills required to successfully master non-fiction science based writing tasks. Building off of our  successful participation in the Learning Partners Program, our experienced teacher leaders will continue to facilitate  teacher teamwork at grade level and across the curriculum and to further develop the leadership capacity of our  teacher leaders. These teacher leaders will continue to facilitate our grade level and departmental meetings and our  inquiry work as we look to continue the process of refining our curricula.    To create a holistic well rounded student citizen, supplemental student activities are necessary. Students and staff  together design and create student after-school and supplemental programs. The National Honor Society, HisStory,  Just for Girls and Turn to Her, and Mentoring Latina programs are Belmont success stories which provide educational  opportunities, mentoring, college awareness and service opportunities to Belmont women.    We also offer a wide variety of student led extra-curricular programs including student government, photography  club, soccer club, yearbook publishing, swim club, and Junior States Association. We also host numerous PSAL athletic  teams including, Varsity and Junior Varsity Boys’ Basketball, girls’ and boys’ volleyball, girls’ softball, boys’ baseball,  co-ed swimming. The campus hosts intramural flag football every Fall and a basketball tournament every Spring for  Roosevelt Campus bragging rights.    For the past four years, Belmont students in good standing have had the opportunity to travel abroad and overseas to  Italy, France, The United Kingdom, Quebec, as well as within the U.S to Puerto Rico and New Orleans as part of our  travel club. For SY2018 , the travel club is planning a trip to Europe's Mediterranean Coast with an education focus on  Modern and Baroque Art and History. These educational trips offer students the opportunity not only to explore  historical sites, artistic treasures, and natural wonders, but in the planning, provide them the opportunity to learn  about financing their dreams and budgeting their personal resources.    Professional Development   Our professional development plan is multi-faceted and differentiated and provides teachers with a variety of  opportunities for professional enrichment. The primary venue for professional development involves twice weekly  departmental and grade level meetings. Teachers review curricula, units, questions, tasks through the prism of The  Common Core Learning Standards and examine student outcomes. Using an inquiry based approach, teachers  collectively examine student outcomes with an eye towards adjusting and improving curricula, units, questions and  tasks. The process is ongoing and designed to result in improved student learning outcomes. Additionally,  mathematics instructors will participate in New Visions professional development in order to improve mathematical  instruction. U.S. History teachers will continue to participate in and the Gilder Lehrman Institute Teaching History  through Literacy U.S. History program. We will continue to participate in the New Visions for Public Schools Global  History Curriculum Program and the U.S. History Curriculum Programs, as well as the Living Environment, Earth  Science and Chemistry and Physics Curriculum Pilots. Our ICT teachers in all departments will participate in specific  professional development through our New Visions partners which will provide them the opportunity to explore more  fully the team teaching model as it relates to their specific subject area in which they teach.    For SY19, we will be expanding our PD to include Growth Mindset and Emotional Intelligence. For this purpose we  have contracted the Quest-On Project. This organization is designed to provide a safe space for students and faculty  members to dive deeply into several aspects of their personal scholastic and professional growth. The professional  development is centered around their five pillars which include:   1. Choice   2. Purpose   3. Fearlessness   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      4. Interconnectedness   5. Bigger Picture   We intend to continue working with them in order to improve our college and career readiness indexes.    Parental Outreach   Belmont is truly a family. We are proud that parents of our original classes continue to send the younger siblings of  our graduates to Belmont. These “legacy” families are a testament to the fine work we have done and continue to do  at Belmont. In fact, 95% of parents report being satisfied or extremely satisfied with the education their child receives  at Belmont. We strongly believe that in order to fully actualize all educational opportunities provided to students at  Belmont, the entire family must be integrated into our school community. To this end, we have established a number  of activities designed to integrate families in our community. In addition to the customary open school/parent teacher  conferences, we have established a series of grade level parent conferences scheduled at strategic times throughout  the school year. In addition to regular IEP meetings, we have also scheduled parent meetings in order to share  information with parents about student transitional activities. For our incoming students we hold an informational  session each Fall and an orientation to the school culture in the Spring. For SY2019 we plan to increase the number of  Parent Teacher Conferences to include a New Parent Meet & Greet during the September open school dates.       General Accomplishments   As a result of our small size, our small classes, and our knowledge of the individual needs of our learners we have  been able to prepare them for college. Over the years, we have significantly increased the number of students who  have been accepted to top rated schools of a national caliber. By maintaining a small Guidance Counselor caseload,  we have allowed for our Senior Guidance Counselor to focus on all areas of student growth and maturation. This  forward planning has allowed her to significantly assist our students in the college application process. We are proud  to brag that our small school has students who have been accepted to:   Fordham University   John Jay College     Cornell University    Colgate University    Dartmouth College  Stanford University      Babson College    Vassar College      The George Washington University      Hofstra University    Holy Cross College    Howard University      Pace University    NYU    Northeastern University    Penn State University    The University of Rochester       Syracuse University  SUNY Buffalo   Ithaca College   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      The schools listed above are but a few of the elite institutions to which our students have been accepted throughout  the years. Though this list represents some fine institutions, we are most proud to have afforded our students choice  in colleges and universities in accord with our mission.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We strongly believe that students learn best when they are encouraged to develop an innate inquisitiveness. As such,  our curriculum and learning tasks have been structured in order to promote student centered inquiry and deep  engagement for all students especially our ENL's and students with IEP's. Inquisitive learners become independent  learners who are more concerned with the “why” of things as opposed to simply the “what”. Our curricula and our  focus are designed to facilitate the development of students into life-long inquisitive learners.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The area in which we made the greatest progress this year has been in the area of collaborative teachers. Teacher  teams have matured in their capacity to identify curricular issues which hinder student progress, to target these areas  for improvement and to monitor student progress. Our focus for the upcoming year is to continue to foster  collaborative teachers through our new I.C.T. classes and with the assistance of our College Bound Initiative Team that  will increase the collaboration between our guidance counselors and college advisor and classroom teachers through  a curricular analysis and incorporation of SAT strategies into the curriculum.                For SY2018, we strengthened our curriculum by align CCLS across the subject areas, we have implemented  weekly subject area teacher team meetings in order to afford teachers the opportunity to plan cooperatively.  For SY2019 We plan to continue supporting subject area teacher team meetings and to leverage best  practices learned as part of their inquiry cycle.  For SY2018, we have leveraged what we learned from our Partnership with Learning Partners Program  participation and continue to improve our teacher practices, provide teacher input in developing and revising  curricula and pedagogy and to develop best practices in coordination with our partner schools. For SY2018  and SY2019, we will continue to strengthen our knowledge base with our participation in Team Cintron/New  Vision Leadership Academy. The work of the academy will facilitate the continued development of systems  and structures to support our instructional priorities for SY2018 and SY2019 and set students up for success in  Advanced Placement Courses and College and other College and Career Preparatory Courses and exams.  For SY2018, 9th grade curricula provide a strong foundation for rigorous writing, structures and techniques for  reading of non-fiction and argumentative skills necessary for persuasive writing. 9th grade ELA, Science  Literacy, and social studies courses reflect the High School Writing Scope and Sequence so as to lay the proper  foundation for students to graduate in four years college and career ready. For SY2019, we plan expand  opportunities for students to sit for the ELA Regents at the end of their 9th grade, allowing students an  additional opportunity to become college ready and increasing the number of students eligible for College  Now and College Preparatory Courses.  For SY2018, teacher teams promote the use of common pedagogical approaches such as Socratic Seminars,  student directed lessons, pair-share, annotation, close reading, and concept mapping among others so that  students, as they progress academically through their high school careers, will be well versed in these  strategies across the curricula and well prepared for college and career. For SY2019, we continue to expand  opportunities for student collaborative reading and writing by increasing the number of teachers making use  of effective comprehension strategies that enhance content area learning such as Collaborative Strategic  Reading and collaborative writing platforms such as Google docs and goobric to provide group feedback.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X434   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   402   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As a result of our concentrated efforts, our median four year graduation rate has been 88% since SY2015. class of  2016 was 83%. SY2018 and SY2019 we are projecting graduation rates within the same range (83%-92%). We  continue the same focused concentration as we looked to revise curricula to make it more accessible to all students  and to increase student engagement and overall achievement. As we as continue to increase opportunities for  students to persue new state approved pathways to graduation.    June SY2018 Regents data for first time test-takers reveals that for Cohort 2019 students the passing rate for US  History decreased from 94% last June to 85%.    For Cohort 2020, while the percent of students achieving CR increased to 32% from 20% during the SY2017 June  administration, the overall passing rate decreased to 58% from 81% last year. As we further delve into the Regents  Item Analysis Data, we have identified four standards where students scored below city average:      Reading Informational Text RI.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text,   including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings; analyze how an author uses and refines the  meaning of a key term or terms over the course of a text (e.g., how Madison defines faction in Federalist No.  10).      Reading Literature RL 2: Determine two or more themes or central ideas of a text and analyze their   development over the course of the text, including how they interact and build on one another to produce a  complex account; provide an objective summary of the text.      Reading Literature RL 3: Analyze the impact of the author's choices regarding how to develop and relate   elements of a story or drama (e.g., where a story is set, how the action is ordered, how the characters are  introduced and developed).      Reading Literature RL 4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including   figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone,  including words with multiple meanings or language that is particularly fresh, engaging, or beautiful. (Include  Shakespeare as well as other authors.)    The same cohort of students had a passing rate of 75% in the Global History Regents compared to 79% for the  corresponding cohort during the June SY2017 administration.    For Cohort 2021, the overall passing rate for Algebra 1 decreased to 37% from 60% for the corresponding cohort the  previous year. Similarly, CR achievement decreased from 47% to 27%. As we further delve into the Regents Item  Analysis Data, we have identified four standards where students scored below city average:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16                  ( A-REI.B ) Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities REI.B: Solve equations and inequalities in one variable.,  B.3 Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable, including equations with coefficients represented  by letters., B.4 Solve quadratic equations in one variable.   ( A-SSE.A ) Seeing Structure in Expressions SSE.A:Interpret the structure of expressions., A.1 Interpret  expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context., A.2 Use the structure of an expression to  identify ways to rewrite it. For example, see x^4 - y^4 as (x^2)^2 - (y^2)^2, thus recognizing it as a difference  of squares that can be factored as (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2).   ( F-LE.A ) Linear, Quadratic, & Exponential Models LE.A: Construct and compare linear, quadratic, and  exponential models and solve problems., A.1 Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear  functions and with exponential functions., A.2 Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic  and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include  reading these from a table)., A.3 Observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially  eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly, quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function.,  A.4 For exponential models, express as a logarithm the solution to abct = d where a, c, and d are numbers and  the base b is 2, 10, or e; evaluate the logarithm using technology. Interpret expressions for functions in terms  of the situation they model.

Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the data (including joint, marginal, and  conditional relative frequencies). Recognize possible associations and trends in the data., B.6 Represent data  on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.    The same cohort of students had a passing rate of 63% in the Living Environment Regents compared to 70% for the  corresponding cohort during the June SY2017 administration.    Student credit accumulation (ten credits or more) in the first year of high school dropped from 86% in 2016-2017 to  83% in 2017-2018 and remained at 83% for second year students. Both cohorts remained above the comparison  group.       For SY2018 and SY2019, we continue to focus on a commonly aligned, collaboratively planned and taught ninth grade  curriculum. We also continue to leverage the work that our ninth grade science and literacy teachers do in team  teaching a course focused on analysis of scientific writings and writing about science. This has produced strong  Regents passing rate for student’s first science exam in each of the last two years (SY2016 and SY2015) with passing  rates over 90%. However this positive trend has slowed for the 2021 cohort. In particular, Regents results for the  Living Environment exam shows a steep decline in the passing rate for our 2021 cohort. Further examination of this  data indicates that our ELL's students have a passing rate far lower then their Ged Ed counterparts. The same  disaggregated data shows that our self-contained SpEds and SpEds with SETTS services passed the exam at a rate  comparable to their Gen Ed counterparts. The same trends overall hold for our ninth grade students in mathematics.  For SY2018 and SY2019 we continue to strengthen our team approach to common lesson planning. Again a positive  trend, but a clear concern for our ENL population in the 2020 cohort. Global passing rate for first time test takers  continue in the 70s. Preliminary credit accumulation data for the 2021 cohort also shows a decline in scholarship with  35% of ninth graders (again disproportionately ENL's) requiring summer school classes in order to be promoted to the  tenth grade. Overall however the number of tenth graders and eleventh graders who are retained pending summer  school has declined. For the 2019 cohort , over 90% of eleventh graders, moved to the twelfth grade. In summary,  data for our ENL's and our 2021 cohort, shows we must diligently focus on addressing the trends highlighted above.  The focus on improving achievement for our ENL's and our overall Living Environment and Algebra Common Core  achievement will be a focus for SY2018 and SY2019. This will be addressed through: Commonly aligned collaboratively  planned courses; Commonly aligned performance tasks; Targeted academic intervention services for ENL's and ENL's  with IEP's for our 2020 cohort; Increased student engagement; Focus on student engagement in lower level science  and mathematics courses geared towards improvement in scholarship and Regents performance.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Crafting and refinement Common Core aligned units, including  rigorous assessments and performance tasks.   All Students   4. Improve the functionality of grade-level teams.   5. Improved inquiry work targeting ENL's specifically.   Rigorous Instruction will include:   ● Writing Goal: Students will write a minimum of six essays (one  per marking period) in ELA, two expository/research essays in  history (one per term) and one rich task per unit in math and  Science. ELA essays will be expository, persuasive,  argumentative, reflective, and creative in nature. In the fine arts,  students will assemble a cumulative portfolio of work which  includes written descriptors of the works and  expository/reflective essays.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  2017-18 marked a reversal of the decline in the number of safety related incidents for the second straight year, which  contrasts the case over the course of the past five years. According to OSYD posted information, there were still only  nine incidents of student-student violence in the 2017-18 school year, but this represented an increase from 7 in the  previous year. Overall, data for the 2017-18 school year indicates an increase from 48 to 56 incidents. The largest  number of increases however can be attributed to an increased reporting of incidents of bullying (inter-campus  conflicts) and particularly cyber-bullying related to an increased awareness of this on the part of parents and an  increase in reporting to the school of these incidents. The overall reduction in the number of incidents however still  represents a decline from 58 in 2013-14 to 44 in 2014-15, to 34 in 2015-16, a decrease since 2013-14, but an increase  since 2015-16. Level 4 occurrences also rose, from 23 in 2016-17 to 29 in 2017-18 with level five occurrences  decreasing from 7 to 3. The increased vigilance in addressing the bullying has created a safe school environment  (according to the 2017-18 student survey data 90% of students feel safe in classes) and has translated to overall  Principal's suspensions going from fourteen in SY 2016 to twenty-four in SY 2017. However, Superintendent's  suspensions saw a sharp decrease from eleven to four. Additionally, as a result of our continued reliance on a  restorative approach, the number of reported incidents of insubordination B-21 dropped from 21 in 2013-14 to 8 in  2014-15 and three in 2015-16 to zero in 2016-17 and likewise to zero in 2017-18. Respect, restorative justice, and  peaceful conflict resolution has become a centerpiece of our school culture. As a result, suspensions year to year had  declined over the past five years for Principal’s suspensions as reflected in OSYD data. 2014-15 data indicate a decline  to 34 total suspensions down from 2012-13 which saw 83 total suspensions. 2015-16 continued this trend with only  14 Principal's Suspensions and one Superintendent's suspension and 2016-17 confirmed the impact of our restorative  approach and with fourteen Principal level suspensions. 2017-18 did see us return to Principal's suspension numbers  not experienced since the 2014-15 school year. With regards to the positive impact and pointed decrease in  Superintendent's suspensions for 2017-18 , three were related to the inadvertent bringing in of weapons to scanning  by students, which required an automatic Superintendent's suspension request. One incident was related to an event  which involved a Belmont student and a student from another campus.    Since 2014-15 we have created an overall supportive environment at Belmont with no disparity to date in the number  of male/female suspensions. For 2015-16, these trends continued in a positive direction. For 2017-18 these trends  continued with no disparity in racial, ethnic, or gender categories. The overall number of suspensions for students  with IEP's was of a higher proportion than their representation in the school population during the 2017-18 school  year. Additionally, the suspension rate for black and Hispanic students was proportionate to their respective  percentage of the school population. Additionally, students report in the 2017-18 school survey that they strongly  agree or agree that they feel safe in classes (90% strongly agree or agree) and in hallways, in bathrooms, locker  rooms, cafeteria (85% strongly agree or agree). In addition, based on the school survey, only 24% of students  continued to report that they felt unsafe outside (which is a decrease in 10% from 2016-17) and around the school  while 18% (a decrease in 3% from 2016-2017) reported feeling unsafe traveling between home and school. The  disparity from inside the school building to outside and around the school building indicates that the Fordham  Community and the NYPD must continue to address the overall safety of the Fordham Road corridor, on which we are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      located and specifically the area around Fordham Plaza which is a major transportation hub and continues to be a  gathering spot for undesirable activities unrelated to the school.    Also using the school survey results from 2013-14 as a baseline and despite the positive trends in creating a school  environment that is safe and marked by respect for all, in 2013-14, only 64% of students reported that there were  enough activities to keep students interested in school. By 2014-15, this number increased to 70% of students  reporting that there are enough activities to keep them interested in school. As a result, of this finding from 2013-14,  we embarked on an effort to create additional positive activities for students in the 2014-15. The data from 2015-16  survey indicates an increase to 78% and to 81% for 2016-17. This effort re stabilized during the 2017-18 year back to  78%. We will be keenly reviewing the data in order to determine how best to modify this goal for 2018-19 with a  particular focus on students with IEP's who based on community involvement indicators on IEP's lag behind general  education peers in the rate of participation in student activities. Preliminary internal data related to student  participation in school activities indicates that we have increased the number of students participating from fewer  than sixty to more than 100 individual participants for 2016-17 (many students participate in multiple activities, but  are only counted once for this study). This positive trend has continued for 2017-18 and reflects our efforts to  increase student participation school-wide and across all grade levels. This preliminary statistic shows the desired  result of our 2014-15 focus, however, the number of students with IEP's participating in extra-curricular activities lags  significantly behind their general education peers. This indicates that the school is still not doing enough to provide a  supportive and engaging school environment for all students. In order to create more student-centered programs and  a school that truly belongs to the students, we have developed the goal and action plan that follows.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  Implement strategies to increase student participation, specifically for students with IEP's in the school culture and to  promote academic, social, emotional, development of our students with a specific focus on participation in the non- academic life of the school community through additional clubs, family activities, and one-time celebrations by June  2019 as measured by a 3- 5% increase in the total number of students participating and in the activities offered, with  a specific focus on students with IEP's who participate in at least one extra-curricular activity.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Starting in SY2015-16 we made a concerted effort to focus on data which would identify students at risk of not  graduating within four years. As a result of this concentrated effort, our four year graduation rate for class of 2017  increase to 82% and has continued to increase since. For 2018-19, we continued the same focused concentration as  we looked to revise curricula to make it more accessible to all students and to increase student engagement and  overall achievement. As a result of this concerted effort which began with inquiry work and centered on revision of  curriculum, our 2018 four year graduation rate was 92%. Furthermore June 2018 indicates a 78% passing rate in  Global History Regents results and 58% in ELA, for first time test takers with 32% of students scoring College Ready.  U.S. History passing rate for first time test takers was 87% for June 2018. Student credit accumulation (ten credits or  more) in the first year of high school dropped slightly from 86% to 83% with 65% of first year students in the lowest  third earning ten or more credits for the SY2017-2018. Statistics for the 2020 and 2021 cohorts indicated a declined as  discussed in Section 5A . These statistics illustrate the need to continue our focus on a commonly aligned across all  subjects, collaboratively planned and taught ninth grade curriculum as this has produced excellent results in previous  years. In summary, our focus on addressing the issues of declining credit accumulation has shown success However in  reviewing preliminary data for our ENL's and our 2020 and 2021 cohorts, we must diligently focus on addressing the  trends highlighted above.

Based in part on an analysis of SY2016-2017 Quality Review and having incorporated many of these suggestions in  SY2017-18 and having reviewed the SY2017 PPR, the principal and administrative team has identified these specific  targets for continued effective school leadership goals for SY2018-2019. Q.R. findings and PPR findings indicate that  “some teachers meet regularly to collaboratively plan lessons. Other teachers are not available due to scheduling  conflicts and other assignments.” Additionally, the agendas are rather vague and general. Furthermore, findings  indicate that there is no true teacher leadership in the team meetings and that there is no forum for “teacher leaders  to share team progress towards shared goals with school leaders.” The Q.R. highlighted two areas in particular for  improvement. These include:   1. Distributive Leadership   2. Effective Functioning of grade level and departmental teams.    Furthermore, the following information has been shared by teachers during monthly surveys conducted at  professional development conferences.    ● A common planning protocol for teachers has been developed, but is not always implemented in practice. and  needs to be better monitored by administration.   ● Protocols for data analysis and common assessment analysis not well defined.   ● Teacher walk-through and inter-visitations are evident but protocols must be improved and follow-up by teachers  actualized.   ● Data analysis, trends and referenced in 5a, 5b, and 5c of the CEP.   As a result of these observations, the following goal and action plan has been developed in order to improve overall  achievement at Belmont.

Belmont has a very strong and thorough system of electronic communication with families. From our website which is  updated regularly, to our efforts to sign parents up for pupil path, to our efforts at universal e-mail communication  and availability of online resources for students. Belmont however has always struggled with parental participation  despite these efforts. In past years the PA went into abeyance with neither a coterie of parent leaders stepping  forward, nor did the parents move to hold an election and reformulate the PA. Grade level/Activity Specific parent are  scheduled multiple times during the school year. In September 2017, a parent meeting for seniors was scheduled  which was attended by over eighty parents with their children. Following this successful meeting the principal  scheduled parent meetings and the P.A. held elections and was reconstituted for the first time since 2014-15. This  momentum will be carried over to 2018-19 as all meetings have been calendared and a mass mailing will go out  informing parents of the meeting schedule in advance. Although participation at Open School Parent Teacher  Conferences remains strong with over 40% of parents meeting with teachers at regularly scheduled open school  meetings, our parental involvement is lacking. In order to further accommodate as many parents at meetings as  possible, we see it as necessary to continue to expand the number and type of meetings as well as the manner in  which we communicate with parents. This includes online through the Belmont Prep. website, through electronic  messaging, and through Google Classroom platform and Skedula.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Belmont Preparatory High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Belmont Preparatory High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Parental Involvement and School Quality   Belmont's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:               actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association and Title I Parent Committee.

This program  is designed to enhance the literacy skills of our ENL students in activities by providing  supplemental activities that support language development in English with native language  instructional support. The goal of the program is to promote high academic achievement in  Science, Math and Social Studies as measured by subject area scholarship as well as Regents  passing/college readiness rates. The program is now comprised of three vital components  including a Saturday Regent's Exam Review program, two in-class supplemental arts and literacy  education programs, and an after-school mathematics, science and social studies tutorial  program.  The Saturday Regents Prep for ELL's, conducted in English incorporates native  language support, will specifically focus on promoting academic achievement for Science and  Social Studies, and will culminate in students taking Mock examinations in each content area.  The Saturday Regents program begins in Mid-November for 11th and 12th graders and runs up  to Januarty Regents Week. The program resumes in April, for 9th-12th graders, and continues  through Saturday June 15. The after school component focuses on intense academic  content  support in Math and Science for 9th graders, and Math or Social and ELA for 10th-12th  graders. Students' individualized programs are based on subject scholarship and any previous  Regents results. Historically this data has shown that our ENL's lag behind our native speaking  population in academic attainment in ELA, mathematics, and Social Studies.  As a result of a  review of the data, we have crafted a program which provides supplemental Saturday and after- school instruction in all core subjects. Additional supplies required for mathematics include  graphing calculators to be used in preparing students for common core mathematics  exams.  During the regular school day, we have incorporated a team teaching approach for  Living Environment in which our ESL teacher Mr. Torres  is paired with a science teacher in  order to incorporate ESL strategies into the science classroom.  We have also expanded this  program by incorporating a second literacy/special education teacher into the ESL 11th and 12th  grade classroom of Mr. Rowan.  The collaborating teacher will not only serve the ENL's with  IEP's, but will also incorporate additional differentiated instructional techniques to benefit the  remaining ENL's in the classroom.  In addition, 9th grade science classes partner with  the Salvadori Center for collaborative project-based STEM Education.

The  ENL/ELA team meetings are chaired and facilitated by our senior ENL/ELA teacher Mr. Scott  Rowan.  School wide professional development topics include:  Differentiated Instruction,  Student Engagement, Student Goal Setting, Teacher Goal Setting and implementation of the  Common Core Learning Standards through the crafting of aligned unit and lesson plans. As part  of their regular Collaborative Team meetings, ESL teachers meet with ELA teachers in order to  review strategies applicable to ENL’s.  School wide professional development is planned and  conducted by Principal Stephen J. Gumbs, NYS certification in teaching English to Second  Language Learners.  Our teachers have been provided professional development in ESL  strategies, methodologies and second language acquisition and instructional scaffolding  techniques based on teacher and student needs.  In addition our common preparation period has  served as forum for teachers to share best practices and to support individual teacher growth as  well as to build community. Our primary goal for professional development is to ensure that all  Faculty is engaged in professional discourse and learning. Our on-going two day per week PD  includes: Assessment, Lesson planning, Effective group work, Infusing Literacy across the  curriculum, The Principles of Learning, NY State Standards and daily instruction, Co-teaching,  Use of technology, Project Based Learning, Differentiated Instruction for ENL and EIP students,  Creating and Understanding Rubrics, Creating a positive text rich classroom environment.  Additionally, our ESL teacher, Mr. Jeremy Torres , will participate in training facilitated by the  AFSC. This PL series is an opportunity for or new ENL teacher, Mr. Torres, to (a) explore best  practices in engaging beginner ELLs in the instructional core as well as to (b) engage in planning  curriculum that is culturally responsive. Throughout the school year, Mr. Torrres will participate  in five full-day sessions ( Oct, Nov, Dec, Feb, March), that will allow him the time and space to  reflect on current practices, analyze relevant student work, explore resources, and discuss  strategies to address challenges relevant to their curriculum, participate in inter-visitations and  working groups,  collaborate, amplify and design rich curriculum to increase content area access  for ELLs. These sessions will empower Mr. Torres to turn key strategies and share materials  with the rest of the ENL/ELA team.    Our senior ENL/ELA teacher, Mr. Rowan, will participate in a monthly (November, December,  March, Aprilx2) Leadership Academy offered by the Superintendent's office in collaboration  with New Visions. His participation in this academy will empower him to impact change across  content areas, topics include: Creating systems and structures to set all students up for success in  higher level courses, applying content shifts to suit the needs of all learners, building school  leader capacity within content and pedagogy to provide effective feedback to teachers, among  others. Mr. Rowan will specifically assist staff in incorporating ENL techniques and strategies to  support Transitioning and Commanding 1 & 2 students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   BPHS organizational model is departmentalized. Our ENL students are programmed following a grade level  heterogeneous block for the 9th  and 10th grade. Upper grade students are grouped heterogeneously in mixed level  and grade ENL and ELA classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Beginning students receive over 540 minutes of instruction, intermediate students receive over 360 minutes of  instruction and advanced students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 Minutes of ELA per week. Content area  instruction is delivered by content area licensed teachers in the target language using ENL methodologies and techniques such  as QTELL and sheltered English. Our organizational model allows for common planning and collaborative inquiry periods  between ENL and content area teachers.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ENL students take all courses in English language which are aligned to the common core at the appropriate check points in  accordance with state regulations.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69          ENL students take native language courses which are aligned to the common core at the appropriate check points in  accordance with state regulations. All students identified based on home language survey are verified prior to standardized  test administration by testing coordinator in order to ensure proper evaluation.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    BPHS offers groups of ENL students different opportunities to accelerate language acquisition as well as their academic  progress and social development.  Our newcomers with fewer than than three years in the country and or at the beginning  level of language development and or SIFE status, are provided with the opportunity to attend a Saturday Academy Bi-literacy  Enrichment program, which takes place in the Spring. This intensive program focuses on content area native language  development reflective of Fall student performance data as well as reading, writing, oral and listening target language  development. ENL students receiving 4 or more years of service are offered academic intervention services in order to prepare  them for the rigor of the ELA Regents.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   During collaborative inquiry teams students look at periodic assessment data to isolate area of student need and develop  instructional strategies to target deficiencies and differentiate instruction trough the use of scaffolding, and amplification of  content. Our ninth grade students participate in a science literacy course with a push in science teacher. All ningth grade  students take Living Environment regardless of proficiency level the ENL teacher pushes into the Living Environment Lab to  provide support to Beginning level students. Our ENL teachers work collaboratively with ELA teachers to ensure  implementation of the Common Core Learning Standard for ELA in the ENL classroom. They work together to develop Unit  plans are designed to be engaging, with clarity of purpose and to promote higher order thinking skills in students, embedded in  Mike Schmoker's theory. ENL and ELA instructional models use the EMC series at each grade level, "Literature and the  Language Arts" and "The American Tradition", to develop their reading, writing, oral and listening skills through the use of read  aloud, shared-reading, independent reading time, sentence structure, reflective writing activities. In addition, our students  study the works of The Outsiders, Monster, Piri Thomas, Down these Mean Streets ; Ernesto Quinonez's Bodega Dreams and  Boricua, William Shakespeare, as well as a compilation of selected short stories, essays, poetry, letters and  speeches.  Instructional units focus on exploring essential questions through the lens of our school wide goal of developing  persuasive writing, and speaking skills rooted in a deep understanding and analysis of complex text.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Belmont Preparatory H.S.
