The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Brooklyn Collegiate is a high school with 257 students from grades 9 through 12. We are located in a low socio- economic community of Ocean Hills, Brownsville. 75% of our students meet the Title I requirements for free lunch.  Our student population is 83.27% Black, 13.45% Hispanic, 0.73% White, and 1.09% Asian. 6.91% of the student  population is English language learners and 26.18% special needs students. Boys account for 57.45% of the student  enrollment and girls account for 42.55%. The average attendance rate during the 2017-2018 school year was 86.2%.  We are a Renewal School therefore we receive additional resources and support from the State Department of  Education which helps to advance student achievement at the school. We are a community school, and serve a  diverse and largely minority student body, most of whom reside in the local area. Therefore, Brooklyn Collegiate is in  a position to provide a range of services to students and families to ensure their success. These opportunities range  from an on-site medical clinic staffed by the health department, opportunities for overage and under-credited  students to enroll in Young Adult Borough Center program. For students who need additional academic challenges,  we offer a partnership with College Now at Medgar Evers College, Early College at Monroe College, and the TRIO  program from Brooklyn College. Our key strategic collaboration is with Counseling in Schools, our CBO, which  arranges a number of services for our students and their families, from mental health referrals to internships.   The mission of Brooklyn Collegiate is to facilitate learning so that all students can master the challenges of a rigorous  curriculum that will guide them to college entrance and success. We are committed to establishing a strong school  community of families, teachers, and staff in support of our core mission. Our students will learn to think critically,  communicate effectively, and be open to new experiences and ideas as they become lifelong learners.   It is our collective belief that students learn best when they have trusted, caring, and supportive teachers and staff  who nurture and coach them to success. Classroom and overall school practices align with this belief in that teacher- student interactions, staff and student-student interactions are respectful and exhibit warmth and caring. Teachers  demonstrate a willingness to work with students individually during class time, during their prep time, lunch time,  before and after school.    Based on data from the 2017-2018 School Survey and the 2017-2018 School Quality snapshot our targeted  populations for the 2018-2019 school year are:   ● Title I low socio -economic students which make up 75% of our student population.    ● 26.18% SWD who are fully integrated using the ICT model.   ● Lowest third which make up 42.5% of the student population    During the 2017-2018 school year our overall rating for the school quality review was proficient. Our strengths and  major accomplishments were in the area of systems for improvement as it relates to tenet 1.3 - Leveraging Resources  and 4.1 - Teacher Support and Supervision. The areas that we have found most challenging are student attendance, 4  year graduation rate, credit accumulation, regents exam completion rate, college and career readiness and closing the   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      achievement gap. In all areas we are “Approaching the Target” with the exception of closing the achievement gap  which we are .1% below “Approaching Target”.       Our instructional focus for the 2018 – 2019 school year is:   Teachers with the support of administration and parents plan and implement core curriculum differentiated  rigorous content using the QTEL/pre-AP strategies to scaffold students’ ability to participate in various learning  activities, then students will be able to engage with multiple curriculum resources through reading, writing, and  analyitical discussions.    The leading indicators that we will focus on to accomplish our instructional focus are in the areas of Rigorous  Instruction (Tenet 1 & 3) and Effective Leadership (Tenet 2) :   ● Tenet 1.1 – Ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent common core and pre-AP aligned curricula in all subjects,  accessible for a variety of learners. Our objective is to develop lesson plans, academic tasks, and unit plans that result  in student work products, and end of unit tasks that consistently reflect rigorous higher order thinking skills across  grades and subjects.   ● Tenet 1.2 - Developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is  informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching. Pedagogy will be aligned to the curricula,  engaging, and meet the needs of all learners so that students produce meaningful work products. Based on classroom  observations and the School Quality Review, across classrooms the teaching strategies have not consistently provided  multiple entry points into the lesson for ELL’s and special needs students. Our objective is to develop teacher  pedagogy so that teachers employs strategies that encourage active student engagement and facilitate student led  discussions to promote higher-order thinking and rigorous participation.    ● Tenet 2.2 – On-going curricula-aligned assessment practices that inform instruction. Our objective is to strengthen  the instructional capacity of teachers to improve student achievement for all learners. Through teacher collaborations  , vertical teams will create assessments, rubrics, and grading policies, aligned with the school curricula. The on-going  modification of curricula will be based on the analysis of student work, teacher collaboration and data.      Based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Survey, 67% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that their professional  development experiences have been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short-term and unrelated. As a  result of this the following improvements were identified:   ● During the 2018-2019 school year teachers will be provided with targeted professional development to meet the  academic needs of all students including Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners.   ● There are collaborative team structures and supports that exist, that utilize an inquiry approach that promotes  shared leadership and focus on student learning. All teachers have common planning time built into their schedule for  opportunities o engage in structured inquiry based professional collaborations where they use a looking at student  work protocol.   ● Teachers efficacy in meeting CCLS will increase with the use of ENGAGENY and New Visions curriculum which  emphasize instructional practices with respect to time and depth. Promotion of school goals and the implementation  of Common Core Learning Standards strengthen the instructional capacity of teachers and student progress through  inquiry work.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13         We chose a school based option for extended learning, such that ELT opportunities are integrated into a nine-period  day, 3 days a week. This is a programming challenge, but does allow for students to maximize their credit-earning  opportunities. Nearly all ELT programs are credit-bearing. Over-credited seniors can opt for a "Supervised Study" ELT,  which embeds assistance from our college counselor around college applications.

Administration and teachers support and facilitate the quality implementation of rigorous and coherent curricula  appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards ( CCLS ). We are implementing curricula, units of study,  lesson plans and academic tasks that are content standards aligned, data driven, and address the student achievement  needs of our diverse learners. Our goal is to continue to develop a school culture in which data from teacher designed  assessment tools and state designed assessments are consistently used to make decisions regarding student needs. We  want to continue to build teacher capacity so that they can make adjustments to curriculum and instructional practices  based on the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data. Ultimately, we feel that a data driven culture will lead to  strategic action-planning that informs instruction and results in greater student achievement.    To further develop in tenet 3 we will:   ● Continue to provide Teacher Teams with weekly scheduled collaboration and planning time to analyze student data  and document needed instructional adjustments in teacher practice.   ● Continue to scheduled inter-visitations for all teachers with emphasis on building teacher capacity.   ● Continue to develop uniform methods to provide school-wide feedback regarding the results of student data analysis,  and instructional adjustments in teacher practices.   ● Continue to modify and revise curricula, lesson plans, units of study, and academic tasks.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17      ● Administratively continue to monitor teacher implementation of instructional adjustments in teacher practice through  formal and informal observations.

Listed below are the findings from  the senior Cohort.     23 students have passed all 5 regents    4 students have passed four regents    9 students have passed three regents    4 students have passed two regents    11 students have passed one regents      Total of 64 students, Cohort 2019 data is not as strong as 2018 data.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction       Mission Statement       The mission of Brooklyn Collegiate os to facilitate learning so that all students can master the challenges of rigorous  curriculum that will guide them to college entrance and success. We are committed to establishing a strong school  community of families, teachers, and staff in support of our core mission. Our students will lean to think critically,  communicate effectively, and be open to new experiences and ideas as they become life long learners.

Brooklyn Collegiate was accepted into the  Pre-Ap cohort for 2018-2019. Freshmen will have Pre-AP courses in World History , Biology, English and Algebra. We will  continue to utilize the NYC Framework for Social Studies and the NYS Framework for Science, NYS Health curriculum  and teacher made curriculum for the various electives including PE. Teachers will create and execute lessons using our  school-wide lesson plan template that deliberately design lesson that offer multiple access points for all learners.    ● AP courses will be provided to Juniors and Seniors in the areas of English Literature, World History, Calculus, Statistics  and Biology. College Now courses with Medger Evers College will be offered to Juniors and Seniors. Online support  programs include Study Island, Plato, IXL, Worldly Wise 3000, Rosetta Stone, and Imagine Math. Students will  participate in the AP Capstone program beginning in their freshman year with a Freshman Seminar course.   ● The College Starter Program will be implemented during the summer and fall to provide Juniors and Seniors with  college and career readiness training as it applies to the college application process including personal statements and  financial aid applications (FAFSA).   ● Instructional shifts will be evident by inquiry based instruction where students make claims and conjectures and  develop hypotheses grounded in evidence. Teachers will conduct regular and varied assessments throughout the lesson  and unit of study to meet strategic benchmarks and determine mastery of content.      Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during after-school and/or  summer programming is provided in collaboration with community partners. Students will have the opportunity to  shore up skills in Math and literacy. Students will also be a part of the student government, yearbook, book club,  speech, Regents Prep, dance, drum line, computer animation, basketball, barbering, fitness, community service,  leadership, cheer leading, art club, Academics in Motion, make up and accelerated classes.       Consistency will be supported through Data Wise/ strategic inquiry work in vertical and horizontal teams. Findings from  the inquiry process will be used to develop and implement relevant learning activities and tasks in the classrooms.  Faculty will be provided with support through peer coaching and feedback from low inference observations.      Teacher analysis of student performance data on uniform instructional unit assessments, mid semester assessments,  and end of semester assessments, will be used to revise curricula accordingly. The data will be shared during common  planning with teacher groups. The administration will support vertical and horizontal teams by developing strategies to  address concerns.   Other data that will be used to measure student growth will include, but not be limited to previous Regents scores, SAT  scores, mid unit assessments, and teacher narratives that are captured in Skedula, an online grading system. The  teacher in conjunction with the instructional team will meet and discuss progress, interventions, and curricular  revisions. Assessments will be used to track interventions more specifically with Cohort U, 2019. Students will be  assigned interventions based on need and interventions will be tracked by assessments every other week by  administration and guidance counselors to ensure students are on track to graduate. Data will be analyzed to ensure  the interventions are working.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19               What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   The Springboard curriculum, which is fully aligned with CCLS, is used in the ELA classrooms. In math we use EngageNY  and in the science and social studies classrooms we use the New Visions curriculum. The pre-AP curriculum in core  classes wil be implemented beginning fall 2018. Teachers will receive training and support from College Board,  throughout the year. These curricula provide activities that can be adapted to address the needs of our diverse learning  community. Pre-AP strategies used in the Springboard curriculum serve as the basis of our school-wide professional  development. These strategies give students the opportunity to access multiple content using familiar skills and  strategies. The teacher horizontal and vertical teams meet on a weekly basis to assess student need. In addition, the  DATAWise protocol will be implemented to conduct inquiry of student performance on common assessments, state  exams, and teacher designed application activities.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  At Brooklyn Collegiate, in addition to State suggested course offerings, students will have opportunities to take AP  classes such as AP Seminar, AP Literature, AP World History, AP American History, AP Statistics, and AP Calculus.  Students seeking additional academic challenges can do so through the College Now program at Medgar Evers.  Beginning Fall 2018, Brooklyn Collegiate will implement the pre-AP curriculum to freshman. This will increase advance  placement participation as well as regents completion rate and the 4 - year graduation rate.    Students who are not on track will be offered Regents preparatory courses. The Rewards reading program will be  implemented to support students who are reading below grade level. Students entering grade 9 performing at a level 2  or below will be programmed for an additional skills based Math course (Imagine Learning) and an academic  reading/writing course.         What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   Teachers will employ the 5-30-10 model in an effort to compartmentalize instruction for all students. All lessons will  have an entry assignment to gauge students pre-requisite knowledge of the content. There will be a 10 minute  read/write/discussion task in which the students will discover/model/learn a skill or strategy. Students will be given the  opportunity to try out the skill or strategy in pairs or groups after which they will spend a maximum of 10 minutes  practicing that skill or strategy independently and clarify misunderstandings. At the end of every lesson there will be a  share-out and an exit ticket which will be used to assess student mastery. Each lesson must contain at least three checks  for understanding. Teachers will spend time reflecting on lessons as part of our lesson study component of professional  development.   This model will allow students to practice and develop skills and strategies that are necessary for academic success. The  implementation of this model in all classrooms supports the develop of critical and analytical thinkers and life long  learners.         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  When planning their lessons teachers will utilize a rich library of tools, resources, and supports lets teachers adapt their  instruction for all students including SWDs and ELLS. Teachers will also use supplemental ELL materials, routines for  teaching foundational skills, and alternative assignments for struggling students.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          20      Assessments will include open ended questions that get students writing, student reflections, response cards, think- pair-share, one question quiz, Socratic seminar, analogy prompts, and peer instruction.   The teacher or paraprofessional will conduct small group instruction with students identified as needing additional  assistance after the guided practice. Teachers will hold over the shoulder conferences, making note of student progress  during independent practice time. During these conferences, teachers will suggest improvement strategies for students.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Teachers will create and analyze assessments during vertical and horizontal teams. At the beginning of each  instructional unit, teacher teams will design pre-assessments. The student data from these assessment will be used to  create lessons and strategies to fill the gaps in students' knowledge and improve their understanding of the current  concept being taught. The data from the daily assessments and the mid-unit assessments will be used by the horizontal  teams to determine effective instructional strategies. The data from the post-assessments will be used in the DATA wise  inquiry process to determine vertical team instructional strategies to improve student learning outcomes.

Tenet 5 is an area that Brooklyn Collegiate does well. Administration is continually aligning and re-aligning the use of  resources to support the schools’ instructional goals and foster partnerships with other organizations to support and  sustain social and emotional development. Long standing partnerships have been established with:   - Counseling In Schools ( CIS ) will provide counseling and referrals for students that need socio -emotional support. They  will also focus on students that are chronically absent/ late or at risk for dropping out of school. Counseling will be  conducted with individuals as well as in groups.   - Sports and Arts In Schools Foundation ( SASF ) to provide sports, performing arts, leadership, community outreach,  cooking, and a drum-line.    - Academics In Motion (AIM) a mentoring program that provides academic enrichment, SAT, ACT and regents prep, and  social and emotional development.   To help facilitate initiatives and programs for the 2018-2019 school year, CIS will employ Master's level clinicians to  provide direct service to students, work with families, support school staff and make links to outside referrals for health,  mental health, academic and recreation programs, as needed. Our clinicians are experienced in approaching the work  through a whole child model, assessing intrapersonal and interpersonal needs that include environmental factors.  Services that would be provided based on assessment would include:   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          26      ● Individual Counseling: one on one meetings with students to discuss areas of needed development including social,  emotional, behavioral, academic and relational skills   ● Group Counseling: general support or work around a common theme with a small group of student   ● Family Support: individual meetings, family meetings, concrete needs assessment, home visits, parent events and  workshops   ● School Staff/Teacher Professional Development: in-class teacher support, experiential workshops addressing topics  such as understanding child development, emotional/social awareness, burnout (VT) prevention, care for the caregiver   ● Whole school crisis intervention: implementing or supporting individual incident intervention, organizing/supporting  school- based crisis team, implementation of crisis response structures   ● Resource Coordination: implementation and support of school-wide initiatives, participation in the school leadership  team, PPT meetings, attendance meetings, stake- holder meetings, town hall initiatives, neighborhood fairs, research  and identification of community resources, assistance with family access to resources    Extended Learning Time- Extended Learning Time programs conducted by CIS aim to engage children in a variety of  courses and activities that support learning and expand their areas of interest while maintaining a focus on self-esteem  and positive peer relationships. Academically focused ELT programs may include tutoring, SAT Prep, Regents Prep/  Review, etc. Enrichment programs may include theater, art, dance, martial arts, yoga, robotics, etc.   A review of the 2017-2018 School Environmental Survey students, staff and parents felt safe inside the school however,  safety outside of the school building was the main concern of administration, students, and parents.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?  Summative Vision for Supportive Environment    Brooklyn Collegiate is a school that promotes a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff,  students, and families, and provides supports to achieve those expectations. The school supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults. As per the 2017-2018 School Environmental Survey students, parents, and staff  feel that the school is safe . They feel academically as well as emotionally supported.   Currently we have four partnerships: Counseling In Schools (CIS) , Single Shepherd, The New York Edge, and Academics  In Motion (AIM). All four provide services and activities that support the social and emotional growth and health of our  students.    CIS programs are staffed and supervised by advanced level counselors with extensive experience in child and    family counseling. Their programs are custom-designed to meet the unique needs of each community. Some    of the issues their core counseling services address our Attendance Improvement/ Dropout Prevention,    Violence Prevention, Homelessness, Trauma and Social/Emotional Literacy. They provide both individual and    group counseling.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          27         Individual counseling offers students an opportunity to develop caring relationships with responsible adults who    are specially trained to address their social and emotional needs. Individual counseling provides students with    an opportunity to:   - discuss and establish goals   - explore and learn about the obstacles that may be negatively affecting their social, emotional and academic  development   - create problem-solving strategies that enable them to successfully achieve academically in school   - increase their self-confidence   - have a greater understanding of the behavioral choices they are making   - gain the desire to set and achieve personal goals and   - gain a greater capacity to integrate into a school/learning environment      Groups counseling focuses on general support around a common theme such as:   - anger management    - bereavement   - gender-based issues    - life transitions   - managing family stress      The New York Edge programs provide sports, performing arts, leadership, community outreach, basketball, cheer- leading, Chess club, and a drum- line.       AIM and Single Shepherd programs provide mentoring, academic enrichment, SAT, ACT and regents prep, to support  academic, and social and emotional development.      Student voice and leadership is supported through the Student Government and student members on the    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          28      School Leadership Team. The Principal also promotes an open door policy in which staff, students, and    parents are encouraged to meet and speak with the Principal on an as needed basis. Through the therapeutic  relationships between counselors and students CBOs address student voice and leadership by promoting positive youth  development and student advocacy. CIS counselors work to help students advocate for themselves regarding the  questions, concerns and desires in seeing change in the school community both on an individual basis and through the  use of student focus groups. The implementation of town hall meetings will provide a forum for student voice and input.  CIS will work collaboratively with the school to improve school culture by meeting student’s basic psychological needs  that include autonomy, a sense of belonging, competence and recognition of effort and student leadership  development. Town hall style meetings will be organized and led by students. Students will receive the support they  need to present topics of relevance to their fellow students in a manner which will foster dialogue and increase the  involvement of the student body at large. This process will open a critical avenue of expression for student needs.   The social-emotional learning framework that Brooklyn Collegiate will adopted is PBIS , Positive Behavior Intervention  System and TCIS, Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools to reduce suspensions and increase academic performance,  improve safety, decrease problem behavior, and establish a positive school culture. Through both frameworks we will  develop a school culture and school environment that increases teaching and learning for all students. Using these  frameworks we will:   Implement PBIS practices and strategies school-wide.      Use a problem‐ solving approach to difficult behavior.    Examining and improving the entire school climate.     Create a TCIS Team that consists of the CBOs , Administration, Teachers, Guidance, Parent Coordinator, Family   Worker, and Family Worker.     Use data to examine the reasons behaviors are occurring       Employ fair and consistent discipline practices    Implement changes and interventions designed to address the identified needs.    During the 2017-2018 school year we had 10 Principal suspensions in comparison to 30 in the 2016-2017 school year.  For the 2016-2017 school year we had 6 Superintendent suspensions in comparison to 8 during the 2017- 2018 school  year. We will use PBIS, TCIS, and our partnerships with the CBOs to build on existing strengths and to analyze suspension  data to determine the types of infractions and to find solutions/alternatives to suspension.

Together the school and CBO will partner to host workshops, a variety of cultural activities for parents and students.  With support from the CBOs, teachers and staff will implement a College Board based Advisory curriculum and a College  Access for All curriculum. The CBOs, teachers and staff will also host a series of workshops geared at demystifying the  high school and college process, providing workplace skills, and supports for civil service exam preparation.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices  and Decisions)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 4 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized   around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs.   4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards   (CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students.   4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning   environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths  and needs of all students.   4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by   using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures,  and progress monitoring).

Although we were well-developed in 4.1 and proficient in 4.2 for the 2017-2018 school Quality Review. The areas  requiring improvement to continue to grow in are: implementation of pre-AP strategies and creating a different learning  environment that is tailored to the strengths and needs of all students including ELLs , SWDs , over-aged under credited  students, and the lowest third . Our focus in this area will be on organizing instruction and lesson planning to provide:   • Multiple entry points into each lesson to accommodate the needs of ELL’s SWD’s and our lowest third..   • Lesson plans, unit plans and academic tasks that meet the needs of all students   • Teacher team planning that focuses on instructional shifts, curriculum and CCLS alignment, and student    progress.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers    How is the school organized to promote teacher collaboration?    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Currently teachers have common planning periods built into their weekly schedule. We want to continue to build on  strategic action-planning that informs instruction and results in greater student engagement and achievement. In the  2018 - 2019 school year:   ● Teacher Teams have weekly scheduled collaboration and planning time to analyze student data and document needed  instructional adjustments in teacher practice.   ● School leadership has scheduled inter-visitation for all teachers that focus on building teacher capacity.   We want to develop a uniform method to provide feedback school-wide regarding the results of student data analysis,  and instructional adjustments in teacher practices.      What does teaching and learning look like? What underlying principles would influence the creation of units and  lesson plans? Do teachers work on units and lessons in teams?    The delivery of lessons and curriculum will involve learning that promotes rigor through:    - Student groupings that promote active engagement and participation by all students   - Lessons that promote Higher order thinking and reasoning skills using DOK (Depth of Knowledge Stems) and Hess’  Matrix   How are teachers providing opportunities for to deepen learning for higher achieving students?    ● Differentiation will be incorporated in the lesson plans so that the tasks, assignment, and units of study include more  advanced levels for higher achieving students.   ● Higher achieving students will be enrolled in AP classes and College Now courses.      What system do teachers use to ensure that every child is safe in their class?    ● Teachers promote positive classroom interactions between teacher and students and among students through posted  classroom rules, character development/respect for all lessons, and established classroom routines.    ● The school promotes respect, caring, and sensitivity among students as individuals through:    - Implementation of a student survey to establish knowledge of individual students’ interests and needs.    - Incorporating opportunities for students to share their heritage in lessons, cultural events, and participation in  community events.    - Creating a classroom culture in which the teacher and students use courtesies such as “please”, “thank you”, and  excuse me whenever appropriate as defined in posted classroom rules and teacher guided discussions.   ● School uniform policy, classroom code of conduct, and school rules will be strictly enforced by administration,  teachers, dean and all staff to promote a safe environment    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● Teachers stand at their doors at the end of class and monitor the hallway during change of classes.   ● Teachers inform Dean and Administration of any adverse conversations or conflicts.      What data should teachers review regularly to ensure they plan for individual student needs? Should the teachers  review student work collaboratively in teams?    ● Regularly teachers should review student attendance, student performance on homework, class assignments, teacher-  made test, unit tests, quizzes, and IEPs.   ● Student work should be reviewed collaboratively by teacher teams on a weekly basis to identify instructional shifts,  and provide feedback to colleagues using an inquiry based protocol (DATAWISE).      How do you intend to use community educators / partners to support a collaborative teaching approach?    In support of our work with students to address their needs, Counseling in Schools and Single Shepherd staff will engage  in individual teacher trainings throughout the school year. Individual teacher training is provided through the integration  of a counselor into the classroom during pre-arranged class periods. Teachers will meet vertically and horizontally twice  a week. Counselors will attend two of the meetings to develop ways to support students in the classroom.           How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  The School Instructional Cabinet will conduct weekly meetings to discuss teacher team concerns around student  engagement and performance. The Cabinet will collaborate to determine problem solving strategies needed to improve  teacher practices and student performance. These will be shared during the weekly vertical and horizontal team  meetings as well as the weekly staff professional development.         How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teachers will engage in strategic inquiry around student work. Using the DATA wise protocol, findings from the inquiry  work will be used to create a bank of tools and strategies to address student needs. The inquiry work done through this  process will be ongoing.         How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teachers will engage in strategic inquiry around student work in their vertical teams. Findings from these teams will be  used to inform the inquiry process in the horizontal teams. Both teams will develop tools and strategies to address  student needs. Teachers will employs these strategies across grades and content areas in order to increase students  mastery via continuous practice/participation.     What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Data Reviewed   Intent   Regents Data   Improve regents passing rate   Classroom assessment  data   Improve teacher practice   IEPs   Improve appropriate scaffolding techniques      Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Collaborative Teachers.

As a result of the 2017-2018 Quality Review the Principal was considered and rated as an effective school leader by the  Quality Reviewer and most of the staff . The area identified as needing improvement was professional development.  67% of the teachers agreed that overall their professional development experience was sustained and included enough  time to try and evaluate new ideas. In 2018-2019 teachers will be provided with professional development designed to  improve teacher understanding of how to devise lessons so the NYS Next Generation standards are being addressed.  Additionally, the Principal will implement measures to reinforce and build more trust between the school leaders,  teachers and students.           Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?

How will the Principal  ensure the CBO partnership is strong? How will the CBO partners collaborate with school staff to ensure that  students’ academic and social-emotional needs are being met?    The principal will ensure the vision and mission are shared with the entire school community through a variety of  communications, meetings, phone master calls with the principal’s voice, letters and flyers sent out. The principal and  the CBO site director will meet on a daily basis and remain in constant communication with evidence based discussions.  CBO partners and teachers, in conjunction with students, will develop academic and social emotional SMART goals for  each student and will regularly monitor the progress and performance with weekly conferences with the student in  Advisory.      To ensure that student’s academic needs are being met, CIS will collaborate with school stakeholders to review existing  programming for expanded learning and enrichment activities. We will work together to develop a well-rounded plan  that integrates the school day with enrichment youth development activities and assess any gaps in service. For a  community school model to be successful, it is imperative that students see extended learning time and youth  development enrichment activities as a natural extension of the day and not a separate service. By establishing an  environment that is supportive and engaging, students will want to remain in their community through the evening,  participating in project based experiences that enhance their feelings of mastery and belonging.       To ensure that student’s social-emotional needs are being met, CIS will provide direct clinical practice and linkage to  resources in collaboration with DOE’s Office of School Health ( OSH ) and Division of Mental Hygiene ( MHY ). This will  ensure full wrap around services to the school community. CIS staff will work closely with any existing on-site mental  health programs to support the referral of individually targeted interventions while assessing the overall school needs  for selective and universal interventions, including:   Individual Counseling: 1:1 sessions to address social, emotional, behavioral, academic and relational skills       Group Counseling: general support with small groups of students.     Family Support: individual meetings, family meetings, concrete needs assessment, home visits, parent events  and workshops.  School Community Professional Development: in-class teacher support, workshops including child development,  emotional/social awareness, care for the caregiver.        Crisis/Trauma Response: Supporting individual incident intervention, creating crisis team roles and structures,   Trauma-sensitive practices.      What kind of evidence based systems would a school leader put in place to ensure that the school and individuals  continues to improve? What kind of supports? Who would he/she collaborate with? What would those collaborations  look like?    Teachers will use an Skedula and/or STARS to track and monitor student progress academically and social emotionally.  Each at risk student will be assigned a CBO advisor who will meet with the student and each other to discuss progress  and to plan further intervention strategies weekly. The school leader and administrative team will use the ADVANCE  system to track and monitor teacher performance. Teachers will be monitored regularly and systematically through  observations and inquiry team work.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          48   How would the leader organize student and teacher programs to ensure students’ needs are met?

How would he/she ensure that teachers  are provided accurate, timely, and actionable feedback coupled with the support to implement the feedback?    The School Leader and the administrative team will use the ADVANCE system to target critical individual and school- wide practices. We will use the Skedula to monitor and support all aspects of family engagement.      How will the school support a shared accountability? What systems will be developed to share academic, behavior,  Social Emotional Learning ( SEL ), and attendance data with partners so that strategies can be created and assessed to  support growth?    CIS and other necessary CBO partners will be expected to take an active role in the school in order to inform their best  practices and adjust programming as needed. They will be expected to attend and participating in weekly attendance  meetings, grade team meetings, common planning meetings etc. Academic and behavioral data will be reviewed and  shared with the CBOs . CBO partners will sign confidentiality clauses to enable them to share student data.       What and how will the leader delegate to assistant principals and the community school director?    The Principal will delegate during schedule cabinet meetings and meetings with the Community School Director. The  nature of the delegation will depend on the program requirements/needs, the issue(s) at hand, and the needs of  students, parents, and staff.      On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Teacher Evaluation and parent engagement      What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   School-wide professional development. Evidence of the effectiveness of our PD will be seen in student work product, in  classroom observations, and during inquiry team work.                      What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Vertical and horizontal teams will be teacher led. Using the Data Wise protocol teachers will engage in inquiry cycles of  at least 6 weeks in length, identifying targeted skills and standards needed to be addressed.

Brooklyn Collegiate administration and teachers are very effective in tenet 6. This is an area that the school does well.  Administration is continually aligning and re-aligning the use of resources to support the schools’ instructional goals and  foster partnerships with parents and other organizations to support and sustain academic and social and emotional  development. Long standing partnerships have been established with:   - Counseling In Schools ( CIS ) provides individual, group and family counseling and referrals for socio -emotional  development and support.    - The Edge New York provides intramural and extra-curricular activities in sports, the performing arts, leadership,  community outreach, cooking, and a drum-line.    - Academics In Motion (AIM) is a mentoring program that provides academic enrichment, SAT, ACT and regents prep,  mentoring, and social and emotional development.      Parents are actively involved in the school culture as evident by their responses in the 2017-2018 School Environmental  Survey and their participation in the Parent Teacher Association, the School Leadership Team, and their presence at  school events and parent teacher conferences. Brooklyn Collegiate communicates with parents through mailings, a  phone master system, SKEDULA program, the PTA , and the SLT team. .   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          55      A review of the 2017-2018 School Environmental Survey students, staff and parents felt safe inside the school however,  safety outside of the school building was the main concern of administration, students, and parents.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school?   Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties    Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community? What support will school safety officers and all staff be given to help create a welcoming environment?    A strong and collaborative parent and community engagement model is integral for the success of a community school.  Providing concrete and consistent support to parents and families while connecting them to resources in their  community is vital to enhancing the resiliency of students. Increasing both parent and community participation is an  investment in the community school model which will result in the community school becoming a true community hub  for a variety of academic, social- emotional, employment, training and community related needs. The CBO becomes a  bridge between families and available services. Families will be invited into the school as stakeholders in their child’s  education. Families will be and be given the opportunity to identify services, receive trainings and workshops that will  best support them in their role as caregiver and as vital members of the school community.       To successfully approach parents to become more engaged, CIS will ensure that the Community school model and its  development is well explained and accurately communicated to all parents immediately upon the start of the  partnership. On-going outreach to parents will be conducted to get to know students’ families on a more individual  basis. These relationships and the knowledge gained from them, will become the basis for establishing increased parent  engagement and participation      A parent welcoming committee will be created to decorate the lobby, to welcome visitors and to escort visitors to the  main office. School Safety Agents and the main office staff will welcome parents with courtesy and kindness. The CBO  will procure “Customer Service” training for all staff. A customer service survey will be created and given to visitors to  keep on top of issues and concerns.      How does the school provide support to families so that they understand and can take an active role in what their  child is learning?    Support is provided for families so that they are actively involved in their children(s) learning through:    - Parent-teacher conferences   - Parent outreach every Tuesday by teachers    - interim positive phone calls,    - SKEDULA , the on-line grading system   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          56      - School Messenger Service to relay school events and important information vis text and automated phone calls   - School website   - Communication via e-mail and letters    - PSA meetings   - SLT meetings   - Workshops   - Vertical Team meetings   -Horizontal Team meetings      How would the school engage the community and families? How would they ensure that teachers are able to learn  from families about the children being taught?    As parents begin to identify needs that have a common connection to other parents of students in the school, CIS will  work to expand the circle of influence and will look to create opportunities and linkages both in the school and within  the community. Encouraging and supporting parents, teachers and community members to share their views and ideas  so that they have the ability to influence what happens at the school will enrich students’ educational experiences and  help to ensure the school’s responsiveness to local community needs. Methods for capturing feedback from key  stakeholders in the community school model, i.e. parents, teachers and community partners, include the use of formal  and informal consultations, surveys, focus groups and public meetings/events.   These methods must be conducted regularly to ensure sustained involvement from parents as student enrollment  changes from year to year. Formal consultations will be conducted to elicit parents’, teachers’ and community member’s  views. This provides a systematic way of collecting and measuring feedback which makes it easier to give those views  prominence and ensure that they are heard and taken into account as part of the school’s decision-making process.      How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success? Will there be dedicated space for  families?    Room 117 will be dedicated to families. By working in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, outreach will be  provided to all families to increase parent engagement and investment in the Community School model. CIS will support  and encourage increased parent participation in school forums and meetings to ensure a strong voice on behalf of  parents and families as presented in the development of the Community School model to support student success. As  mentioned above, continued outreach will be conducted to get to know students’ families on a more individual basis.  These relationships and the knowledge gained from them, will become the basis for establishing increased parent  engagement and participation. As parents begin to identify needs that have a common connection to other parents of  students in the school, CIS will work to expand the circle of influence and will look to create opportunities and linkages  both in the school and within the community.       What adult education offerings can your school community provide to families?    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Families will be provided with a survey to gauge and assess their needs and areas of interest. Based on the data  collected from these surveys, CIS will work collaboratively with the school and community organizations to offer  workshops and classes for parents. The support that these services provide will also lay the ground work for a trusting  and mutual partnership between parents/guardians and the larger school community. Increased parent engagement  will be fostered through opportunities made available by community partners.   Programs and workshops will be implemented by the CBO and Brooklyn Collegiate:   - Leadership and potential employment opportunities within the school and community   - Workforce and technology trainings   - Advocacy and parenting workshops,    - ELL classes for parents,    - Financial planning    - Literacy classes   - Legal assistance,    - Computer Skills Program    - Initiatives to Involve more fathers and male role models in our school   - Parenting Skills/Family Support Resources   - Understanding and participation in instructional initiatives   - Workshop on Title 1 Laws and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 2001   - School-based Support services   - Effective Parent Involvement activities that improve student academic achievement and school performance.    - New Parents and Non-English speaking parents outreach activities.   How would families be able to access and understand student data and progress?    Families will be able to access and understand student data through:   - SKEDULA on-line grading program    - Parent Teacher conferences   - Parent workshops         Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?

How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school  governance structures?  Through the parent coordinator parents will be encouraged to join SLT and PTA. Parents will be survey during the first  days of school and at our first Welcome Back to School Night as to their preferred mode of communication. The results  of the survey will be used to maximize home/school communication. Additionally, we will implement a communication  system whereby each staff member will be responsible for contacting the homes of 15 to 20 students to inform them of  school events.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the  Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the  Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional  growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, Administration in collaboration with the CBO and teachers will implement programs that provide  opportunities for all students to participate in additional instruction, enrichment activities, and social-emotional  development during and after-school and/or summer programs .         Part 2 – ELT Program Type   Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students,  including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT.  Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.  The ELT hour has been included in the student schedules. All students will receive additional supports via remediation  or enrichment. Remediation will take the form of Rewards, Study Island, Ivy Key Regents Prep Tutoring Program, and  Regents prep. Enrichment will take the form of AP and College Now courses.        Part 3 – ELT Program Description   Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school.   Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program:  How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make  learning relevant and engaging?    How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day?     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as   to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of  graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and   language mandates are met during ELT?     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          72        Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the   supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to   school faculty and community partner staff?     What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners?    How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement?    How will effective outreach be conducted to families?    How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage   participation?   We have designed the ELT program to be targeted to the needs, skills and interests of all students in the building.  Based on data from the incoming 9 th graders, students will receive an extra hour of ELA or Math so that students will  have a two period Math or ELA period a day. Data will be analyzed based on attendance, progress toward graduation,  area of need and interests. The extra hour will consist of the following but not limited to: SAT prep, College Now,  PLATO, Algebra prep, English prep, Global History prep, Speech, Calculus prep, U.S History prep, and Living  Environment prep. The CBO will provide additional supports such as push in supports, internship program, and  remediation.    Our ELT hour is now woven within our school day. Teachers have the option of working a 1 to 8 or 2 to 9 schedule.   How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that  make learning relevant and engaging?    Administration will provide teachers with professional development in which they will learn new strategies to help  them create lesson plans and present lessons that integrate academics, enrichment and skill development through  hands-on experiences that make learning relevant and engaging.    How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day?    CIS will work collaboratively with the school to implement an ELT schedule that best fits within the school schedule.  ELT will occur within the school day during 9th period on student schedules. The ELT and enrichment courses will be  viewed as any other class with class attendance viewed as expected and mandatory. Through the needs and asset  assessment, CIS will identify internal human resources before hiring external resources by surveying and interviewing  teachers to identify areas of interest they may have in providing some of the ELT and enrichment activities in order to  provide instructional consistency for the students. For example, a DOE Math teacher may have experience and  interest in co-facilitating a boys group or Rites of Passage Group with a CIS Counselor in addition to teaching his  regular math courses.    How will CBO staff, Administration, and the school’s teachers offer a range of activities that capture student  interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for  retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of graduation.    CIS will survey the students of Brooklyn Collegiate to obtain their areas of interest prior to scheduling enrichment  activities. The data findings from the surveys will be used to inform the activities offered to the students. Enrichment  activities will be developed to include related field trips, guest speakers, and other incentives to maximize student  interest and attendance. Depending on the variety of activities selected by the students, most enrichment activities  can be showcased in a culminating end of year event allowing students to showcase their work and dedication to the  enrichment activity throughout the year. By captivating student interests to inform activity offerings scheduled during  or at the end of the school day, there will be an increase in students’ overall attendance by providing them with an  incentive to attend school for the day in order to participate in these courses. This will then impact a reduction in  grade retention and increase the likelihood of graduation.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          73      How will CBO staff, Administration, and the school’s teachers actively address the unique learning needs and  interests of all types of students, especially those who may benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in  the traditional classroom setting.    CIS counselors ans Single Shepherd staff will work collaboratively with the teachers of the ELT courses to help identify  students with unique learning needs and work collaboratively with both the teacher and student to design a plan to  address those needs to maximize the student’s ability to excel in that class. Counselors may also push in to ELT  classrooms that need additional co-facilitation to address student needs. Student interest surveys provided at the  beginning of the school year will aim to capture student interests including interests not offered in a traditional school  setting. Programming will be created to incorporate the largest areas of interest within the student body. Program  evaluation and student attendance will be monitored regularly to make adjustments where necessary.    What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students?    We have added the following AP classes to our college and career preparatory course index:      * Computer A   * Literature   * Speech   * Music   *World History   *Biology   *Statistics   *Calculus   *Seminar   *American History      How will CBO staff, Administration, and the school’s teachers create a program that contains components designed  to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including opportunities for enrichment programs  such as in music and art.    CIS , in collaboration with the school, will offer a range of ELT courses to students aimed at addressing their most  significant academic needs. Teachers and Administration have identified the need for ELT offerings to include  homework help, test-taking and study skills, SAT and Regents Prep, and tutoring. CIS Counselors will work  collaboratively with teachers to offer social emotional support and activities in the ELT classroom setting to promote  social-emotional learning. Enrichment activities will also promote social emotional learning. CIS Counselors will work  with the activity instructors to increase their social-emotional vocabulary and utilize youth development approaches   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          74      in addition to tying all enrichment activities to academic instruction in the classroom. Art and music programs will be  provided by SASF .   How will CBO staff and school Administration ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the  program will be delivered under the supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.    Brooklyn Collegiate will fill core academic subject courses with NYS certified teachers from Brooklyn Collegiate. Any  teaching staff hired outside of Brooklyn Collegiate staff will be required to provide the necessary DOE required  credentials. All candidates will participate in a rigorous interview process with CIS including a DOE background check,  fingerprinting, reference checks and license and accreditation checks prior to their appointment within a position at a  school.   How will community educators receive professional development? Are there plans to provide joint PD to school  faculty and community partner staff?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          87      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          88      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Collegiate, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Brooklyn Collegiate will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          89      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The initial screening of possible ELLs occurs during the enrollment of new admits (including transfer students who transfers or  list notices),  to 23K493. The Pupil Personnel Staff, administers the HLIS. If the HLIS indicate a language other than English (or  the parent indicates that the student has been out of the New York state schools system for more than 2 years or never  before), then the Pupil Personnel Staff, notifies the ELL teacher. The ELL teacher conducts an informal interview with the  parent in their native language and or English. The formal initial assessment is conduct by the ELL teacher and/or the Test  Coordinator. The NYSIITELL is administered within 10 days of enrollment. The teacher uses the State designated level of  proficiency on the NYSIITELL to determine if the student is eligible for either Freestanding ELL, Transitional Bilingual Education  or Dual Language services. Using the NYSESLAT, the ELL teacher annually evaluates ELLs, in accordance with the test  coordinator's directives and the established procedures and policies outlined by the NYSESLAT guidelines. We also look at the   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          97      previous NYSESLAT scores if there is any. This data gives us insights into the student’s ability and potential. Paste response to  questions here:        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ELLs are provided with differentiating instruction, which consist of vocabulary build up, assignments, class presentations,  grammar building, support in phonetics, listening, reading, writing, and speaking activities. Formally leading to ELLs  progressing in English proficiency.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The results of the NYSESLAT test is used by the ELL teacher to identify students modality. For new students the NYSIITEL test is  administered and evaluated.  Based on test results supplementary work is given such as the Achieve 3000 program.  The lexile  test that is available in the Achieve 3000 program is used to determine the reading level for each ELL student.  Based on results  of LAB-R, NYSESLAT test, teacher-made interim assessments, student conferences, teacher observation and collaboration,  SMART goals  an academic plan is established for each student to address any defiiciencies identified during testing.  Due to  the low nuber of ELLs (4) ther is no AYP goal.     Our students are serviced using a Freestanding ENL pull-out model. During pull-out, the students are instructed in an ELL  classroom in heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels) groups of no more than 15 students.  The mandated number of  instructional minutes is provided according to the proficiency level as per CR Part 154. Explicit ELL instruction is delivered in  the freestanding ELL program.  The teacher makes extensive use of ELL and content area materials. There is also an intense  look and analysis of all reports and formal assessments. Goals are evaluated and in keeping with our ultimate goal finality  comes when a student graduates from the program and enters college and is able to cope at this level. Students are therefore  encourage to keep in touch and they do. The success of our ELL program is evaluated based on test scores and student  progress on ELL test, regents, and graduation rate.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data is gathered the information collected is incorporated in the instructional process and into the classroom  practice. Using this data the information collected helps in adjusting teaching, and learning for the following terms. This data  informs the teacher about the students understanding, so timely adjustments can be made in ensuring that students achieve  targeted standards and learning goals at a timely fashion.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   below NA     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   During the 2016-2017 school year 3 out of 13 students achieved the fifth level, proficient/commanding on the NYSESLAT  test.  Although these students have tested out the ELL teacher continues to service them in collaboration with their content  area teachers. ELL students have also shown language proficiency growth in the 2017 NYSESLAT test by moving up at least one  or two levels.       Based on the results of the NYSESLAT test the patterns across performance levels indicate that even though most of our Ells  are long term Ells, and still have problems with mastery regarding comprehension of informational texts. There is a  significant  problem with vocabulary, but the exam also indicates that students are progressing in the cognitive language  proficiency skills needed to improve academically.     As per the NYSESLAT data across proficiency levels of  11 ELL students scored above their previous level in the speaking  section. 10 students showed an increase in the listening section, 10 students increased their scores in the reading section  and 10 students showed an increase in the writing section. 3 students moved from the advanced level to the proficient level   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          98         on all performance levels from the previous year. Our assessment indicates that students need vocabulary enrichment, close  reading practice, and additional analytical strategies in order to show more significant movement.        Ells have been provided with:       -  Dictionaries in their native language.       -  Translators and dictionaries to assist in comprehension       - Periodic tests that mirrors the NYSESLAT test       -  Encouraged to use their native languages and experiences        -  Laptops to do assignments, research, etc.       -  Achieve 3000 reading program        -          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structure that is used to disseminate these findings and make adjustments to our programs take place during professional  development meetings. ENL along with content area teachers meet and look over the methods used and modify current  practices based on student needs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       Free standing ELLs are provided instruction in English with home language support. ENL skills are integrated in the  lessons and student activities in the content area of instruction.  We use a pull out model by which students receive  the designated number of ENL instructional hours.  The ELL teacher also collaborates with the classroom teachers to  include activities and tasks in content area lessons for ELL students.                                                  b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               Students in ENL are taught in English using ELL strategies, methodologies, and native language support for specific  amounts of time as determined by the NYSESLAT or NYSIITELL test.                                                          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Core content is delivered in English.     A direct instruction approach is used in all classrooms.  Resources and  textbooks/workbooks are aligned with the common core learning standards.  Content area teachers use a variety of strategies  including kinesthetic and tactile responses, web-quests, and group work.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          99                 The focus is language acquisition with a focus on grammar and writing.  The focus of instruction is reading, writing,  listening, and speaking.  Students learn vocabulary, grammar, writing skills, listening skills, reading, and writing.  Data from  regents exams, and state tests like the NYSESLAT drive instruction. Students also write essays which mirror the tasks on the  English regents.   Classes are heavily novel based. Novels are taught using QTEL strategies. ELL instruction is designed to  mediate learning of various proficiency classifications through differentiated instruction for students.               Based on test results the NYSESLAT review book is used to address individual student needs. Grade appropriate novels are  used to scaffold vocabulary and enhance reading skills.  In each content area of instruction the needs of ELLs are identified  using various assessments such as, teacher-made test, Regents Prep tests, and reading assessment tests.. There is also on- going collaboration between the ESL teacher and the content area teachers regarding curriculum, best practices, and  establishing multiple entry points.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       ELL students are informed that they can take their content area exams in their home language.  If a Hispanic student scores  below proficiency in his or her NYSIITELL test they are allowed do the Spanish Lab R in their native language.  All ELL's are  provided with dual language dictionaries if applicable.                                                           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Plan fo      ELLs in school 4-6 years/Newcommers & Developing ELL students:   Based on results of NYSIITELL, NYSESLAT test, ITT interim assessments, student conferences, teacher observation and  collaboration  SMART goals are established for each student.  The objective is to provide students with the support and strategies they need  for academic and transitioning out of ENL.     Plan for ELLs in school 6 years completed or more / Long Term ELL students:  Our plan for long term ELLs is to focus on intensive parental involvement through our parent coordinator.  They will also be  fully served by the ENL teacher in a push-in and pull-out model. These students will be encouraged to attend our after school  program  where they can receive additional assistance. If these strategies do not prove adequate we will investigate the availability of  community support groups, peer-peer tutoring or other after school programs.     Plan for ELL Special Needs Students:  ELLs with special needs will be serviced by our Special Education teacher or in addition to the ELL instructor.  These students  will either be tested to ascertain what services they require, or all teachers will follow their existing IEP. Moreover, we will  provide Special Education PD for our ELL teacher.                                                                  6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     There is great emphasis in teacher common planning meetings and inquiry team meetings on modifications to curriculum and  lesson plans so that we provide multiple points of entry and differentiation for Ell-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and content  mastery.  Software programs such as Plato Credit Recovery Program, Achieve 3000, Kahn Academy,etc. are used to provide  differentiation and an additional modality.                                                 2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          100         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   We have implemented an ICT model for all SWD students including Ell's.                                                    8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Intervention Programs for ELLs (AIS):  The ELL teacher provides academic intervention for all ELL students in English during  periods  7 and 8th two times per week  and after school from 3:45pm until 5:00pm, Monday through Friday.  In addition ELLs attend the 9th   period  “Expanded time  Reading/Writing Program" Monday through Friday.                                                        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Teacher teams will collaborate and plan revisions of curriculum, units of study, and academic tasks with multiple points of  entry to address the needs of ELLs, the lowest third, and SWDs. Curriculum revisions/modifications will be designed to  cognitively engage a diversity of learners i.e. ELLs and SWD’s     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are continuing all of our programs for ELLs.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL’s are given the same opportunities to participate in all school activities, initiatives, and programs. as general education  students.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials for  ELL students include ELL grammar books, modified novels, modified readers, multicultural readers,  picture dictionaries, word-word dictionaries, weekly ELL newspapers, leveled readers, phonetics building, bilingual Regents  glossaries, LUX 3 translator device and NYSESLAT prep books.       Content area materials include ELL modified lesson plan teacher’s aides and modified texts.  Novels and oral histories based on  the immigrant experience are also used to activate students’ prior knowledge. Teachers utilize relia and visuals to reinforce  content and vocabulary.       Graphic organizers, movie clips, and picture books are used to scaffold lessons for ELLs.  Moreover, teachers use a variety of  strategies including kinesthetic and tactile responses, web-quests, and group work. The focus for our students is language  acquisition with a focus on grammar and writing.  ELL is taught through a project based curriculum. The focus of instruction is  reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Students learn vocabulary, grammar, writing skills, listening skills, reading, and  writing.      Data from regents exams, and state tests i.e. NYSESLAT will be used to drive instruction. Students also write essays which  mirror the tasks on the English regents. Students read op-ed articles from the New York Times to build reading and writing  skills. They receive homework nightly and also make oral presentations and write research papers related to topics from the  class texts. Students are also taught through exposure to current events in order to expose them to the culture, history, and  life in the US.       Classes are heavily novel based. Novels are taught using QTEL strategies. ELL instruction is designed to mediate learning of  various proficiency classifications through differentiated instruction for students.  There is also support and accomodations for  Ells up to two years after they have tested out of the program.     2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          101         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided through school staff that speak the native language of the student/family.  In addition all  correspondence is written in the parents native language.  Students also have access to Lux 3 translation device, which assist  them in language communication, writing, grammar, sentence frames, etc.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Currently we have an ELL teacher and 21 ELL students.  We use a freestanding ELL model. We provide differentiated  instruction for ELLs based on the results of the NYSESLAT and  NYSIITELL test.  The ELL teacher  identifies the modality for each  of our 21 students.  The results of the NYSESLAT review book is used to address individual student needs. Grade appropriate  novels are used to scaffold vocabulary and enhance reading skills.  In each content area of instruction the needs of ELLs are  identified using various assessments such as Regents Prep tests, teacher-made tests, and on-going collaboration between the  ELL teacher and the content area teachers.  They also work collaboratively to create lesson plans with multiple entry points  that include strategies specifically geared to meeting the needs of our ELL students.       The mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the proficiency level as per CR Part 154. Explicit ELL  instruction is delivered in the freestanding ENL program.  The teacher makes extensive use of ELL and content area materials.  The CR Part 154 mandates are addressed in the instructional plan for language development.  The ELL teacher prints out the  RLAT report weekly. Students are given the amount of classes allocated according to their proficiency level. The ELL teacher  also prints out the RLER report, which tells which students need to take the NYSIITELL test. Students are placed in the  appropriate class according to their proficiency level.     The ELL teacher works with the school programmer to ensure that we provide all students with their mandated instructional  minutes.  High school students on beginning level receives 560 minutes of instruction and high school students on the  intermediate level receives 360 minutes of ELL instruction per week.  New ELL students receive instruction based on NYSIITELL  results. Advanced ELL students in high school receive 180 minutes per week as required.     English language acquisition is emphasized in the content area of instruction using a balanced literacy approach with visuals  and reading.  Language functions and structures are taught within the context of the lesson.  The instructional components are  based on the New York State ENL standards 1-5.  The teacher makes extensive use of modeling and scaffolding strategies to aid  students in language acquisition.  To address pre-reading during reading skills, and after reading skills the ELL and classroom  teachers employ strategies such as modeled reading, skimming, scanning, re-reading for detail, summarizing, read aloud,  etc.  Graphic Organizers are used to aid in language acquisition and writing.  For more advanced students, research activities  across the content area are incorporated in the lesson to aid with writing skills and reading comprehension.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials for  ELL students include ELL grammar books, modified novels, modified readers, multicultural readers,  picture dictionaries, word-word dictionaries, weekly ELL newspapers, leveled readers, bilingual Regents glossaries, LUX 3  translator device and NYSESLAT prep books.       Content area materials include ELL modified lesson plan teacher’s aides and modified texts.  Novels and oral histories based on  the immigrant experience are also used to activate students’ prior knowledge. Teachers utilize reading and visuals to reinforce  content and vocabulary.       Graphic organizers, movie clips, and picture books are used to scaffold lessons for ELLs.  Moreover, teachers use a variety of  strategies including kinesthetic and tactile responses, web-quests, and group work. The focus for our students is language  acquisition with a focus on grammar and writing.  ELL is taught through a project based curriculum. The focus of instruction is  reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Students learn vocabulary, grammar, writing skills, listening skills, reading, and  writing.

Students are also taught through exposure to current events in order to expose them to the culture, history, and   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          102         life in the US.       Classes are heavily novel based. Novels are taught using QTEL strategies. ELL instruction is designed to mediate learning of  various proficiency classifications through differentiated instruction for students.  There is also support and accomodations for  Ells up to two years after they have tested out of the program.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs start off the school year with a welcome orientation for both students and parents. This  orientation  familliarizes the students and parents with the school and the supports that are available for ELLs and their  families.  The ELL Orientation is facilitated by the ENL teacher, the guidance counselor, and the parent coordinator. Our parent  coordinator is available to parents throughout the transition process and continues the ELL orientation as new students arrive  throughout the school year      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Mandarin is offered as an elective in the school.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In addition to the professional development trainingt hat is provided for all teachers on Monday's from 2:30pm - 3:45 pm the  ELL teacher is scheduled to attend DOE workshops as announced.  There is on-going professional development provided to  teachers three times a week using the WestEd model for language acquisition.  Teachers, administrators and support staff  learn to scaffold complex text using strategies such as jig-saw, think-pair-share, and collaborative team posters.

Language functions and structures are taught within the context  of the lesson.  The instructional components are based on the New York State ELL standards 1-5.  The teacher makes extensive  use of modeling and scaffolding strategies to aid students in language acquisition.  To address pre-reading during reading skills,  and after reading skills the ELL and classroom teachers employ strategies such as modeled reading, skimming, scanning, re- reading for detail, summarizing, read aloud, etc.  Graphic Organizers are used to aid in language acquisition and writing.  For  more advanced students, research activities across the content area are incorporated in the lesson to aid with writing skills and  reading comprehension.    As stated above teachers are developed using the WestEd strategies for language  acquisition.  Professional development is  carried out whereby teachers assume the roles of students using the workshop model.  The facilitator provides a mini- lesson/focus for PD and then models strategy, after the model teachers are then asked to practice the strategy  modelled.  Additionally, teachers meet during strategic inquiry to create/modify  lessons and units where the best practices  are infused.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          106         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ELL teacher in conjunction with the guidance department meets with the teachers to advise them and collaborate on  programming needs for ELL students transitioning from Middle School to High School.  In addition to the high school ELL  program students meet with their guidance counselors at least once a week in a one to one advisory session.  During these  sessions students learn time management and study skills in an effort to increase their level of  success.                                                                                                                On-going professional development is provided by the DOE Office of ELL. The ELL  teacher provides support to content area.   The ELL teacher attends weekly departmental  head meetings and is a   member of the Inquiry Team.  Our entire staff including guidance counselor, secretary, assistant principal, and teachers  receives ELL professional development. Differentiated instruction, scaffolding, language support, vocabulary building, and  process words are   professional development topics. ELL training is provided throughout the year for all the staff during common preps, study  groups and during monthly professional development workshops throughout the year in excess of the required 15% of total  hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for the ELL teachers per year.  The main focus is on how to address the needs of  our ELL students in the content area of instruction.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     During parent engagement which is held once a week,  the ENL and content area teachers telephone and arrange meetings  with the parents of ELL's.  If needed translation services are arranged beforehand.                                                        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Under the community based school (CSC) initiative the CBO, Counseling In Schools in collaboration with Brooklyn Collegiate  staff will implement measures in which continued outreach will be conducted to get to know students’ families on a more  individual basis.  These relationships and the knowledge gained from them, will become the basis for establishing increased  parent engagement and participation for all students including ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Heather Newman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          108                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Brooklyn Collegiate                                                                              School DBN: 23K493  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To determine the oral and written translation needs of the school the Parent Coordinator that enrolls students  and gathers Pupil Personnel information collaborates with the ENL teacher. They review the Home Language  Identification Survey, CR Part 154 report, and conduct a parental needs survey during registration. Information is  also gathered during the ESL Parent Orientation meeting that is held at the beginning of the school year. The  home language survey results and information provided by the parents at the ELL parent orientation is recorded  on the students “Emergency Blue Card” and in the students “Cumulative Records Folder”, and updated in the ATS  system.    For each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance services is  given a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          110      interpretation services.

This was  determined based on a review of the  Home Language Identification Survey, CR  Part 154 report, and the parental needs  survey conducted by the Parent  Coordinator during student registration  and during the ENL Parent Orientation  meeting that was held at the beginning  of the school year. The home language  survey results and information provided  by the parents at the ELL parent  orientation is recorded on the students  “Emergency Blue Card” and in the  students “Cumulative Records Folder”,  and updated in the ATS system.    Parents whose primary language is a  covered language and who require  language assistance services are given a  copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and  Responsibilities. The Parent Coordinator  and/or the ENL teacher review the  parent(s) rights regarding translation and  interpretation services. A sign in each of  the covered languages, is posted at the  entrance of the school indicating the  availability of interpretation services           3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
