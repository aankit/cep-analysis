This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 32 Mission Statement    Section 4: CEP Overview      We believe that a great education is one that works in partnership with its families and community to develop  students to their fullest intellectual, creative, social-emotional, and physical capacities. PS 32’s mission is to provide  and support challenging and rigorous educational opportunities to ensure academic excellence for all students in a  safe and caring learning environment. Engaging in rigorous and challenging common core aligned curriculum guided   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      by data, and research-based instructional practices, ensuring that all students are on the path to being college and  career ready.    ~~~~~      PS 32x Arts Mission Statement   Our goal is that every student will develop an appreciation of the arts. Through theater, dance, music, poetry, and  visual arts, students will also broaden their understanding of the content areas. The arts will provide students with  the opportunity to share their talents and their achievements with the community. The arts help create well-rounded,  engaged students because the arts empower children to be creative and imaginative individuals.   ~~~~~            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Master Schedule/Budget : Strategic and creative scheduling and budgeting reflect our philosophy around culture and  climate, curriculum development, instruction, teacher teams, social/emotional development, student centered  learning, engagement, group activities, programs, the arts, and family engagement. The school culture is centered  around professional learning that has directly impacted student performance and progress demonstrated in multiple  data points over time. Our core values are evident based on the time and money we invest in rigorous curriculum,  student engagement, professional learning, the arts, and family engagement.   Strong Teacher Teams : Grade-level Teacher Teams have a common preparation/planning period every day to meet.  This is in addition to the weekly PLC (Professional Learning Community) meeting, which is strategically scheduled,  providing teacher teams with three consecutive periods (i.e. prep, prep, lunch) to engage in professional learning (i.e.  analyzing student work, reviewing data, planning and revision of curricula, designing assessments, setting goals). The  PLC block/structure is designed to offer teams more than just the 45 minute period required. This is also often used  by grade-level teacher teams, instructional coaches, and administrators. Lead teachers are appointed for each grade- level and facilitate each PLC meeting.       Clear Expectations and Communication: A clear vision is communicated to all stakeholders including staff, students,  and families. Our vision, short and long-term, are the actions we take to ensure we are achieving our mission above.  All staff members, not only classroom teachers, are valued and share in this vision. This is reflected in everyday school  life as evidence by school wide practices, i.e. Monday Message, memos/emails, staff appreciation, feedback (not  solely Advance, variety of methods). Most important to highlight is the community that shares in this vision and  makes contributions to our vision. Expectations of how we believe children learn best and what we value most in an  educational setting are clearly communicated to all PS 32 community members. We use Google Drive as a platform  for communication to share all meeting agendas and school resources.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     At PS 32 we strive to establish a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by  teachers and their peers. As evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, 72% of staff responded positively in  the area of "Peer Support for Academic Success", 73% positive responses in the area of Safety, and 84% of positive  responses in the area of "Social Emotional". Our 2017-2018 Advance Data also illustrates that All of our teachers have  received an overall rating of Effective or Highly Effective in Domain 2 of the Danielson Rubric. Further illustrating that  our teachers are creating an environment of respect and rapport and managing student behavior well.    Our priority needs revolve around Classroom Behavior with an overall score of 67% on the 2017-2018 School Quality  Guide. Only 64% of teachers expressed that students listen carefully when a teacher gives directions and only 59% of  teachers say students behave well in class even when the teacher isn't watching.    To ensure that these areas are addressed and that we are supporting the whole child the following are in place:     The School Initiative Team (SIT) will continue to meet weekly to discuss the SEL needs of hte entire   community and carry-out and create resources for all stake holders.     A school-wide behavior expectation and modification plan will continue (Class DoJo, School Behavior Matrix,   POWER, celebrations)     Monthly Core Values celebrated across the PS 32 community.    Continue RULER training and implementation school-wide.    Continue Morning Meeting to build community and relationships among all students and staff - school wide   initiative every morning.

The School Quality Report highlighted that 62% of families  say that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school. We will continue to promote new  school programs that involve parents as partners. The data in the School Quality Guide also make it evidence that as a  school community we need to increase community awareness of resources, programs, and events. As well as making  student work readily available to share with families.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 32, in compliance with Federal and State requirements as outlined in Title I,  Part A, Section 1118 ESSA. is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;                    Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Based on an analysis of the 2017 NYSESLAT scores we see a  need to provide additional supplementary work in reading, writing and listening.  ENL teacher,  classroom teachers, and The Core Instructional Team of 10X032 has analyzed the ELL data  determining school, grade-level, class, and individual student trends, strengths, and areas most in  need.  The data has impacted units of study,  differentiated options/activities, explicit whole  group and small group instruction/conferences, ENL programs and instruction, AIS instruction,  and extended day/week programs.  Goals (short and long-term) include providing students with  supplemental guidance and implement strong student supports in order to increase both  performance and progress rates.    Our ELL students in grades K - 5th Grade (Newcomers, current ELLs, long-term ELLs, and  former ELLs) are afforded equal access to all school programs (After School and Saturday  Programs).  Students are selected for the various programs based on their needs and strengths.  We look at students who performed at each level of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL - Entering,  Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, Commanding - and make instructional decisions based on  that data.  Students are given  the opportunity to work in one or more programs based on their  needs and strengths.  Students are given the opportunity to work in one or more programs  including after-school and Saturdays.  These programs include small group instruction ( reading,  writing, and mathematics), English Language Spring Forward ( Literacy Academic Intervention  Services) Reading Program Soluciones    (Literacy Intervention for ELLs in  Spanish) NYSESLAT practice ( using Continental Finish Line New York ELL's  workbook) and  i-Ready .  These programs are in place to help students overcome obstacles and decrease the  achievement gap of our ELL's by providing them with tools and strategies that they will need to  become more successful.    Targeted Supplemental Programs    i-Ready: i-ready program is used throughout the instructional school day, the data provided  allows teachers to support and target specific skills/ strategies for direct instruction during the  supplemental programs.  This data specifically supports decoding, comprehension, fluency,  social and academic language, vocabulary development.      Students are grouped first according to overall data collected by multiple sources  (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Computer-based Intervention Programs, State Examination Data, In- house formative and summative assessment data integrated into all content area unit of studies,  In-house simulations).  Groups are flexible as knowledge of students increase, including   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   analyzing current/new data.  Teachers move student groups depending on progress and/or lack  of.  Grouping may also target specific modalities in addition to targeted skills/strategies.    The extended day/week  program and Saturday Program for ELLs is taught by certified TESOL  or Bilingual teachers and it begins in January.  Teachers have common planning periods where  they plan for such instruction. The after school/week program will target student needs and build  skills necessary to show progress in the four modalities. It is aligned and supplemented to the  Common Core Learning Standards, Bilingual Education and ENL services required by CR Part  154.  The program will develop students comprehension skills and increase their independent  reading levels measured by TC Quick Assessment. It also engages students using the  Continental's Finish Line New York ELLs for guided and independent practice to further student  learning and strengthen students oral, and social and academic writing skills.  The extended  day/week program will run three days per week for 1/1.5 hours per day through May 2019 and  the Saturday program runs for a three hour block of time.  If additional funding becomes  available supplemental support programs will be developed.    After school programming focuses builds on classroom instruction/curriculum.  This is in  addition to their ENL/ Bilingual programs.  These extension and small group activities allow for  more targeted and individualized planning and instruction. They work on listening and oral  English Language Development modality through the use of picture cards, text illustrations, and  student work/illustrations.  Teachers will plan mini-lessons to target student's needs in each  modality (listening, speaking, reading and writing).  Students will use the supplementary  material Continental's New York ELLs to provide students with a balance of guided and then  independent practice to implement strategies and skills taught.  The students will use the  illustrations to develop oral language by engaging in storytelling, comprehension of dialogue and  information, texts to develop comprehension. Students will generate writing pieces (taken  through the writing process and in response to text/resources) that are organized, demonstrate  complex understanding of the task/texts and use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure  for the grade level.  The 6+1 Traits of Writing (criteria and rubrics) facilitate student learning.    Libraries for Bilingual classrooms  (Lee & Low) were purchased to supplement  class  curriculum. This  allows for independent practice in both English and Spanish for both students  and parents. Libraries were  distributed between targeted classrooms and the Robin Hood  Library.

This plan reflects NYCDOE  Instructional Expectations and Goals, and school-wide goals.  The overall goal is to improve  teaching and learning, in both English and students Native Language in addition to providing  parents/families the opportunity to engage in their child's learning and learning to develop  themselves.  Our community focuses on parent development and enriching parent engagement in  all content areas.  Our parent coordinator (at no cost to Title III), assistant principals and veteran  bilingual team members assist in the presentation of our yearly Bilingual Parent  Orientation.  The orientation focuses on our bilingual classroom and instructional programs in  addition to our ENL program and Title III student and parent programs.  This educates parents  on instructional programs and gives the opportunities to meet key staff members and ask  questions.   Targeted Parent/Family Professional Development  Parent's are notified of programs through letters sent home, school website, school messenger,  Open School Night, Parent Engagement on Tuesday afternoons.  Parent ENL Classes (offered once a week for one hour)  The parent ENL classes are taught by a licensed ENL teacher in collaboration with our bilingual  social worker and parent coordinator.  ENL classes target families at the Entering and Emerging  levels.  The class introduces basic structures of the English language and vocabulary  development.  Through reading, writing, listening, and speaking, parents learn strategies to  develop oral language, pronunciation, and reading skills.  They expand oral comprehensibility  and write complete sentences and standard paragraphs while acquiring level-appropriate  grammar and punctuation skills.  The Side by Side text/workbooks compliment the work that  students do in their programs. This text/workbook supplements the program.  Parents/families  also have opportunities to take field trips in the neighborhood for application in addition to  parent ELL workshops/conferences offered throughout the city.     Continental's  Finish Line New York ELLs ( Bilingual Common Core)     The supplemental text, Continental's New York ELLs, including workbooks, students use in the  program offer some great resource pages that are integrated into the parent ENL class.  In  addition, two teachers (1 ENL, 1 Bilingual certified), hold a series of three workshops aligned to  the student program and their resources. This both develops parent knowledge and also allows   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    them to better support their child at home.  Parents have the opportunity to take away a packet  mass copied that offers additional work/support for both student and parent.      Library     In addition, our Robin Hood Library is the hub of many of our educational programs.  These  programs are designed to support parents in fostering good reading habits.  Parents are  encouraged to read daily for themselves and with their child reinforcing skills and strategies  learned in the classroom and in these programs.  The library has a variety of material geared  towards our English Language Learners and families which support the programs and parent  development, specifically in literacy.   During this Tuesday open access time the licensed ENL  teacher who engages parents in the class is also available to support them during this time.   Activities are appropriate for parents of ELL's and we secure the appropriate translation and  interpretation services for our families.  Funds are also used for Translation Services throughout  the school year.   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessments and its associated feedback are essential to student learning.  We use various assessments to assess the literacy  skills ,support student learning, measure student progress and engage students with their learning.  We aim to support active  learning.     Some of the assessments used are NYSITELL, Technology based ( Imagine Learning, I-ready) .ELL Assessment Kit (Rigby), El Sol,  Soluciones, Estrellita, TCRWP, TC Quick Assessments (Independent Reading Levels), ELL Periodic Assessment, teacher  conference notes and observations, technology-based program assessments, and protocols for looking at student work.  These  assessments identify students needs, strengths, and next steps, which allow teachers and grade-level teams to plan  accordingly.    The data from student assessments helps us to determine individual/ group needs, strengths, next steps for every grade band   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      correlated to the Targets of Measurement ( TOMS) and Performance Level Descriptions ( PLDS).    Using student's data we  determine the Anchor description of  what the child can do at that grade level.  We develop units of study that integrate modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The unit plans focus in all  content areas and around Global themes that provide students with an assessment experience that is cohesive and  interconnected across modalities.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Some of the structures we have in place to support formative assessments for deeper learning are:  *Teacher to student feedback to adjust ongoing teaching moves and learning tactics.  *Clear lessons, learning goals  and criteria  *Using TOMS to plan units  *Evidence of learning gathered during lessons to determine where students are relative to goal  *Descriptive feedback that supports learning by helping students self-monitor  * Planning next steps  *Peer and self assessments to strengthen students learning, efficacy and confidence  A collaborative classroom culture where teachers, students and parents are partners in learning.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   Multiple forms of formative and summative assessment data are used to guide school, grade-level, class, teacher, and student  goals for ELLs.  The most valuable of assessments are the formative; which engages teachers/teams to analyze student work,  progress tasks/checks to identify areas of need, and unit assessment data in order to revise and adjust current and future units  of study.  Teacher conference notes are also proven valuable in identifying strengths and next steps which are communicated  to students.  Unit assessments are both CCLS aligned and aligned to what is specifically being targeted and taught throughout  a lesson/unit.     The following is a summary regarding assessment within the school community:  *   NYSESLAT Exam Data               * State Examination Data (ELA 3-5, Math 3-5, Science 4, NYSESLAT comparison)               *  NYC Interim Assessment Data 3-5, including ELL Interim Assessment               *  AIS Program Data K-5 (See Above for list of Intervention Programs, Targeted Students)  *    In-House Baseline, Midline, Endline Data K-5 (Reading, Writing, Math, Social Studies, Science)               * TC Quick Assessment Data K-5  *   CCLS Student Goals Tracking Sheet K-5  *   Unit Assessments (Criteria/Rubrics)  *   Literacy (Pre, BAT’s Benchmark Assessment Tasks, CAT’s Culminating Assessment Tasks)  *   Writing (6+1 Traits Continuum and CCLS Writing Standards)   *   Math (Pre/Post, Progress Checks, Constructed/Extended Response)  *   Social Studies (Pre/Post, Progress Checks)               *Science (Pre/Post, Progress Checks)   The data collected is reviewed in professional learning communities. Areas of needs are identified and problem of practice is  selected by the team to provide additional support on these trends.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have several structures in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered they  are:   * Organization  * Planning with grade level  across content areas  * Plan across grade levels  * Analyze data, engage in discussion  * Plan next steps/ Units  * Lab sites  * Clear goals to meet student needs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      *Curriculum planning  *Reflecting on teaching  *Communication with students and families  *AIS  *Afterschool and Saturday academy      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Our school engages in four steps to help our ELLs become successful students.  The first step is universal screeners that are  used to establish a baseline of student performance and identify students who are not making academic progress at expected  rates.  The Data gathered gives us indication that a student is at risk in a specific domain.  The next step is strong core TIER 1  instruction which is delivered to all students in the general education classroom by qualified educators.  The Data collected will  help focus on areas of need to guide lesson planning.  In collaboration with the school's RTI team, teachers receive  recommendations of additional supports that can be implemented to help students demonstrate progress. Step three is  Intensive Tailored Instruction which provides support for ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress in skills.  The last step is  Progress Monitoring to inform how at- risk students are responding to instruction.  The Data collected will be used to make  educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction and services for the student.  All of the Data collected during this  process will also be used to focus on strategies, plan future units and next steps.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   After examining multiple souces of data, trends and instructional plans, the following is concluded:     Grade Level   ----    #  of Ells            K                       13                                                               1                         26            2                        27                                  3                        32                       4                        22            5                        21      Total # of ELLS 2017-2018 =    141    For the school year 2017-2018  we have 42 new admits in grades K-5  who speak a language other than English and were given  the NYSITELL exam .  Fifteen of those students passed the NYSITELL exam. We have twenty five new admits in grades K-5 that  are English Language Learners.  Sixteen students scored Emerging level,  three scored transitioning and  eight students scored  Expanding on the NYSITELL exam.  Our focus is to help students develop social and academic language and develop fluency in  the four modalities across content areas.        The general trend on the 2017 NYSESLAT is more students are scoring at the Transitioning and Expanding levels.  Our students  score higher in the Listening and Speaking modality than in Reading and Writing.

What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structures we have in place to disseminate data findings and make adjustments to our programs are:  * Bilingual / ENL Team common planning  *Grade planning across content areas  * Planning lessons and units plans  * Integrating CCLS and New Language Arts Progression  *Integrated approach to the four modalities ( speaking, listening, reading and writing)  * Focus on academic language  * Use 6+1 traits  * Benchmark Education- English Language Spring Forward         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Integrated ENL:  Students are strategically placed into classrooms where the ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher on  how to academically and socially support the ELL's in the class.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher engage  co-planning, co-teaching, co-assessing and co-reflecting process.  Teachers plan together  one period a week and use  Google docs to update lesson plans.  The classroom teacher shares content objectives and the ENL teacher provides  language objectives and assists with scaffolding and differentiating for literacy lessons.  Depending on the lesson  being taught, the ENL teacher will teach whole class or the classroom teacher will teach whole class.  The model most  commonly used by the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher is the one teach and one assess model during the mini  lesson and "multiple groups" model during independent practice.  The classroom teacher and the ENL teacher decide  before each lesson which students they will each confer with and maintain their notes on a shared clipboard. ENL  students are mixed in heterogeneous groups based on language proficiency, reading levels, exit slips and quiz results.  Support is provided by both teachers. Students that are entering and emerging receive an additional 4 periods of pull- out instruction as per the requirements found in CR Part 154. 2. For the students that scored entering or emerging on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         the NYSESLAT or the NYSITELL, our school uses Imagine Learning to support to develop vocabulary and oral language  while also developing reading fluency and comprehension.     Self- contained ENL Class :  In the third grade we have a self- contained ENL classroom that is taught by certified ENL teacher.   Instruction is  delivered with ENL methodology and strategies aligned with Common Core and New Language Arts Progressions. The  teacher uses the SIOP model to deliver his lessons in each content area.  Students are grouped in heterogeneous  groups based on proficiency level and academic strengths and needs.  These groups are flexible and change based on  content and the particular lesson. Work for each lesson is scaffolded and differentiated based on students linguistic  needs.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                 All of our  bilingual classes, are taught by certified bilingual teachers. Our bilingual students are grouped by grade  level. All teachers participate in a balanced literacy program and thematic units, these focus on oral language  development, reading and writing through global themes and word study in HLA and ELA.  Students will also engage in  a computer based program called i-Ready that targets reading and math.  In  the reading component the program  helps students develop comprehension, letter fluency, and phonics.  In math the focus is on number fluency, word  problems, and grade specific strands (fractions, geometry, measurement) which are common core aligned skill-based  lessons.  Small group instruction (SGI) provided by the classroom teacher is strategic and flexible.  SGI is driven by  ongoing assessment data, targets student's needs, and includes various ENL strategies.  Our bilingual classes develop  the Spanish language through Native Language Arts instruction. Students develop L1 by engaging in read alouds,  group reading,  word work, phonics, units of study such as  fairy tales and poetry. Our mathematics program is Go  Math and we use Math Steps as a supplement resource in every classroom.  Classrooms contain these resources in  both English and Spanish.  Units of study in both, English Language Arts and in Math, are supplemented and  supported with materials found on EngageNY.  AIl bilingual classes also receive science and social studies instruction  in their Native Language (Spanish) for Entering and Emerging proficiency level students .  Transitioning and Expanding  students continue to receive science instruction in Native Language. Certified bilingual teachers provide Academic  Intervention Services (AIS) with supplementary instruction three times per week from September to June to  academically at-risk students.   This intervention may vary depending on students needs and progress. PS 32 is a  School Wide Program school, all students, including our ELLs, benefit from Title 1 services.  Saturday Academy, and  extended-day, and after-school programs also provide additional support.  We also use our Title III funding for extra  resources for the ELLs.  Students selected for AIS are based on a variety of data sources.  Some of the data sources  include: student work, standardized exams (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and ELA), portfolio review, El Sol, Teachers College  Reading Quick Assessment, foundational reading skills in Spanish assessed with Soluciones reading program, Estrellita  and teacher conference notes.  Students are matched to programs based on their needs.  The language of instruction  and resources also vary depending on the students being serviced.  The service providers are proficient in both  languages.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A    2.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.          One of the programs used in  ENL  is the computer based program Imagine Learning.  Imagine Learning is built specifically  to address Common Core State Standards.  Students are introduced to a diverse array of critical content.  The program  features activities designed to help students broaden their foundational, language and speaking/ listening skills, while  interacting with a variety of informational and literary texts.  Students are exposed to literature and direct instruction in  reading, speaking and listening skills.  In this program students are exposed to and acquire new vocabulary that they will  encounter in language arts, science, math, and social studies.  There are also built in instructional supports and activities to  assist students in developing language skills, reading fluency, and writing.              We emphasize language acquisition and will continue to build on programs such as Imagine Learning and Readers  Theatre.  Other supports addressing literacy based skills and strategies are: drama, visual arts, Dreamyard, music, movement,  instructional games that enhance phonemic awareness, phonetic instruction, vocabulary building, comprehension strategies  and storytelling to help our bilingual students enhance vocabulary and comprehension.  Read alouds and Accountable Talk are  also used in all content areas to enhance instruction and assist in developing oral language.  In addition, read alouds, shared  reading, and guided reading provide a direct channel for synopsis, language, and academic vocabulary.  Children's literature,  criteria charts/checklists, and graphic organizers are also created for building background and prior knowledge, as well as  language and academic vocabulary.  There are also supports and additional resource for students.  The 6+1 Traits of Writing  (Ideas, Organization, Sentence Fluency, Voice, Word Choice, Conventions, and Presentation) are used to develop and assess  student's writing.  Criteria and rubrics developed for each trait supports and assists in tracking student progress and  levels.  SIOP strategies are also used through out all instruction.  Some SIOP Strategies used are:  appropriate Language  objectives, the use of  books on tape to develop oral language, listening center activities, scaffolding which includes verbal  paraphrasing, explicit teaching and modeling, predicting, inferring and self-monitoring, cognitive strategies such as rereading,  highlighting, note-taking, using graphic organizers and identifying key vocabulary to support students in the areas of reading,  writing and speaking.              In our Transitional Bilingual Program instruction is delivered according to CRPart 154.2 regulations.  Students engage in  Oral language, reading and writing workshop in HLA and ELA.  Students in our bilingual classes engage in Discovery science  and  Hartcourt for social studies content in native language and English.  Go Math is used to help our students build on skills,  strength's and meet needs of individual students in mathematics (Program provides ideas for differentiation for English  Language Learners.)  There are supplemental  resources  available in Spanish and English (Reading Program in Spanish:  Soluciones and Estrellita)  to help students develop comprehension and make content meaningful.  Students also have the  opportunity to work on the computer based program i-Ready to develop the four modalities in all content areas.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        We begin to assess students as soon as they enter our school. When a child is entering the NYC school system for the first  time the home language survey is completed.  If it is determined that the child speaks another language besides English we  begin assessment with an Interview and by administering the NYSITELL.  If the students home language is Spanish, the student  will also be assessed with the Spanish LAB . During the school year student's  progress will be monitored using the El Sol,  Estrellita, running records,  student work, end of unit assessments, portfolio review, and teacher observation.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE)  Currently we have no SIFE Students attending PS 32.  When  SIFE students are admited they are welcomed and will have a  buddy system with peers. Peers will show student around and help them adjust to the daily schedule.   We build a supportive environment that responds to the immediate social, cultural and linguistic needs of immigrant  adolescents with limited schooling.  In the classroom newcomer centers and programs will be implemented to ease  transitions.  We will also consider how standards and the curriculum can be adapted so that SIFE students can learn critical  material in a way that is effective, accessible, and age- appropriate.  We will provide intensive literacy language  instruction.  Students are screened in both English and Spanish.  The proficiency in each language is examined and an  educational plan is developed on an annual basis.  AIS services in literacy and Mathematics would be provided.  An orientation  for the parents would also be provided.        Newcomers (0-3 years/Bilingual):  New arrivals to the country are welcomed and given classroom buddies.  They are screened in both English and Spanish.  The  proficiency in each language is examined and an educational plan is developed.  The RTI Team assists in this process.  AIS  services in literacy and mathematics are provided by Title I to support our new arrivals as well as our students who are  considered long term ELL’s.  An orientation for parents of the newly registered Bilingual Kindergarten students takes place in  June each year.  The parents and students come to the school to meet the teacher and have the opportunity to familiarize  themselves with the building, the classroom, and the curriculum.  The Principal and the Parent Coordinator, along with  teachers, organize this very successful event.  For all new arrivals there is a focus on interventions that assist them in developing reading skills to prevent these children from  becoming long-term ELLs.     Imagine Learning is used in the grades K-3 for Entering,  Emerging, transitioning,  expanding and commanding  ELLs.  Imagine  Learning is an interactive program used to strengthen literacy skills.   Imagine Learning provides students with the skills to  build listening and speaking skills, as well as vocabulary development.  Imagine Learning also develops student's Native  Language skills.     Sounds in Motion is a program also used for new comers that focuses on improving skills in listening, phonemic awareness,  articulation, discrimination of speech sounds, auditory processing and vocabulary. The purpose of this program is to improve  listening skills by introducing the concepts of whole body listening by completing activities that would focus on auditory  perception and discrimination of consonants that are often misarticulated.  Body movement is now incorporated into this  program to assist children in perceiving and producing specific phoneme sounds.        Fundations is a program that is also used to help students develop skills in reading.  It is incorporated as a 30 minute daily  lesson into the language arts classroom instruction.  Fundations lessons focus on sequenced skills that include print  knowledge, alphabet awareness, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, decoding, vocabulary, fluency, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      spelling.  Critical thinking, speaking, and listening skills are practiced during read alouds, shared and guided experiences, and  independent activities.     Benchmark Education (Spring Forward reading in English and Soluciones reading in Spanish) literacy intervention will also be  used for selected students to build skills in four modalities.    Estrellita program is used in the classroom to support our ELLS. This program serves as a bridge to English, by laying a strong  foundation in Spanish literacy that later leads to a more successful transition to English.  Estrellita has games and activities for  differentiated instruction.  Estrellita maps pictures to beginning sounds to assist children in making the connection from the  know pictures to the unknown grapheme. Estrellita introduces vowels before consonants.  The program also provides a built-  in review process to ensure that students retain previously  learned information.  The writing component is aligned with and  occurs concurrently with the reading process.       Long-Term ELLs 4-6 years   Students who are Long Term ELL’s receive a variety of services to support their learning.   Imagine learning is used to develop  fluency and comprehension, review and acquire new vocabulary in all content areas.  AIS provides supplementary instruction  three times per week during Extended Day or Extended Week Programs and these services are provided by a certified bilingual  or ENL teacher.  Student selection for these AIS groups is based on a variety of data sources.  Some of the data sources include:  standardized exams (NYSITELL, LAB R, NYSESLAT, Ell predictives, and ELA), portfolio review, El Sol, Estrellitas, Teachers College  Reading Quick Assessment, and teacher conference notes. The language of instruction varies according to the group being  serviced by providers who are proficient in both languages.        Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE)  Currently there are no SIFE Students attending PS 32.  When SIFE students are admited they are welcomed and given  classroom buddies.  They are screened in both English and Spanish.  The proficiency in each language is examined and an  educational plan is developed on an annual basis.  AIS services in literacy and Mathematics would be provided.  An orientation  for the parents would also be provided.      Students also have the opportunity to engage in an individualistic computer program called Success Maker and Imagine  Learning.  Success Maker targets students specific needs to strengthen vocabulary and comprehension skills in all content  areas.            Finish Line  New York ELLs is a program that is used to assist in incorporating and implementing strategies for ELLs on building  English Language proficiency across all modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  This is aligned with the common  Core Standards.  Students engage in activities in which they practice using strategies learned in the four modalities.  Students  read informational, literary, and functional passages to develop comprehension.      ELL's that score Commanding on the NYSESLAT who receive services for an additional two years:   Continued transitional support for students that scored Commanding on the NYSESLAT is provided by a ENL teacher during  push in / pull-out programs, or in a ENL self contained setting.   Students receive .5 unit ( 90m.)  per week in ELA/ Content  Area  for two additional years.  I-ready is also used to support Former ELLs.   I-Ready enhances reading, writing, and vocabulary  instruction.  This program has a rich and engaging curriculum and uses a variety of resources for differentiation of  instruction.  Students will also continue to receive testing accommodations when taking exams.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80               During the school day students engage in a variety of instructional strategies across content areas, to develop both  communicative and academic proficiency in English.  Students engage in comprehension skills and strategies such as strategies  for beginning language learners ( using illustrations to interact with text, frame sentences, summary with illustrations), meta- cognitive strategies (think alouds, QAR- Question Answer Relationships, GIST- Generating Interaction between Schemata and  Text, previewing text), cognitive strategies (Close-Reading strategies, coding text, mapping, graphic organizers and signal  words, question- research-outline-write), socio-affective strategies (reciprocal teaching, request procedure, peer tutoring,  think-pair-share, jigsaw, collaborative reading). Students also create their own word banks to develop social and academic  language in all content areas.  Each classroom also has a SMART board in which students cognitively engaged in interactive  lessons.     Students also use grade level materials such as glossaries, Words their Way, Fundations, Avenues, Continental's Finish Line  New York ELL's  for the NYSESLAT ENL/ELA,  Imagine Learning, Success Maker, i- Ready, CCLS Testing Preparation (ELA and  Math), guided reading books (independent instructional levels) in English and Spanish and 6+1 Traits of Writing to help achieve  personal and grade level goals.   During the school day students rotate in groups and centers to produce work examplars and discussions that reflect high levels  of student thinking, participation and ownership.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Based on baseline and ongoing assessment data we identify students strengths, needs and next steps allowing us to create  individual instructional plans that target students diverse needs by building on their strengths and interests.      Some of our ELL’s receive mandated support services as stated on their IEP’s.  These mandated services may include class  assignments to a monolingual class with ENL services; SETTS ( push in/ pull out); Bilingual Speech Services; and/or Bilingual  Guidance Services. Our teachers receive professional development in ENL and Special Education.  Teachers are also  encouraged to speak to our Response to Intervention Team when they have concerns about students  social and academic  progress.  Our Response to Intervention Team consists of multiple experts and staff members: administrators, related service  providers, teachers, guidance, psychologist, parent coordinator, and instructional coaches.  Parents are also included in this  process.  The Response to Intervention Team meets with classroom teachers to discuss students for whom they have  academic, social and/or behavioral concerns.  Strategies and programs are suggested and recommended.  The classroom  teacher then meets with the Response to Intervention Team again to re-assess Tier 1 skills and strategies used and services  that have been attempted.  Tier 2 is provided at this time. If strategies/programs did not work, others are suggested and  further strategies/programs are provided.  Students are re-assessed at this time and an at-risk service(s) may be  provided.  More strategies are also provided to the classroom teacher.  Suggestions are given to parents in regards to how to  work with their child at home.  If a need persists, a formal CSE evaluation begins.  The School Assessment Team (SAT) members  evaluate the child, confer with the parent and may recommend that a student receives one or more of the mandated services  on an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP).       I-Ready is also used as an intervention for ELLs with special needs.  I-Ready is a pull-out program which enhances reading,  writing, and vocabulary instruction for struggling readers.  I-Ready has a rich and engaging curriculum and includes a variety of  resources for differentiated instruction.      Some of our ELL students receive Academic Intervention Services, which are provided if needed.  Teachers and supervisors  examine a variety of data (formative and summative) and determine intervention programs and strategies which will support  classroom instruction and academic growth.  AIS may be provided during the school day and/or in an extended-day program  by a certified Bilingual or ENL teacher.  Some Bilingual students also receive Bilingual guidance services on a 1-1 basis or in a  group from one of our non mandated guidance counselors.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our ELLs also receive additional support in the content areas by working in small groups with teacher assistance and guidance  when needed.  This also includes individual and small group conferencing in all content areas.  Teachers work with our  instructional coaches in the various content areas to incorporate different strategies that will help make material more  comprehensible for our ELL students.  Students are able to work in small groups, strategy groups, use technology-based  programs and after-school program.  Students engage in various activities to develop their ability to make predictions, draw  conclusions, identify main idea and supporting details, and develop other areas of comprehension.  Students are also  encouraged to use manipulatives , materials and tools in the classroom and strategies learned.  Student supports and tools are  also provided in notebooks, folders, and at times taped to students desks.  Bilingual classes receive literacy enhancement by a  bilinugal certified teacher Elisabete Melo) who focuses on supporting students' needs and developing their strengths in order  to ensure success in literacy units of study. Students will also continue to engage in technology programs such as I-Ready,  Success Maker and Imagine Learning.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?         Our school is going to continue to develop units of study, daily lessons, and programs that meet the needs of our  students.  Our students will engage in an Enrichment Program that allows students to engage in project-based learning while  incorporating students interests and strengths.        Selected students in grades K-5 will also engage in a Literacy Intervention for reading in English (Spring Forward) and in Spanish  (Soluciones).     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?     We do not have any programs that will be discontinued for this school year.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.                     Our ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Students are selected for the various programs  based on their needs and strengths.  Students are given the opportunity to work in one or more programs including before and  after-school such as small group instruction ,  English Language Spring Forward (literacy AIS intervention), NYSESLAT practice  and i-Ready, that will help students overcome obstacles and give them tools and strategies that they will need to become  more successful.  ELLs are also engaged in enrichment programs during and after-school such as: chorus, guitar, visual arts  club, mural making, karate, drumming, swimming, basketball, soccer, math club, chess, technology club, and a grant funded  21st century learning program with a strong visual arts and academic support component.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELL students also receive additional support by using classroom materials  such as mentor texts ( English and Spanish),  content  area textbooks( English and Spanish), picture dictionaries ( English and Spanish), thesaurus, supplementary materials that are  level appropriate for students, computer software programs, Smart Board accessibility, Imagine Learning ,  i-Ready,  language/grammar development games, and books on tape in the listening center. Science and social studies student texts and  supplemental materials are in Native language (Spanish).       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     Native Language support is delivered according to CR-Part 154.2 requirements in conjuction with tools and strategies  previously mentioned.  Students also have access to Literature in their Native Language and glossaries.   Students are provided  with units of study in HLA such as Fairy Tales, Fables and Folktales from around the world. A bilingual certified teacher  (Elisabete Melo) provides literacy enhancement for K-2 Transitional Bilingual classes.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   ELL services and resources correspond to student's current levels, needs, age and grade-level. The RTI team meets with  classroom teachers and support service personnel to monitor students progress and make changes to programs and/or  interventions if needed.  Our ELLs also receive supplemental resources that are grade and age appropriate to make content more comprehensible and  meaningful.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs have the opportunity to visit and familiarize themselves with our school before the beginning of the  school year.  Parents of new students entering kindergarten have the opportunity to attend our kindergarten Parent  Orientation.  In addition, the students are encouraged to attend the Early Kindergarten Program that takes place one week  prior to the beginning of the school year.  It allows students to attend school a couple of hours a day and meet the teacher and  peers in a calm, friendly environment.  New admits to other grades have the opportunity to come in with parents to meet the  teacher and familiarize themselves with our school.  Students are also given classroom buddies to help them adjust and  become comfortable in our school.  Parents and teachers talk and meet regularly, both formally and informally, depending on  students needs.  Parents request this time a few days in advance.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)?

How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development  for all ELL personnel at our school will meet the New CRPart 154 requirements which states 15%  (5.5 hours) of ELL specific professional development for all teachers and 50% (17.5 hrs)  ELL specific professional development  for bilingual education and ENL teachers.  Professional Learning Community Meetings, ELL meetings, Calendar Days, and common planning periods are used for  consultants, administrators, instructional coaches, and Lead Teachers.  Agenda's are based on school and grade-level data in  addition to student and teacher needs.  Goals are publicized with expectations and are communicated to all students.  Grade- wide goals, teacher goals, and student goals are all aligned and reflect school data and goals.  Student goals are discussed in  class and are revisited on a regular basis.  All grade goals are kept in work folders and portfolios.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83      * Our professional learning teams by grade have weekly team collaborations and monthly calendar days to discuss:  * Collecting and analyzing student data  * unpack and revise units of study/ curriculum  * Share best practices  *Reading Institutes  * Writing institutes     All teachers are involved in content are workshops which include but not limited to :  * Leveling text using Fountais and Pinnel  * Summer institutes  in each content area  *New Teacher workshops  * guided reading instruction  * Rotational Reading ( independent reading, guided reading groups, reading stations)  * Using various forms of media during our literacy units  * Go Math program components and lesson lay out  * Determining go math assessments  * Developing academic vocabulary in each content area  * Discussion protocols to support student engagement  * Formative assessments: checking for understanding  * Providing students with effective and meaningful feedback  * Understanding TOMS  * Understanding and Using New Language Arts Progressions  *Student LED conferences  *Adult writing mentor workshops  *Fundamentals of conferencing  *Mirror writing  * Using exemplar work  * Writing tool kit        During the school year our guidance team also engages and attends  several workshops.    *Some workshops are:   *Child Abuse Prevention and intervention training  *Suicide Prevention  *Assist students Returning from court mandated settings   *Guidance Expo  *McKinney-Vento Workshop     Our school secretarie also attends  several workshops which include:  *NYS Teachs at Advocates for children  *MCKinney - Vento workshop  *ATS  *Pupil Transportation  * Relaxation / Stress management course  *General Auditor P.D.    *Andi- Audit Nov.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   All teachers both bilingual and monolingual are offered professional development that is targeted on understanding the Home  Language Arts progressions and how they directly link to the New Language Arts Progressions.  The Transitional Bilingual Team  (TBE) closely reviews literacy units of study to ensure fluidity and that each standard being addressed is taught at a  developmentally appropriate level aligned with the aforementioned Standards. Teachers are provided with support on how to  create material that will scaffold and assist students at all proficiency levels in their native language and their second language  when applicable.  As students proficiency develops, the scaffolds available change to ensure academic success while promoting  independence and confidence in preparing them for middle school.               There are English Language Learners in most of the monolingual classes at PS 32.  Professional development in using ENL  strategies is provided for both Bilingual and Monolingual teachers by the Certified ENL Teacher.  Strategies are also infused  into the professional development weekly by our literacy and mathematics coaches.  Our Bilingual Team meets monthly and  will continue to look at how instruction and tasks address the needs of our ELL population.  The team will continue to examine  the expectations and quality of classroom instruction, environments, differentiated instruction, academic rigor and  assessments.  All Bilingual Classroom Teachers analyze NYSESLAT data in addition to ongoing assessment data.  They are  involved in the grade level planning for units of study and planning daily lessons with instructional coaches.  Time to reflect on  best practices and collaborative planning happens weekly.  All Bilingual Educators have had and will continue to have the  opportunity to share ideas, materials, and discuss the need for additional resources.  Professional development opportunities  were also presented when teachers attended professional development in QTEL and shared information learned with the rest  of the team.  All records of agenda's, sign-in sheets, reflections, and professional development tracking sheet reflects the  above.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Throughout the school year, parents of all ELL students are sent progress reports outlining their child’s academic and language  development.  End of unit assessments and culminating writing assessments are analyzed and next steps are  generated.  Parents are notified and invited to meet with teachers on Tuesdays during our schools parent outreach time.  At  these meetings, teachers discuss recent assessment results and reinforce various ways the parent can continue to support  their child at home both socially and academically.  Translators are provided and are present during the meeting with the  parent and teacher.  Parents are also offered after school workshops on Tuesdays where they can come to school and learn  about a variety of topics ranging from how to support their child emotionally, how to encourage the use of the New language  at home, goal setting, technology, nutrition, Asthma, children’s literature, homework help, online resources, available  community resources, test sophistication units, test support, and math/reading strategies to assist their child’s learning.  An  ENL Program for adults is also facilitated by our Parent Coordinator and ENL Teacher.    In house translation is available to parents by staff members  who speak Spanish, Arabic, and  Albanian.  For Parents who  speak other languages not spoken by staff members we use other resources such as translation and interpretation units in  order to inform the parents.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 32 The Belmont School                                                                              School DBN: 10  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During registration, parents are interviewed and guided to complete several forms. Parents are asked to complete  the Home Language Survey (part III Parent Information) with the parent coordinator, ENL Teacher or Pedagogue  and Emergency Blue Card that identifies parents preferred language of communication (written and oral).  Resources such as the school brochure, family guides, parent Bill of Rights, school calendar, school vision and  mission statements, discipline code, newsletters, school goals, and school surveys are provided in both English  and Spanish. When other languages are determined, for example, French , Chinese, Arabic or Albanian there are  designated staff members who can translate (oral and written) and we also use DOE services for languages not  covered by in house staff in order to accommodate those families . The Parent Association, in collaboration with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92      the Parent Coordinator also sends out an interest survey/questionnaire which identifies languages spoken within  the community.    In our school we create a document to record and updated parents preferred language. It is organized by grade  and class and is available for staff members to view. The data on this document is gathered using parent interview  at time of registration, office visits, blue cards , parent surveys, teacher surveys, ATS reports (RHLA, RCPL, RADL),  and conversations with parents. The data collected from parents is compared to data collected from staff to  determine DOE vendors and Translation and Interpretation Unit services that will be needed in the future to make  communication with parents more successful.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     N/A   Date as of 9/`12/2018          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you plan to translate? Include procedures to ensure   Distributed to Families    timely provision of translated documents to parents.    School Letters   daily/ weekly   We use in-house staff who are proficient to translate  documents. If there is a need for other languages we use DOE,  translation unit and DOE vendors, oral interpretation services   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93      Calendars   Monthly   See above   and website  http://schools.nyc.gov/parentfamilies/NYCFamilyGuide.htm.   Newsletters   weekly   Flyers/ Posters   daily/ weekly   In order to send home the weekly newsletters to the parents  in their preferred language we use in-house staff, DOE  intranet, written submission at schools,nyc.gov to translate  information stated. However, for parents that require  translation in their preferred language not covered by DOE we  will assign a staff member to call the parent using language  line to inform them of the event.   Translation of flyers and posters will be provided by in- house  staff members, DOE, translation unit and oral interpretation  services. We also use templates from the Internet in various  languages to inform parents of events that will be taking place  at our school.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          95      School Messenger is used to reach families . Teachers are also able to communicate with families through Class DoJo  which also provides translation. Teachers are provided with "Emergency folders" that contain a class list of students  names and numbers along with the number of the language line so that teachers can contact parents in case of  emergency in various languages. Teachers also text and email parents using class Dojo. Teachers use DOE venders and  Intranet templates to translate messages and post them on class Dojo and in emails to parents.    Parents who speak other languages not spoken by in- house staff are encouraged and guided to set up the 3 way  translation service with the HELLO SCRIPT( parents say name and preferred language spoken). In case of emergency  parents are aware how to quickly contact and communicate with their child's school.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      We provide professional development for all personnel at our school weekly and monthly to discuss mandates,  requirements, regulations for all students. Professional learning community meetings agendas are based on school  and grade level data in addition to student and teacher needs. Goals (such as using Hello Script, 3 way call translation  unit, use of DOE vendors) are publicized with expectations and are communicated to all teachers in monthly letters  and weekly announcements. Teachers are trained on how to use the 1800 number 3 way call translation unit and the  HELLO script and are provided with "Emergency folders" that contain a class list of students names and numbers along  with the number of the language line so that teachers can contact parents in case of emergency in various languages.  Teachers also text and email parents using class Dojo. Teachers use intranet DOE website to translate messages and  post them on class Dojo and in emails to parents. Weekly announcements also reminds staff to focus on low incident  languages.                 Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school fulfills Section VII of Chancellor's regulation by providing each parent with a copy of the Bill of Parent  Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. Translated  versions of this document are given to parents in their primary language that we obtain from  http/:schools.nycgov/rules-policies/ParentBillofRights/Parent+Bill+of+Rights+and+Responsibilities.htm.   Notification documents that are given to parents in preferred language can also be found on the  intranet.nycdoe.net/SchoolSupport/ translation_and _interpretation_unit and language line.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          96      At our school's entrance and around the school parents find a language interpretation posters found in the Language  Access Kit such as Achieve NYC, and list of languages available for translation and interpretation services. Parents are  made aware of the language line that will allow staff to access 200 plus languages in order to communicate. We also  post Parent Coordinators and District Family Advocates (DFA) contact information in parents language. This is also  located in the main office. During parent - teacher conferences our school meets in the lunch room to welcome the  parents. At this time the principal welcomes and speaks to them about important information. The parents are also  informed of languages that are spoken by our staff members in order to make communication between them and  their child's teacher more successful. Parents are also informed that if their preferred language is not spoken by a  staff member their are other services available such as over the phone interpretation services.    The Parent Coordinator has a Language Access Kit which includes:    -multi-ligual welcome posters (to remind parents we can assist with interpretation services)   -language identification guides   -over the phone information guides   -guides to support school safety agents   -translation and interpretation services on written and over the phone services available   -parent language identification guide to assist visiting limited English proficient parents    -I speak cards distributed to limited English proficient parents in our school                 Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parents are asked to complete a Google survey translated in preferred languages that asks them for feedback on the  procedures we have in place to maintain effective communication between staff and parents. These surveys are  completed during parent teacher conferences and open school nights. Parents can choose to complete surveys can be  completed on computer or paper form. This feedback is used to develop better ways to communicate and encourage  more parent involvement with the school community. Additionally, the data helps us figure out what additional  services parents are interested in receiving such as adult ENL classes, Spanish translation during meetings, parent  workshops and parent teacher conference. Finally, we use this feedback to determine agenda items that will be  addressed during the "Coffee with Ms. Lew" meetings that take place monthly. This feedback is also shared with the  PTA so they can include agenda items that are inclusive of all families in our school community. We also use the RCPL  report to determine which language is preferred by majority of our parents so translation and interpretation services  are always available.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          97
