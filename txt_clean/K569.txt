This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School (the Kurt Hahn School) is a 9-12 school working in partnership with New  York City Outward Bound and Expeditionary Learning Schools to arm students with the knowledge, skills and  character necessary to serve as informed, thoughtful and courageous civic leaders in their own communities and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      beyond.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Context :         The Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School (the Kurt Hahn School) is a 9-12 school in East Flatbush, Brooklyn  working in partnership with New York City Outward Bound and Expeditionary Learning Schools to arm students with  the knowledge, skills and character necessary to serve as informed, thoughtful and courageous civic leaders in their  own communities and beyond. The Kurt Hahn School emphasizes the interdisciplinary, in-depth study of compelling  topics which develop students’ abilities to creatively solve problems and think critically. It also provides a myriad of  out of school experiences through which students acquire the tools necessary to become life-long learners. The Kurt  Hahn School’s partnership with NYC Outward Bound means that all students will participate in adventure and  wilderness courses designed to enhance the development of rigorous academic skills while inspiring character  development and critical self-discovery. Kurt Hahn School students will academically achieve more than they ever  thought possible while developing and showing compassion for others and being actively engaged in creating a better  world. These programs and their aims will be fully integrated within the Kurt Hahn School’s curricula and school  culture through EL Education. EL Education is a proven national school design that leads to high levels of student  achievement and family engagement by providing the school faculty and leadership with a rigorous sequence of  professional development activities that are rooted in Outward Bound’s educational approach.      Kurt Hahn students engage in Learning Expeditions, which are standards-based, real-world projects that provide  active learning opportunities while preparing students for college and beyond. These interdisciplinary units include  expert-guided field research and the production of high-quality products that students present to the public. Kurt  Hahn is also a member of the New York State Consortium of schools exempt from all but the ELA Regents Exam.  Instead, students complete four graduation level Performance Based Assessment Tasks known as PBATs. PBATs are  tasks that require students to demonstrate accomplishment in analytic thinking, reading comprehension, research  writing skills, the application of mathematical computation and problem-solving skills, and the utilization of the  scientific method in undertaking science research. Teachers design curricula using Understanding by Design Principles,  and Expeditionary Learning Mapping Tools that begin with assessment design. All teachers design assessments that  align to the Consortium rubrics for their department and create a developmental sequence of skills by department  that build toward the Consortium standards.       Students at the Kurt Hahn School participate in Student-Led Conferences (SLCs) in lieu of parent-teacher conferences.  Students lead their own conferences by presenting a portfolio of work and reflecting honestly on what they have  learned and what they must improve in order to succeed.       Freshmen at the Kurt Hahn School present their work to teachers, staff, parents, and peers at Roundtables,  Sophomores present their readiness to enter the upper classes by presenting their work during a Passages   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      presentation in the spring of their 10th grade year, and our Juniors and Seniors present an oral defense of their work  during graduation level PBAT panels.      Seniors at Kurt Hahn also complete an independent project known as Senior Expedition that allows students to pursue  a passion in depth and intensely over time. Guided by their Participation in Government instructor, students develop  a project that provides opportunities for them to explore a topic, learn a skill, practice a profession, or explore issue  impacting the local community. Students create their own learning targets for the project and create much of their  own exit criteria. Senior Expeditions may include such experiences as internships, travel, work-study, Outward Bound  activities, or service learning projects. Students are required to produce ongoing evidence of their progress and a final  product.      Kurt Hahn is a Community School in partnership with Urban Arts Partnership. Urban Arts incorporates arts integration  into academic programs and after school art, dance, and media programming. This whole-school reform model also  includes direct service, peer-to-peer dropout prevention, and a Community Schools Director to increase community  engagement in the life of the school and the campus, support student leadership, and manage services to students  and families, such as universal vision screening and counseling.      Kurt Hahn engages in Restorative Practices as a school wide approach to community building and culture. Community  begins in Crew where students engage in culture building circles. Our work is supported by an Extended School  Day/School Violence Prevention Grant and a Participatory Peace Circles/Center for Court Innovation grant, which fund  two full time Restorative Justice Coordinators, staff professional development, parent workshops, student enrichment  programs, Saturday School, after-school tutoring, and school wide data analysis to track the effectiveness of our  interventions. Our school further supports community and culture through peer mediation, peer mentoring, and  restorative circles.      In fall 2014, Kurt Hahn School also became a PROSE school. PROSE affords teachers flexibility in designing their  professional learning experiences, as well as provides the school with flexibility in scheduling.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school serves 4% English Language Learners. These students require ENL courses in alignment with all state  regulations, including free-standing ENL and content ENL courses. Our school also serves 25% Students with  Disabilities. These students require Self Contained, ICT, and SETSS courses, counseling, and special services as per  their IEPs and in accordance with all city, state, and federal mandates.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework for Great Schools   Kurt Hahn made the most progress this year in the area of Strong Family and Community Ties. Through our many  opportunities for parent engagement, which in addition to the traditional curriculum and parent conference evenings,  have also featured: the College Café, Student Led Conferences, PTA social events such as the holiday potluck, Paint  and Unwind, Teacher appreciation luncheon, and Title I Parent workshops including topics such as financial planning,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      understanding the adolescent brain, mental health, and training to administer NARCAN. These events, in addition to  our work as a School Leadership Team, have strengthened the school’s understanding of parent needs and have  provided parents a platform to collaborate with the school about key decisions and resource allocation.       One challenge will be to renew our focus on collaborative teachers in order to strengthen pedagogical practices  across the school that promote student centered learning.      Another challenge that the school community faces will be to ensure that coursework is rigorous for students at all  levels throughout all four years and that students are challenged through the learning process with meaningful,  culturally responsive teaching, and open ended task design that promotes student-centered inquiry. Since the focus in  most classrooms is on text based learning and evidence based writing, it is important for teachers to promote rigor for  both struggling readers and those who excel, through multiple entry points.       During teacher meetings, teachers look at class and individual student work on PBATs and discuss the students’  progress towards meeting their goals. Teachers focus their conversations about practice and student work on student  achievement and look closely at student achievement data to assess the impact of their work to inform instructional  practices. In the 2018-19 school-year, this practice will continue through grade based case study development and  planning teams which will use a coherent set of practices across a grade to ensure coherence and access to higher  order thinking for all students.      Our key area of focus for this year will be in the area of rigorous instruction that is student-centered and that builds  student independence. The school community will work to ensure that coursework is rigorous for students at all levels  throughout all four years. Since the focus in most classrooms is on text based learning and evidence based writing, it  is important for teachers to promote rigor for both struggling readers and those who excel, through multiple entry  points. In addition, we will continue to grow our math program to ensure that students have access to four years of  rigorous college preparatory math instruction using project based learning.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 18K569   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   353   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Teachers worked during the 2017-18 school year to write curriculum maps aligned to performance assessments and  the state approved rubrics of the NY Performance Assessment Consortium. Throughout the year structures were  developed to ensure that curricular revisions were made at regular intervals to ensure that the needs of all students  were being met. In addition, departments developed interim assessments to ensure that students are building  independence as they approach their graduation level Performance Bases Tasks. Teachers “backwards plan”  Expeditions and Case Studies based on project based, performance assessments and work collaboratively within  departments to ensure vertical alignment to the graduation level PBATs, and across grades to ensure that appropriate  skills are developed at each grade level. Each department identified an area of inquiry focus based on student  performance in the previous year and throughout the current year.       Areas to improve include more closely adhering to the elements of expeditionary learning case study planning  including the incorporation of field work and independent research. In addition, our work this year will be to practice  classroom strategies and protocols that promote critical, higher order thinking, discussion and questioning, and  accountable talk across the school. Teachers will also work to improve systems for the use of formative assessment,  tracking student progress throughout each term, and provide students with multiple opportunities to show mastery  of learning targets in a semester based course.       Our current tenth grade class had an overall 10+ credit accumulation of 69% for the 2017-18 school year.

In our 2014-15 School Quality Review, the reviewer noted that: “Across the school, teachers are engaged in inquiry- based, structured teacher teams to analyze classroom practice, data and student artifacts. Additionally, the principal  has fostered leadership structures to enable teachers to have an integral role in key decisions that promote and  improve student learning.”    At Kurt Hahn, teachers design curricula using Understanding by Design principles, and Expeditionary Learning  mapping tools that begin with assessment design. As part of the Performance Standards Consortium, teachers design  assessments that align to the consortium rubrics for their discipline and create a developmental sequence of skills by  department that align with both the consortium and Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers are invited back a  week before the official start of school to refine and/or revise curricula and provide peer feedback focused on the  quality of curricula and assessment plans.    Teachers submit drafts of their curriculum to the school leader and the instructional guides for feedback. In the 2018- 19 school-year grade teams will meet throughout the year to develop high quality case studies that provide  opportunities for higher order thinking, plan portfolios, assess teacher tasks for alignment to Consortium PBAT  rubrics, and look at student work using the Quality Work Protocol. Teachers meet in grade teams during professional  development to review tasks across the grade, to develop a common theme or "Expedition," and plan the semester  calendar to provide balance and support for students in a particular grade. They will also meet in department teams  to refine and align tasks to the consortium rubrics on an ongoing basis, with a focus on preparing for mid-year and  end of year presentations of learning. Teachers provide each other with feedback to ensure the vertical alignment of  departments and the scaffolding of learning experiences for students in anticipation of graduation level PBATs.    Teachers use Expeditionary Learning core practices to plan units of study that include a kick-off, the building of  background knowledge, and project based learning. During Explore Week intensives, students have the opportunity to  take an intensive course, rich with fieldwork and hands-on learning that enables them to explore a topic or issue in  depth. Teachers work in collaborative teams to discuss individual and class data analysis and use the data to inform  instructional practices, plan curriculum and design assessments. While the principal provides the resources, teachers  focus on those elements of the inquiry cycle that they determine to provide the greatest leverage. Examples include,  framing questions, reading literature, tuning teacher practice, planning implementation, and examining data and  student work.    Teachers participate in several teacher teams including grade teams, department teams, advisory teams, and the  instructional leadership team. This work is inquiry based, informs instructional practices, and drives the revision and  refinement of school curricula. Department teams and advisory teams are co-facilitated with rotating department  representatives attending bi-weekly instructional leadership team meetings. Other members of the instructional  leadership team include, two instructional guides, two grade team leaders, the Assistant Principal and the Principal.  Weekly cabinet meetings include, instructional leadership team members, guidance counselors, Chapter Leader,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      Dean, community partner, and the Director of Family and Community Affairs. This inclusive leadership body provides  a venue for transparent, collaborative decision making to support student achievement across the school.   Through this collaborative work, teachers have identified a need for growth in the area of aligning content, skills, and  instructional practices within and across grades. Teachers will work under the guidance of two model teachers and  two instructional guides to: 1) develop coherent writing practices across the school, 2) build more opportunity for  independent reading across the school, 3) adhere to a coherent set of instructional practices across the school, and 4)  adhere to a coherent set of Habits of Work and Leadership principles to enhance the academic culture in classrooms  across the school 5) use the language of 100% Respect to address student behavior across the school.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.             Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 18K569 Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community. The Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39         fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress, including the effective use of Pupil Path;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments, including      an understanding of the Consortium rubrics;  sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   One of the Kurt Hahn school goal is to have students read with a purpose and write for an audience beyond the  classroom, they will be motivated to produce high quality writing and develop critical thinking skills.      Teaching artists are placed in classrooms to help develop students grad level Performance Based Assessment as more  than just a paper. Students were able to read, research, write and developed a short documentary film to better show  understanding beyond the classroom.       Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    All community members commit to building and sustaining a positive school culture by modeling the 5 Commitments  and restorative practices by first day of school 2018-19. ( Health and Wellness)         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Sustaining a positive and supportive school environment that honors the humanity of all its members requires the  participation and commitment of all members of the community who would benefit. When staff members cultivate a  positive school culture and model the school’s code of character, the 5 Commitments, they promote effective  collaboration and create an environment of lifelong learners. School leaders, teachers and students join together to  maintain a school culture characterized by courage, compassion, respect, stewardship, and perseverance. All staff  members work together on behalf of students to improve the school’s program, share expertise, build knowledge in  their disciplines, and model collaborative learning.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  When our ELLs first enter the school, most of them speak little-to-no English. The ELL coordinator administers the Home  Language Survey, NYSITELL and the MLS SIFE Screener, which consists of a native language assessment and an extensive  interview on past schooling, for an initial assessment of both English and native language proficiency.  For ELLs who come to  Kurt Hahn from other New York area schools, the ELL Coordinator and Assistant Principal look at previous transcripts and  NYSESLAT scores. The results of these assessments are used for both programming decisions and instructional planning.  For  example, students who are identified as SIFE will receive  basic grammar and phonetics workshops and support in order to  help to develop their language acquisition skills. Within the classroom, students are continuously assessed through teacher- created measures. Our school follows a standards-based grading policy, so teachers track students' mastery of key learning  standards multiple times throughout the school year, on both formative and summative assessments. Students who fail to  meet standards on formative assessments are provided with additional supports and scaffolds as needed. Kurt Hahn is a  member of the Performance Standards Consortium, so students are required to completed Performance Based Assessment   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Tasks (PBATs) in order to graduate, as opposed to most of the Regents exams. As such, most teacher-created measures are  designed around the standards assessed in the Graduation-Level PBATs.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school secretary and ELL coordinator work together to ensure that new ELL students are processed efficiently, in order to  receive student assessment data as quickly as possible. The ELL Coordinator then shares the results of the initial assessment  with all of the new students' teachers, in order to help those teachers plan for instruction. The ELL Coordinator will work with  these teachers to accommodate the ELLs, modifying instructional materials, adapting assessments, and providing native  language support when possible and/or necessary.  In addition, teachers and students who share a native language with the  new students provide translations when necessary and assist with the transition. ENL Teachers co-plan with content area  teachers in integrated classes in order to make sure that learning activities are designed with ELLs' needs in minds. ENL  Teachers also offer afterschool tutoring to assist students with classwork from their non-integrated classes. During staff  meetings and professional development, the ELL coordinator works with colleagues to identify and address challenges ELLs are  facing in the classroom and to collaborate to make sure ELLs are making progress towards graduation. The Principal and  Assistant Principal also meet with the ELL Coordinator in order to reflect on student data, evaluate the effectiveness of current  ELL services, and make any necessary program changes.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELL students' NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores are used as an initial baselines for language proficiency. Individual teachers also  create and administer baseline assessments based on the standards that will be measured in their class, in addition to  benchmarks and periodic assessments over the course of the year.  These assessments can take the form of tests, projects,  essays,  or PBATs (Performance Based Assessment Tasks).  In January  and June, students are evaluated by the ELA Regents  results and/or graduation-level PBATs , and their scores are used to plan assessment and programming for the next year.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative Data is  used to  make programming and instructional decisions. Before the school year, the ELL Coordinator and  the Principal/AP review data from the previous year, primarily Regents and NYSESLAT scores, in addition to PBAT results and  final grades. They use this data to create a program of ELL services that both matches state requirements and responds to  student needs indicated by the assessments.  After initial  teacher-created baselines, programs are adjusted if need be, and  further supports are added, such as afterschool tutoring, ENL electives, etc. The ENL teachers and ELL coordinator will also  meet with co-teachers to adjust curriculum based on baseline, benchmark, and summative data gathered throughout the year.  Data is also discussed at grade team and department meetings, where teachers work together to create joint interventions  and supports for students struggling to meet learning standards, from scaffolds to parent meetings to tutoring. At their  Midyear Meeting, the principal and ELL coordinator  meet to discuss data from the fall semester and plan any necessary  interventions or supports for the  coming semester. At their End of Year meeting, they use Spring Semester data to make  tentative plans for the following school year.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A - High School     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our ELL program is informed by data from the NYSESLAT, ELA Regents, and graduation-level PBATs that replace the other  Regents at our school. NYSESLAT results determine the basic structure of a student's program, in terms of the amount of time  in ENL standalone  and integrated ENL in either ELA  or Social Studies or both. Students who receive a score of Commanding  (either from passing the exam or getting an Expanding and passing the ELA Regents) still receive ENL support in an integrated  ENL class, either ELA or Social Studies. Students' progress on the NYSESLAT from year to year is also used to evaluate how  effective our current range of ELL services are, so that we can make adjustments in the following year. ELA Regents scores are  also used to evaluate  and inform ELL programs. When students fail to pass the Regents, they are placed in Regents-Prep   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         electives in order to help them prepare, in addition to afterschool support when necessary. The ENL standalone teacher also  looks to Regents scores to inform her curriculum for the following year. The ELA and ENL co-teachers use Regents and  NYSESLAT scores to determine areas of focus, such as reading comprehension/multiple choice vs argumentative essay skills.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   7. The principal, Assistant Principal, and ELL Coordinator meet at the before the start of the school year, soon after the start of  the school year, midway through the school year, and at the end of the school year to review assessment results, create and  adjust ELL programming, and reflect on the effectiveness of the current program in supporting students. The ELL Coordinator  also sends out periodic emails to update the staff on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores of the ELLs, along with a guide for  what that means in terms of instruction. Assessment findings are also discussed during staff meetings and when meeting with  Integrated ENL Coteaching teams in order to plan supports and scaffolds.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our Freestanding ENL program consists on both integrated and standalone ENL, in addition to ENL-specific afterschool  tutoring.    In standalone ENL, the ENL teacher creates literacy-based curriculum that supports language development across  multiple content areas. As required by CR part 154.2 , all Entering and Emerging ELLs receive standalone ENL: at least  4 times a week (180+ min) for Entering and at least 2 times a week (90+ min; more as needed) for Emerging. Students  are grouped semi-homogeneously (by similar proficiency levels, i.e. Entering and Emerging students may be in the  same class). Newcomers in their first year in the US who score a Transitioning on the NYSITELL are also frequently  programmed for standalone ENL, at least for the first semester, to help ease the transition to their new environment  and also to build speaking skills, which is often an initial hurdle. Students are grouped primarily by proficiency, and  then by grade level. Students take all other classes according to their grade level and credit needs.   Students also  receive Integrated ENL in ELA and/or Social Studies classes, depending on student need and CR part 154.2. Students  who have tested at the Entering or Emerging level take integrated classes  in both ELA and Social Studies.  Students  who are Transitioning or above (including former ELLs in their first 2 years after testing out)  are programmed for  integrated classes in either ELA or Social Studies (both when scheduling permits). In the Integrated classes, the ESL  teachers support curriculum development to ensure that the material is appropriately scaffolded for ELLs including  explicitly teaching academic vocabulary and providing regular support with all four domains.  Students will be grouped  based on their transcripts and grade level based upon what they need for correct credit accumulation.  The groupings  are heterogeneous in the integrated Social Studies classes based on the students grade level (i.e. there may be mixed  levels of proficiency in the 10th  grade integrated Social Studies class).   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time, we do not have a TBE program because the Parental Choice forms have indicated a preference for  Freestanding ENL.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time, we do not have a DL program because the Parental Choice forms have indicated a preference for  Freestanding ENL.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We are a small school with a small population of ELLs and at this time have one primary ESL teacher, and one ELA/SPED  teacher with an additional certification in ESL. The classes run 57 minutes, which enables us to meet or even exceed the  required number of instructional minutes: ELL students are either programmed for 1, 2, or 3 units of study in ENL, depending  on their proficiency levels. Former ELLs are programmed for a minimum of 0.5 units of study, though they usually receive one  full unit in an integrated content area class such as Social Studies or ELA. Students are also provided with additional ESL  tutoring (beyond the mandated minutes with their ESL teacher), and additional content tutoring time with their content area  teachers after school as needed.    -Entering students are provided with at least the minimum of 540 minutes of instruction, broken into a standalone ENL class 4  x/week, integrated ENL/ELA 4x/week, and integrated ENL/Social Studies 4X/week.  -Emerging students are provided with at least the minimum 360 minutes of instruction,  through standalone ENL at least  2x/week (4x/week when possible),  integrated ENL/ELA 4X/week and  integrated ENL/Social studies 2-4x/week.  -Transitioning students are provided with at least the minimum 180 minutes of instruction,  through integrated ENL/ELA  4X/week or  integrated ENL/Social studies 4x/week.  Students may also receive standalone ENL 2 -4X/week, or an ENL elective  2X/week.  -Expanding students are provided with at least the minimum 180 minutes of instruction,  through integrated ENL/ELA 4X/week  or  integrated ENL/Social studies 4x/week.  Students may also receive an ENL elective 2X/week.  -Former ELLs (Commanding) are provided with at least 90 minutes of instruction through integrated ENL/ELA 4X/week  or  integrated ENL/Social studies 4x/week.                    3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   We provide differentiated instruction in all classes, with ELL students given content area tasks related to the general  curriculum with language supports – picture dictionaries, increased use of visual aides and computer based instruction, and  pairing with  more proficient ELLs or non-ELL students who share the home language.  Newcomer students may also receive  home language supports, such as authentic texts in their home language or translations. As a project based learning and  Performance standards consortium school, we provide a variety of ways to assess student learning that can support English  language development. Beyond just research papers, essays, and tests, our teachers use multimedia projects, student led  conferences, art-integration, scaffolded Socratic seminars and other academic discussions to assess student progress. While all  students, ELL and non-ELL, are assessed by the same Common-Core standards, the form of assessments and the scaffolding  provided may differ.  For example, a newcomer completing an argumentative essay may be allowed to produce a shorter  product that incorporates photographs and home-language texts as evidence, but they will still be assessed on the standard of  Evidence Use (CCSS.ELA.W.1b). All of our materials are created by our teachers. ESL teachers design project based learning in  conjunction with content area teachers in order to prepare students for graduation level PBATs.  Not only do ENL teachers  provide scaffolding and support, but they also provide explicit instruction in literacy skills, embedding vocabulary and grammar  instruction in both co-taught and standalone lessons.  Students also learn strategies such as Close Reading and  Using Context  Clues to engage with challenging texts.  All classes, even math and science, incorporate literacy skills into the curriculum in  order to build towards graduation-level PBATs, which include both an oral presentation and a paper. This means that ELLs  practice all four modalities (L,R,S, W) in all of their core content classes.  All of our curricular maps are designed in accordance  with the Common Core Standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Since we have a Freestanding ENL Program, our primary focus is on sup[porting students in their capacity to be assessed in  English. However, we do provide opportunities for students to be assessed in their home language, especially for newcomers.  When students first arrive, they complete the MLS SIFE screener in their home language, which provides data on a student's   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      literacy level in their home language. Spanish speaking students are additionally assessed through the Spanish LAB. We are  also fortunate to have multiple teachers who are bilingual in Haitian Creole, the primary home language for our ELLs, and  Spanish, another common language. These teachers not only provide translations, but also provide alternate home language  assessments in their classes for newcomers. For our graduation-level PBATs, students may present in their home language  through a translator, though most of our students choose to present in English. We also have Student Led Conferences  throughout the year, in which students self assess their current progress and discuss next steps. Students are encouraged to  present their Student Led Conferences in their home language, with the help of a translator.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students  receive Standalone ENL to support with phonics and early literacy development, at least initially. They may  also receive additional sections of integrated ENL with a Content Area, in addition to afterschool ENL tutoring. Since most of  our ELLs (and, so far, the majority of our SIFE students) speak Haitian Creole, we also refer them to Flanbwayan, a community  organization that provides native language literacy instruction in Haitian Creole and other supports.  b. Our newcomers are  placed in a full unit of study of Standalone ENL classes, in addition to integrated ENL in ELA and/or Social Studies, dependent  on students proficiency level,  and receive testing accommodations. In classes, students receive explicit English literacy  instruction and appropriate scaffolding, with home language support when necessary. Students also have access to afterschool  tutoring.c. Developing students receive one to two content support classes with the ESL teacher to assist them in their content  classes, depending on their proficiency level, and they receive testing accommodations. Students may also be enrolled in ENL  electives, depending on need. While students still receive support and scaffolding, teachers focus on building  independence  and teaching strategies that students can use on their own to tackle complex texts and writing tasks.  Students  also have access to afterschool tutoring.d. Long-term ELLs receive one to two content support classes with the ESL teacher to  assist them in their content classes , depending on their proficiency level, and they receive testing accommodations. Contact  with family members and crew advisor is made bi-monthly in order to ensure progress is being made. Students may also be  enrolled in ENL electives focusing on reading and writing skills, which are usually the modalities with which out LT-ELLs  struggle . depending on need. While students still receive support and scaffolding, teachers focus on building  independence  and teaching strategies that students can use on their own to tackle complex texts and writing tasks. Students  also have access to afterschool tutoring.  e. Former ELLs (within 2 years) receive  at least .5 units of integrated instruction as well as testing accommodations for up to  two years after exiting. Teachers try to help students from relying on scaffolds to working through challenging texts and  writing assignments independently. Students are still supported in the integrated class and have access to afterschool tutoring.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     ELL-SWD receive a range of services depending on their current needs as designated on their IEPs, from integrated co- teaching to SETSS in different subjects.  During SETSS (called "School Workshop"), ELL-SWDs benefit from remediation and  acceleration for content courses using strategies such as pre-teaching, direct vocabulary instruction, graphic organizers to  understand concept, writing support, and other strategies depending on the needs of the individual ELL-SWD. In some SETSS  courses, students work on the Wilson Reading Program, a structured literacy program that focuses on phonemic awareness,  decoding, spelling, fluency, sight words, vocabulary, and comprehension – all of which promote ELL-SWDs' English language  development. ELL-SWDs also in many integrated classes- some with an ENL teacher and some with a Special Education teacher  (and we have a dual certified Sped/ESL teacher). In ICT classes, special and general education teachers work to modify grade- level materials when appropriate, provide direct-vocabulary support, give instructions verbally and in writing, and offer other  supports depending on the needs of the individual ELL-SWDs. ICT Teams work with the ELL Coordinator to make sure that their  supports best fit a given student's language needs. The ELL Coordinator/ENL teacher also participates in IEP meetings for these  students to help create measurable language goals. We also ensure that our students get extended time on the ELA Regents   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      and a translation dictionary. During PBATs we provide additional accommodations by following the consortium guidelines for  ELL-SWDs.  Students are encouraged to conduct required research in the first language using library and Internet resources  where  helpful and where available. Students may also choose to present in their home language, or  to answer a pre-planned  selection of questions when presenting at Graduation-Level PBAT Panels.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school's program is built each year to maximize special education and ELL support services.  The school offers a range of  services depending on the current need of students: general education with related services only, general education with  SETSS, ICT, and ICT with SETSS.  Many ELL-SWDs require a flexible combination of these services so that they can gain English  proficiency in the least restrictive department.  These services are also combined with ELL supports: standalone ENL and/or  integrated ENL as  determined by a student's proficiency level. In addition to weekly special education team meetings to  monitor student progress, each grade and academic department has at least one special education teacher on the team to  provide consultation for increasing accessibility of curricula and instruction.  For curriculum design we use a universal design  approach. We also focus on differentiation and we scaffold in order for our student to have access to the content, which  includes but is not limited to vocabulary instruction, reading supports, and remedial instruction in SETTS and/or ICT  classes.  The Special Education coordinator, ELL coordinator, teachers of the student, parent, and school psychologist meet  with the student during the IEP conference to determine if ICT is the appropriate setting.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Kurt Hahn tracks all students progress on a computer based system (Skedula), which is linked to course standards and provides  real time evidence of student progress in all courses according to these standards.  This allows the school administration and  ELL coordinator to track the performance of ELL students in all courses, including math and other core content area classes.  Data is also reviewed by all teachers after each marking period (4 times per year). When this data indicates that ELL students  need more support, we plan interventions such as afterschool tutoring, curriculum/lesson plan modifications, and, at the end  of a semester, adjustments to programming to provide more time with an ENL teacher. When needed, we assign Saturday  school to beginning and intermediate ELLs. We collaborate with another school on the campus to provide summer school  courses in all content areas where needed. Students may also receive tutoring and enrichment in their first language (Haitian  Creole) through the community organization Flanbwayan.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Over the past year, we have noticed that while newcomer students tend to make rapid initial progress over the course of their  first year, our  transitioning and expanding students sometimes struggle to make the jump to a Commanding, or native-like  proficiency. In order to address these concerns, we are considering adding an ENL elective focused around building academic  language and advanced grammar.  In addition, we are looking to expand our collection of home language resources;  historically, students have primarily come to us from Haiti. However, our ELL population is diversifying; this year we have an  Arabic speaker from Sudan. We are looking to order more materials that can support students in their native language.                  10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not yet had a bilingual program because the majority of parents have not requested it on the Parental Choice forms.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We provide equal opportunities to our mainstream and our ELL population to encourage their language, social, and emotional  development. ELLs benefit from the opportunity to hear and produce language in authentic contexts, and a great deal of  learning happens in the company of their peers. All ELLs are in a majority of their classes with non-ELL peers. They also  participate in Crew, an advisory class in which students stay with the same group of peers all four years. This built-in support  network builds our school culture and provides ELLs with opportunities to grow and learn from  native-English speaking  peers.  Our ELLS are also offered access to all sports, Urban Arts programs, theatre and arts programs, and tutoring.  In   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      addition, ELL students are connected with Flanbwayan, a community organization that connects with Haitian high school  students and provides afterschool support in English  and Haitian Creole, in addition to cultural enrichment.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELL students have access to the following technological resources: computer labs with desktop computers, Chromebooks and  other laptops, iPads, the ELMO, and a Gmail address with access to Google Docs and other Google tools.  Most classes make  frequent use of Google Classroom and require students to use Google Docs. Once online, ELL students are taught to use online  dictionaries like Merriam Webster's Learners Dictionary, translation sites like Google Translate and Word Reference, and  thesaurus sites like Thesaurus.com.  Students also use sites like Duolingo, ESL Games Plus, and the ELC Study Zone from the  University of Victoria to build English skills independently, in tutoring, after school, or in class when appropriate. Teachers  support ELLs with the following instructional materials: content-area textbooks, Milestones ESL textbooks, picture dictionaries,  novels, translation dictionaries, and Vocabulary books, such as Words Are Wonderful. Since all of our curricula, across subject  areas, are teacher-created, teachers rely on authentic texts rather than textbooks. This may consist of scientific articles, news  articles, etc. ELLs are provided with modified or native language materials as needed. Students are encouraged to engage in  project research using library materials and Internet source materials in both their native language and English.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the ENL program, students are assessed  primarily in English, with supports and scaffolds. However, Entering/Emerging  Newcomers may be assessed in their native language through an interpreter/translator. While most course materials are in  English (again, with modifications, visuals, and vocabulary support as needed), students are frequently provided with materials  in the home language as well.  Bilingual teachers and students also work with ELL students in their home language periodically.    At this time, we do not have a DL or TBE program.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ESL teacher and content area teachers are aware of the importance of using grade and age appropriate work in order to  make content both interesting and accessible to all students. In our standalone ENL class, we use Milestones and the  Newcomers in Action series that provide our students with high interest and low level readings.  The ENL teacher also scaffolds  more challenging grade-level texts to provide access for even students with lower English proficiency. In integrated ENL/ELA,  students are frequently asked to read independently, with a book of their choice. The wide selection of independent reading  included home language texts, lower lexile level books, and a collection of age-appropriate graphic novels in which text is  supported with images to make the stories more comprehensible. In integrated ENL/Social studies, students new to English  receive home language texts, modified or alternate versions of the class text, and authentic content-area texts, depending on  task type and need. While materials may be modified and images added, we are careful to make sure that they are not overly  simplified or infantile. In addition, to ensure that the required services support age and grade levels, students are provided  integrated and standalone ENL services in a mostly homogeneous environment for standalone ENL and a heterogeneous  environment in integrated  ENL/ELA and ENL/Social Studies classes.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Since the other schools in our building, especially ITAVA, have a larger population of ELLs than we do, we frequently share  resources, such as copies of the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB, translation dictionaries, etc. We have also coordinated NYSESLAT  scoring in the past so that ENL teachers do not score their own students. ELLs also have the option to take summer school  courses through the other schools on our campus, which can help them make up credits and further their linguistic and  academic development over the summer months.  In the future, we plan to coordinate  some PD time so that our ENL teachers  can learn from each other and collaborate in how to best support students social and academic growth.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, we hold orientation programs for newly enrolled students in which we provide  translation and interpretation of the range of services and activities our school offers.  When newly enrolled ELL students  come throughout the school year we pair them up with an ELL who has been in our school for over a year who mentors and  helps to directs the new student for a 2-3 week time period.  In addition, the ELL coordinator, guidance counselor and school  principal meet with newly enrolled students  and parents to ensure they understand their program, know where to go for  assistance, and to introduce them to their teachers and student mentor.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish elective classes are offered to ELLs .        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time, we do not have a Dual Language Program because it has not been requested by a sufficient  quantity of parents on the parental choice forms.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel have multiple opportunities for professional development: 1) weekly 80 min. professional development  sessions, which are designed and delivered by the Instructional Guides and aligned to school-wide instructional goals. These  can take the form of whole-staff or department meetings; 2) weekly Grade Team and Crew Team meetings in which teachers  reflect on student data, engage in "Kid Talk" about how best to support struggling students, plan interventions, and share  instructional strategies; 3) off-site ELL-specific professional development with DELLSS, NYCOB, NYS/NYC RBERN, and other  agencies; and 4) school visits to other Performance Standards Consortium schools, to observe effective strategies in other  teachers' classrooms.   All staff including speech therapists, special education teachers, and secretaries attend staff  development relevant to their titles to ensure they can fully support our ELLs.  Our calendar of PD includes: all Chancellor's  Days and weekly Wednesday extended PD.  Our school's membership in the NYS Performance Consortium means that students are reading, writing, and problem solving  in all of their classes, including math and science, aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  Professional learning  includes strategies to support ELLs throughout the reading, writing, revision, and problem solving processes. All of our PD is  run using the EL Education model, our whole school instructional model, whose core practices are fully aligned to the Common  Core.  Our ELL teachers are provided with additional support by attending PD provided by the Affinity Field Support office and  DELLSS.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Teachers engage in inquiry based professional development, wherein each department examines student data and student  work to identify areas of need for students, including English Language Learners.  This learning is aligned to our school's Work  Plan and is focused on Reading, Writing, and Speaking skills.  Teachers receive targeted professional learning from the ELL  teacher over the course of the year during department meetings, whole staff PDs and through one on one coaching with co- teachers.  The ENL teacher receives off-site professional development through the office of English Language Learners and  turnkeys useful information to the rest of staff.  Further, the ENL and Foreign Language teacher meet regularly to discuss best  practices for approaching second language learning at Kurt Hahn.  Whole and department staff meeting include agendas and  attendance to track professional learning.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school schedules these annual meetings after school during the first two months of school and includes the ESL teacher  and school parent coordinator along with personnel available for translation.  We discuss the progress of each child based on  the NYSESLAT results, and academic record from the previous year.  If parents are not available to meet in person, we provide  this information by phone or in writing using the Translation and Interpretation unit where needed.  The families of newly  enrolled students attend a parents' meeting at the school within the first 10 days, in which they are informed of the different  ELL programs and their rights as parents of ELLs in their home language, using the multilingual DOE video, translated forms,  and qualified interpreters or the DOE Language Line as needed. At this meeting, they complete the Parental Choice forms and  are given resources for supporting their students and reaching out to the school during the year. For our translation and  interpretations needs, we use qualified bilingual staff, translations from the T&I Unit, and services from the Big Word.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ELL parents are included in all school wide events and are encouraged to participate in student led conferences, PTA meetings  and SLT meeting using the Translation and Interpretation unit , bilingual staff, and the Big Word interpreters where necessary.  Our Parent Coordinator, Eric Waterman communicates with parents using email, text, phone calls, and a monthly  newsletter.  Parents are invited to participate in Family Day, College Café where we offer a workshop for ELLs and their parents  on immigration law and applying to college, Student Led Conferences where interpreters are made available, monthly PTA  meetings, and student presentations of learning (Roundtables, art exhibition, senior exhibition).               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Veronica Coleman Xavier, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learni                                                                              School DBN: 18K569  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      All parents are given home language surveys (the HLIS) when they enroll in our school, in addition to the Student  Emergency Contact Cards. These forms are made available in multiple languages, and we make use of bilingual  staff (in French, Creole, and Spanish) or the Language Line as needed. Additionally, we have an aggressive phone  outreach practice from our school secretary and parent coordinator who, using bilingual staff and the Language  Line, ensure that we are aware of the home language for all of our students and any resulting  translation/interpretation needs. We use this information, in coordination with the Preferred Language Report  from ATS, to maintain a document in Google Drive which we update regularly with the language preferences of  our parents for both written and oral communication. This document is shared with all teachers so that they can  communicate with parents in the appropriate language. Our Crew Teachers, who each serve as the primary  advisers and parent-contact for a group of 10-15 students, also provide updated information if parents language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      needs have changed. This information is given, in writing from the parents, to the Language Access Team (the LAC  and school secretary), who update the shared document.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    346   41   0   N/A   89   10   0   N/A   345   42   1   N/A   89   11   .002   N/A   English   Haitian Creole   French   Spanish      Arabic      Urdu           3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     At this time, we have no foreign languages that represent at least 10% of the population of the school (excluding  the languages mentioned above).           Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   Families    As students are enrolled   Enrollment Documentation (HLIS,  Student Emergency Contact Card,  Parent Bill of Rights, Lunch Forms  etc)   How do you plan to translate? Include  procedures to ensure timely provision  of translated documents to parents.    Most of these documents are already  available in multiple languages on the  NYC DOE Intranet. The LAC and School  Secretary keep copies of each form in  multiple languages in order to be  prepared for newly enrolled student  from a variety of backgrounds. For any  forms that are not available via Intranet,  we request translations from the DOE’s   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      ELL paperwork (Program Selection  Survey, Program Placement,  Continued Entitlement, Non- Entitlement, NYSESLAT notification,  etc)   throughout the year   Parent Newsletter   Monthly   IEPs/Special Education paperwork   As needed            Others?           T&I Unit, bilingual staff, or the Big  Word.    Many of our ELL students have parents  who speak languages other than  English. Most of the paperwork required  for these students is available via the  DOE intranet. For any forms that are not  available via Intranet, we request  translations from the DOE’s T&I Unit,  bilingual staff, or the Big Word. Our ELL  coordinator keeps these documents on  hand in multiple languages in order to  ensure that the documents are provided  in a timely manner.    Per session provided to staff teachers to  translate in advance of  mailing/distribution.   Per session provided to staff teachers to  translate in advance of meetings with  parents.    2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   Student-Led Conferences   November and March   Curriculum Night   September?   interpretation service(s)?    Student-Led Conferences, our version  of Parent Teacher Conferences, consist  of students presenting their work to  their Crew teacher, a parent/guardian,  and a peer. Crew Teachers schedule  conferences with parents who speak  languages other than English using  bilingual staff or the Language Line.
