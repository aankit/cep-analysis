This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to prepare our students to become socially-emotionally aware, independent learners and leaders with  the desires, the skills, and the abilities necessary for lifelong learning. This will require creating a learning environment  which is centered around students, facilitated by teachers, and supported by home and community.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 21 is a large elementary school in Flushing, Queens, serving 1373 students in grades Pre-K -5. Twenty-four percent  of our students are English Language Learners. Twelve percent of our students' grades K-5 are special education  students. The school's population is 29.35% Hispanic, 62.22% Asian, 0.98% Black, 5.9% White, 0.21% American Indian  or Alaskan Native, and 0.98% Multi-Racial. Our school faces similar challenges as other Title I schools in New York City.  PS 21’s most unique characteristic is the size and complexity; despite this, there is a culture where students feel safe  and supported, families are included and valued, and staff members work tirelessly toward continued success and  improvement.   The six elements of the Framework for Great Schools: Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Collaborative  Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties, and Trust have informed our work. A close  analysis of the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, which was completed by 100% of families and 97% of our teachers  reveals that we exceeded the Citywide Average Percent of satisfaction in all areas with the exception of Strong  Family-Community.       Our families are an integral part of our school community. They play an important role in helping us successfully  educate our children. Taking this into consideration, we do all we can to keep families well informed and involved in  their children's learning experiences. School leaders and staff make every effort to communicate expectations.  Families are invited to participate in events such as classroom writing celebrations, Coffee and Tea with the Principal,  and parent workshops. During the 2018-2019 school year, families were invited for our first Multicultural Night. This  event was attended by 325 families. Notices and announcements are routinely translated to the home language of  students' families and interpreters are available for conferences. For the 2018-2019 school year, we plan to expand on  enhancing our relationship with families by offering more opportunities for them to engage in school wide events.    We will continue our Rising Stars mentoring program collaborating with the administration and teachers of JHS 185.  This collaboration will include increased interactions between teachers of both schools and an outreach to the  parents of students participating in the program. These efforts will help support improving outcomes for our Hispanic  ELL boys by building capacity among both teachers and parents. Efforts in providing a welcoming environment for  families that develop strong partnerships grounded in trust will continue to be fostered.       At PS 21 we are continuously engaged in inquiry; examining our work, exploring new strategies, and making revisions  based on the findings and learning of our students. Based on the Framework and the District 25 goals, P.S. 21 has  identified four priorities for the 2018-2019 school year. Our first priority is to continue to identify and support  students at risk and provide academic, social and emotional support for them to meet the learning standards.  Another priority is nurturing the professional growth of our staff members. This will continue to be a priority so they  may be able to develop and deliver an instructional program grounded in the learning standards, particularly the idea  that the standards and instruction related to the standards is for all students. All staff members will continue to have  access to targeted professional learning opportunities so they may support our students including those students  learning English as a New Language to develop their reading, writing, mathematics, and conversational skills.       In order for us to address our priorities, we have established strategic partnerships with outside providers who are  instrumental in supporting our work. Teachers College has been collaborating with P.S. 21 for more than 10 years,  supporting our teacher's professional growth in teaching reading and writing for our changing population. In addition,  to developing the standards based units of study in reading and writing, our teachers have been guided by on-site  professional development in revising their curriculum maps and revising their lesson plans to ensure success for all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      students. Our first grade and fifth grade have worked with Inside Broadway to introduce students to the magic and  excitement of live theater through instruction in performance.       For students at risk, (identified as Level 1 and 2 on the 2018 New York State English Language Arts exam and/or not  making progress on running record data), our RtI teacher uses Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) to strengthen skills  needed to access the Teachers College curriculum. The SPIRE program, a research proven program, is utilized and  implemented by the IEP teacher providing tier 2 and 3 support/supplemental services for our lowest performing  students. In 2018-2019 we will continue to the use of Wilson Fundations in grades K-2 for whole group work and for  delivering tier 2 intervention.       Go Math has been our math curriculum for the past 8 years. In the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to  administer online summative assessments in grades K-5. Additionally, we are participants in the Algebra for All. Our  math teachers in grade five have started to learn about and develop rich math tasks that support students in  developing strong habits of mind, such as perseverance and thinking flexibly, instead of simply seeking the correct  solution. Utilizing these ideas, teachers in the lower grades will participate in professional development that will  support K-4 teachers.       The school's mission not only speaks to need of knowing children well academically but to know them socially and  emotionally and creating opportunities for them to thrive in a supportive environment where everyone feels safe,  nurtured, and engaged. Students at our school facilitate activities for the 3Be's (Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be  Kind). They participate in school activities such as the "Respect for All" march, and school spirit events--topsy-turvy  day, crazy hat day, etc. Be Notes are announced on Fridays in recognition of exemplary behavior and there is a 3 Be's  "Thought of the Day" that's announced daily as a positive message. Citizenship is fostered in students by the  individualized support they receive from the staff and teachers who work closely with families informing them of their  child's achievements often in the form of a B note, Student of the Month recognition, or a positive phone call to the  family. Classes are also rewarded with commendation cards for exemplary behavior. At PS 21 there is a LionHarted  award. Students (K-5) and an adult who are not only exemplary citizens but contribute through all settings to the  greater good of the school are recognized once a year in a LionHarted ceremony. This is a practice that is uniquely  ours.       PS 21's belief is that all students have interests and talents that can be fostered in school. In order to expose students  talents and natural abilities, students participate in an interest-based enrichment program. We offer enrichment in  the arts, math, science, literacy, music, and physical education. We have also had a long-standing partnership with  Ballet-Tech and Carnegie Hall. During the 2017-2018 school year we began a new relationship with Inside Broadway, a  non-profit theater company that brings the magic, pageantry and profession of Broadway to public school students  throughout New York. This organization provided professional development with teaching artists to our teachers and  brought Broadway to the classroom.      Our school continues to benefit from the partnership with City Councilman Paul Vallone. Our RESO -A funds continue  to give teachers and students access to technology to support teaching and learning. In addition to all classes having  interactive whiteboards and the school housing a computer lab, we have a laptop cart on each floor and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Chromebooks for 10 classes. Our online support programs including Imagine Learning, and a pilot of Compass  Learning's Pathblazer to support students learning in school and at home.       We are recipients of a Project Boost grant from our New York State Senator Tony Avella. These funds, in addition to  our Title I funds, supports our students' arts education. We have three certified arts teachers on staff, one in Visual  Arts, one in Music and one in Dance. Our additional partnerships include Ballet Tech, Carnegie Hall, New York Road  Runners.      We are also in partnership with Samuel Field Y to provide a free on-site after-school program for approximately 150  children.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At risk students, identified as Level 1 or 2 on the 2018 New York State English Language Arts exam and/or the New  York State Mathematics exam, not making progress on TC running record assessments and/or Go Math on-line  assessments will be provided with Academic Intervention Services (AIS) by the Academic Intervention Specialist. ENL  (grades 1-5) students, identified as students not making progress on the NYSESLAT progression levels, are invited to  ENL after-school programs taught by licensed ESL teachers for additional support.    In analyzing our state data, it was noted that our highest risk group of not making progress on TC running record  levels are our English Language Learners. With the implementation of the Part 154 mandates, we realize that all  teachers must be versed in teaching English Language Learners. We are planning to support all teachers with  strategies to use to scaffold the learning for ENL students in our professional development plan for 2018-2019.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our work is informed by Dr. Anthony Byrk’s Framework for Great Schools. The six elements of the Framework -  Rigorous Instruction, a Supportive Environment, Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family  and Community Ties and Trust guide our work. A close examination of our 2017-2018 School Survey, which was  completed by 100% of our parents and 97% of our teachers, reveals that we exceeded the Citywide Average Percent  of satisfaction in certain areas. We made significant progress in the areas of Rigorous Instruction (increase from 4.66  to 4.72) and Strong Family-Community Ties. (increase from 3.51 to 3.95). After carefully reviewing each question in  the section of Strong Family and Community Ties, it was determined that we need to continue our work with PS 21  families. Our families want to participate in school by volunteering and meeting with their child's teacher more  often.It will be a key area for us to focus on this school year. This year we will focus on continuing to improving in the  area of Strong Family and Community Ties by introducing more opportunities for families to become involved in our  school through various activities. We will be implementing Parent-Teacher Home Visits (PTHV) model. Additionally,  we will be expanding our collaboration with JHS 185 targeting Hispanic ELL boys in first and second grade. The  expansion will include an educational component that will open this program up to families.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q021   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1425   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our school's strengths relative to Rigorous Instruction consist of the following:       1. Based on the NYC School Survey (2017-2018) , we received a 4.72 in the element of Rigorous Instruction an  increase of +031 from the previous year's survey in this element.       2. Based on an analysis of student performance trends for students on Teachers College running records June 2018 ,  whole school data shows that 65.03% of students are reading at or above grade level. This is an increase of 8.64%  from June 2017.      3. The NYC School Survey (2017-2018) indicates that PS 21's areas of strength as noted by yearly growth relative to  the Framework for Great Schools are Rigorous Instruction (4.72) and Strong Family-Community Ties (3.95). It is an  overall positive response by all stakeholders.       Our Priority needs that will be addressed in the Rigorous Instruction goal consist of the following:    1. An analysis of 2017-2018 Advance data (MOTP) reveals that 13.07% of our teachers are rated as Developing in  domain 3d-Using Assessment in Instruction and 55.12% are rated effective. In an effort to support teachers to  develop their skills in assessing student learning, targeted professional development will be provided in this area  specifically in planning for assessment in all subjects with a specific focus on mathematics. Professional learning teams  will be organized by grade level and/or subjects. Professional learning will include training in planning for instruction  that includes teacher assessments and student self-assessment with the purpose of increasing academic rigor and  impacting student concept development.    2. Based on an analysis of 2017-2018 TC Running Records data for our ELLs students there has been some progress  with a (7.36)% reduction in students identified as far below grade level. Nevertheless, there continue to be significant  gaps in achievement between English as a New Language (ENL) students and non-ENL students as noted by our TC   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      2017-2018 Running Records data above. In supporting teachers to develop instruction that is customized and  inclusive, they will be invited to professional development whose focus is on differentiating instruction for ELLs in  literacy with a focus on building vocabulary and promoting student discourse in the content areas.    3. There continues to be a wide gap in achievement between General Education students and students with Individual  Education Plans (IEPs) particularly students in self-contained classrooms as observed by an analysis of TC Running  Records data. 30.77% (TC running records 2017-2018) of our students with IEPs are at or above grade level reading  levels. In an effort to support teachers and build the capacity of the staff, professional learning communities will be  formed and lead by a Core Professional Learning Team of teachers specializing in supporting SWDs. These teams will  meet weekly, their work stemming from professional development sessions.

On the 2017-2018, NYC School Survey 93% of respondents, felt that students do their work when they are  supposed to.       2. The NYC School Survey Teacher section states that 79% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in  their classes behave well in class even when the teacher isn't watching.       Our Priority needs that will be addressed in the Supportive Environment goal consist of the following:       1. Based on a review of the 2017-2018 OORS data there were a total of 67 infractions as defined on the Citywide  Behavioral Expectations to Support Student Learning booklet in the 2017-2018 school year that required a student  intervention based on the discipline code. 42 of the infractions were at a level 3 and 8 were at a level 4. Based on this  data, we will be incorporating an further developing our Emotional Intelligence component within our PBIS  framework to help support our community learn how to understand and regulate their emotions as well as empathize  with others to help foster healthy emotional growth. It is our hope that students and staff will be more attuned to  their own feelings and the feelings of others that it will improve overall classroom climate. The Yale RULER program  will be implemented in each classroom and teachers will help to create class charters, mood meter, Metamoment and  Blueprints that will help student's build an awareness and understanding on what SEL is across all grades levels. In  addition to RULER, as of September 2018, to further enhance the school wide initiative to promote SEL we will have a  team of SEL specialists which will include two SEL Literacy specialists, teaching the Second Step Curriculum and a PBIS  specialist, to not only work with school and class wide incentives but also to target our tier 2 and tier 3 students who  based on OORS report would benefit from a more individualized individualized behavior plan.       2. Based on the data from the NYC School Survey, 86% of teachers say that adults at their school have access to school  based supports to assist in behavioral and emotional escalations.. In response to this data, our school will be  implementing more than one method for Social Emotional Learning for both staff and students. As mentioned above,  three new positions will be incorporated at PS 21 to provide additional SEL support to staff. This will include  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20      Professional Development on RULER, Second Step and Mindfulness practices. Cabinet meetings will be held weekly to  debrief members on identified tier 2 and tier 3 students in order to provide teachers with recommendations for  additional support. Support will include preventative practices such as daily behavior charts, check in/check out,  Breakfast Club and Lunch Box in order for identified students to have a plan in place and relationship established  should a crisis occur. PBIS specialist will take the lead on building relationships with identified students and their  families, as well as head the PBIS committee for school wide and class wide incentives to promote positive behavior.  PBIS Specialist, SEL Literacy teacher and guidance counselor will assist as a liaison between teacher and student and  parent and student to help promote positive behaviors for themselves and the school community.

As of September 2018, through utilizing the expertise and guidance of our newly appointed PBIS specialist, PS 21  will research how to effectively implement Office Discipline Referrals forms (ODRs), as a way to identify, monitor  and track behavioral data. Beginning in February 2019 ODR forms will be developed. Their implementation will  begin with two professional development sessions whose aim is to explain and orient the teachers and other  support staff to these forms. Once professional development has been provided, ODRs will be completed by  classroom teachers and other support staff in order to collect data on level 3 and level 4 infractions for the 2018-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25         2019 school year. In addition, the ODR’s will track resolutions to problematic behaviors and identify the  interventions in place to decrease future occurrences. Office of Discipline Referrals (ODRs) and Online Occurrence  Reporting System (OORS) will be collected and analyzed.   By February 2019, administrators will ensure that an ODR form has been developed and professional development  has been provided for school staff on the purpose of the form. The data collected will be analyzed and used to  compare beginning of year and end of year data for level 3 and level 4 infractions aiming for a 5% decrease.   The SEL Team will meet as part of a cabinet on a weekly basis to discuss identified at risk students and next steps.  The data that has been collected by the PBIS specialist will be shared with the team and reviewed during meetings  and measured on a quarterly basis, with report card distribution, (November, January, March and June), to  establish trends and to determine whether the implementation of SEL, Mindfulness and Emotional Intelligence  practices.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school's strengths relative to Collaborative Teachers consist of the following:       1. Teachers at PS 21 are committed to the success and improvement of quality instruction delivered in classrooms and  throughout the school. On the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey teachers report, 91% of teachers say that they design  instructional programs (for example, lessons and units) together.       2. 100% of teachers say that they talk with one another about instruction. This indicates that teachers see themselves  as professionals who routinely collaborate with one another.      Our Priority needs that will be addressed in the Collaborative Teachers goal consist of the following:    1. On the NYC School Survey (2017-2018) 52% of teachers say that they had the opportunities to work productively  with teachers from other schools on professional development. This percentage is significantly lower than the District  and City average and indicates that teacher may want to work with teachers from other schools.    2. In this same survey, 67% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have included  enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas.    For the 2018-2019 school year, professional development will continue as teachers participate in Professional  Learning Communities. These teams will be charged with the work of using student assessment data, formative and  summative, to drive professional development centered on our school's instructional focus and progress monitoring.  This work will include collaboration with other schools through inter-visitations.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [PS 21Q] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 21Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with The PTA parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through  school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents,  and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

At the  beginning of the year, the parent coordinator meets with the Parent Advisory committee to  determine how the school can support ELLs families. A survey is sent home to parents to  determine how we can  support the home school connection. The parent workshops will be given  at different points in the day to make it accessible for families to attend.   The parents in our community have varied needs.  The parent meetings are held twice a month  from October-June on Tuesdays during parent engagement time by ENL providers in the school  to aid and assist parents of ELLs in a variety of ways throughout the year. For each meeting held,  translated fliers go home to each family announcing meetings. Fliers are posted in the building  and our school site.  Our parent coordinator targets parents of ELLs and makes calls to inform  them of meetings that are taking place.  Bilingual translators are provided for all parent  workshops.  ENL providers explain and answer questions regarding programs we are utilizing to  deliver instruction.    Our parent coordinator has set up a "Bilingual Buddies" program to assist the school  community with translations for meetings, school events and school documents.  Our school uses  the app "REMIND" to remind the parents of upcoming meetings.  Our parent coordinator helps  to set up  1-2 hour sessions once a month for outside services to visit the school for  homework  help, testing, safety, anti-bullying, middle school preparation/applications, assistance with  immigration and public services, how to prevent injuries in and around your home, CPR as well  as health insurance.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In a review of Teacher's College assessments, 73% of ELL students are performing at level one, below grade level standards  and 19% are performing at level two, approaching the grade level standards. Formative and curriculum-embedded  assessments will be used to guide instructional planning for ELLs. Reading levels are assessed five times throughout the year  using the Fountas & Pinnell Teacher's College Reading benchmark tests.  In reading, students are given a pre-assessment  (formative) for every unit to guide educators in differentiating for all students based on standards. A post-assessment  (curriculum embedded) follows each unit to review student progress. Within each reading and writing unit, curriculum- embedded TCRWP formative assessments are included such as post-it analysis, academic discourse analysis, ongoing student  friendly checklists, individual and small group conferences. Less than 50% of our ELL students are performing at level one  based on the writing continuum and On-demand writing tasks serve as baseline assessments for each writing unit. Ongoing   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Writer's Notebooks and Reading Response notebooks serve as formative assessments. Teachers review entries to guide their  instruction on a daily basis in conferences, small group, and whole group instruction. Reading and writing are assessed by an  online program, Compass Learning. Students take baseline assessments to put them on a differentiated learning  path.  Teachers are able to view progress and run reports to inform their instruction.  An additional online program used for  ELL students is Imagine Learning students take a screening test and are directed to their individual learning path.  Compass and  Imagine learning both support students literacy skills and progress monitoring is embedded in the programs. Teachers can run  weekly progress reports to inform their instruction.      After Analyzing our data based on 2017 NYSESLAT Score testing 294 students, we found 48% of our Kindergarten students are  at the Expanding proficiency level.  53% our First Grade students scored at the Expanding level. 52% of our Second Grade  students performed at the Expanding level. 78% of our third-grade students scored at the Expanding level. After further  analysis, our students in grades 1-5 are making little to progress within the proficiency levels. Only 26% of our test takers  moved one level, 7% moved two levels. Through analysis we found an overwhelming response, only 18% of our ENL students  reach the Commanding progression level and 24% of our students remained on the same progression level. Based on the 2017  NYSESLAT scores, we found that our students perform well within the Speaking and Listening modalities and perform low on  the Writing Modality. Our ELL students in grades 4-5 performed low on the Reading and Writing modalities on the NYSESLAT  and also scored between a 1 or two on the ELA exam. 6% of our students in grades 4 and 5 are at risk levels 3 to 8. At least 10  of our students have the potential for becoming long-term ELLs. 12 of these students are both ELL and SWD, receiving more  than three years of service, who are at risk of becoming long-term ELL'S based on not making progress within their progression  levels over the past two years as well as scoring a 1 or a 2 on the ELA and Math Exams.      In response to our data we have provided our K-2 and ENL teachers and classroom teachers with Entering and Emerging  students as well as teachers of SWD students in Fundations to address early literacy skills: letter/sound identification, sight  word knowledge, fluency and comprehension based on reading levels and NYSESLAT progression levels. To support our ELL  students in grades 3-5 we have trained our ENL staff and classroom teachers of ELL students in the Leveled Literacy  Intervention (LLI) program to support skill and strategy based reading and writing supports. This program has a progress  monitoring component built in.  Our ENL staff and classroom teachers embed Listening and Speaking standards into their daily  instruction and have implement language objectives into their lesson plans. Our K-2 students who are at-risk and in need of  academic intervention were determined after analyzing data as viewed on the EDAT tool and reading level data. These  students in grades K-2 can receive intensive small group reading instruction based on the five pillars of literacy through our  school-wide RTI period. Our trained ENL teachers and classroom teachers trained in Fundations will provide double dose,  Dibbles, Great Leaps, Orton Gillingham, guided reading and shared reading to support literacy skills; phonemic awareness,  phonics, fluency and comprehension skills. Our classroom teachers and ENL teachers for grades 3-5 students who are at-risk  and in need of academic intervention will be provided with small group structured skills and strategy based lessons. These  teachers are provided with training to use the Leveled Literacy Interventions (LLI) as well as provided with training to support  their students in using close reading skills to support academic language work play activities, deconstructing sentences and  developing a deep understanding of complex grade level text as based on the work with Maryann Cucchiara. Our ENL and SWD  students use both Imagine Learning and Compass learning, to support students literacy instruction on their individual learning  paths.    The Go Math program supports students through small group and stations work based formative and curriculum-embedded  assessments.  Every unit has a pre and post assessments and an online component (Think Central).  Students can take either a  paper/pencil or online test (audio component reads the test to the student).  Based on the results, teachers form  differentiated groups. Teachers use the data generated by the benchmark beginning, middle and end of the year testing to  inform their instruction and assign students differentiated tasks. The Go Math program has differentiated ELL components and  RTI components that can be embedded in each lesson. Formative problem-solving tasks are embedded in each math unit and  lesson to support students with developing math fluency and content-based academic vocabulary.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teacher’s College staff developers provide literacy support throughout the school year. The K-2 staff developer is an ENL  specialist. All grade level teachers have common planning time to collaborate with ENL providers to support classroom  practices.  The school data specialist provides reports for administration and each classroom teacher for analysis. Professional  development is provided in mathematics, RTI, Pillars of Literacy, Fundations, Leveled literacy Instruction (LLI) and Maryann  Cucchiara methods for ELLs. ENL teachers attend professional development through BFC cohorts as well as using professional  literature to support inquiry-based instruction. A cohort of classroom teachers who support ENL students and ENL providers  attend workshops and in-school professional development to support the work of Maryann Cucchiara using close reading  within content areas of Science and Social studies, academic wordplay, and deconstructing juicy sentences. A school-wide  professional development plan supports professional development in cycles to ensure staff is provided with up to date  professional supports within literacy and mathematics. Classroom teachers and ENL providers are part of Professional Learning  communities to discuss student work and progress, noticing trends and student strengths and needs. Benchmark dates have  been included in each grade's curriculum calendar to ensure continuity and rigor for all students. The school's instructional  focus emphasizes how students use metacognition skills to support discussion within the content areas.  On-going professional  development opportunities are provided to the staff to support student discussion protocols that are age, grade and  appropriate for ELL students based on their progression levels.  A Core Professional Learning Team and Professional Learning  Communities meet to analyze school data, and identify a school-wide problem of practice as well as providing support to staff  in designing activities to support bridge to practice within their PLC Teams.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     Our school uses multiple data tools and assessments to determine students areas of strengths and needs. The EDAT Tool  provides our school with student's current progression levels based on the NYSESLAT. Student baseline data for Teachers  College Reading and Writing formative assessment data is measured through benchmarking. Compass Learning, Imagine  Learning and Go Math offer the opportunity for teachers to track their student's progress as they move through the respective  programs after taking a screener to set students on their individual learning paths. ENL staff look for progress on the NYSESLAT  from year to year, i.e. progression levels and trends. Staff assesses progress as well as gains on all NYS exams.  Summative  assessments in literacy include post assessments in both reading and writing in the form of reading tasks and On Demand  assessment in writing. Summative assessments of Speaking and Listening standards include culminating publishing  celebrations where students present their work and partake in academic discourse through peer feedback utilizing sentence  starters and discussion techniques such as Think-Pair-Share.  After analysis of our Summative assessment data, using the EDAT tool and Teachers College Reading and Writing benchmark  assessments we found that  73% are of our ELL students are below grade level standards in both reading and writing. There is  little progress in writing among ELL students based on both Summative and Formative assessments. Writing is the modality of  the NYSESLAT where students scored the least amount of points. After analysis of data, student reading levels and NYSESLAT  progression levels for students in grades 3-5 there are discrepancies and lack cohesion. We are providing students with small  group skills and strategy based lessons using programs, Teachers College Reading and Writing units of study, LLI-Leveled  Literacy Intervention program.  Reading and Writing are progress monitored through benchmarking. Programs such as LLI are  progress monitored on a weekly basis. In support of students increasing their reading levels and movement within progression  levels. Students need to have access to grade level curriculum to develop skills through close reading to support their  understanding of complex texts and academic vocabulary. ENL instruction and classroom instruction will provide students with  skills and strategies to support an increase in writing on all assessments. Content areas and mathematics summative  assessments include chapter tests, math tasks, unit tests, and projects. NYS State exam results are used to identify areas of  need in the grades K-5. Each of these grades is provided with an item skill analysis report to notice trends across grades and  come up with next steps.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?      Common planning time for teachers' is embedded into schedules to support data analysis. Grade meetings are held with the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      administration to review data to support students next steps and goals. Teachers meet at PLC's to develop plans and analyze  student data to inform their instruction.  A Core Professional Learning Team and Professional Learning Communities are in  place to guide school-wide decisions for professional development    Through Data Dive analysis and using the EDAT tool the ENL teachers, classroom teachers and administration review student  NYSESLAT and State Exam data to provide students with differentiated skill-based instruction. ELL students in need of  intervention are supported through our Title lll after-school programs and embedded RTI scheduled time based on specific  areas of need. We use data to look for trends, and selecting students who have made little to no progress within their  progression levels for the past two years, students who are at-risk for becoming long-term ELL's, ELL and SWD students who  are at- risk for not making progress on the progression levels and have scored a 1 or 2 on the state exams for the past two  years. Students who are at-risk who are in need of more intensive support are discussed with our PPT and SIT teams to discuss  student appropriate programs and supports.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      The EDAT tool analysis provides the school with NYSESLAT data and state exam data which is used to group students based on  their progression levels and performance. Student baseline content data is used to support small group tier 1 instruction.  Classroom teachers and ENL teachers analyze data collected to determine students in need of tier 1 interventions ENL teachers  and PPT members meet to discuss student progress and those in need of Tier III services. An RTI period has been embedded  into the school day to ensure all students including ELL students receive intensive small group instruction differentiated as  extra support that does not replace their service periods. Classroom teachers participation ENL cohort to support instructional  routines gained towards providing RTI interventions to all students based on good practices for ENL students. Student  NYSESLAT progression level data, Teachers College reading and writing data, content baseline assessments and state exam  results are used to recommend and provide RTI to ENL students for after-school programs and an ENL summer programs.RTI  tier 2 and 3 services are provided to ELL students through push-in and pull-out services.  RTI practices in place are small group  instruction, utilization of components of balanced literacy that include guided reading, phonics-based instruction, close  reading skills and shared reading.  Abstract language and concepts are introduced to students as they learn about their world  throughout all the grades. Key concepts and academic vocabulary are previewed, reviewed and revisited to reinforce student  learning.   Based on the data that has been gathered, instruction is scaffolded in the content areas for our ELL students. Teachers use  visuals, realia, interactive whiteboards and computer-based programs to assist with delivering instruction for assessments. ENL  teachers employ the use of strategies such as TPR, chants, rhymes, songs, guided dialogue, language frames, and language  games to support their instruction. Teachers use Speaking and Listening standards to support their planning, and instruction.  Teachers track student progress in 6-8 week cycles to determine progress and next steps for tiered intervention services.  Teachers support ELL students through crafting standard based language goals/objectives and planning for use of academic  language and discussion. Students have opportunities to learn about, study, and discuss the language of texts. Students use  text-based content learning in interactive experiences through labs, demonstrations, dramatic play, and debates that promote  academic conversational skills to enhance their reading and writing levels.             6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     NYS Exams such the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, state exam results and reading and writing benchmark data is used to evaluate  student progress and inform our ENL program for each progression level.  The results of these exams and assessments  analyzed to determine the areas of proficiency and areas of need.  They inform the specific skills that need to be targeted as  well as the instructional strategies that should be employed to support students in making progress.  Based on Student  baseline data and pre and post assessments for reading, writing and mathematics are consistently progress monitored through  benchmarking and through units of study to support our ENL integrated instruction and pull-out instruction based on student  progression levels. Our ENL teachers meet for common planning time and school professional time to discuss student progress  and next steps to inform their instruction.  ENL teachers utilize programs such as Imagine Learning, Leveled Literacy   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         Intervention (LLI),  Compass Learning, and Fundations to support students movement within progression levels, reading levels,  writing levels.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data reports are generated by teachers, administration, data specialist and ENL coordinator.  State testing, Imagine Learning,  Compass Learning, Reading and Writing benchmark data and Go Math data are analyzed by the ENL team and classroom  teachers, to evaluate student progress based on the ENL progression levels. ENL staff and teachers look for trends through  analysis of multi-sources of data to make informed decisions about students strengths needs and next steps to ensure students  progress through their current grade level standards. Classroom Teachers and ENL providers meet on common planning times  to create lessons and use co-planning techniques to support students language skills and content area comprehension.  Classroom teachers and ENL team meet with supervisors and PPT teams to share academic findings based on formative  assessments to develop plans for students not making academic progress or progress within learning the English language. ENL  PLC utilize data results to create differentiated lessons to support modifications, accommodations and scaffolds providing  students access to modified and providing students access to grade level curriculum. ENL PLC reviews student progress on a by  weekly process to inform their planning and practice. ENL staff progress monitors students on all proficiency level using  programs such as Fundations and LLI to ensure students are making adequate progress in their language skills development.  ENL staff and classroom teachers will use both formative and summative data analysis to determine necessary programs and  skills to meet the demands of individual ENL student learning needs.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     ENL instruction is delivered by Stand Alone ENL and Integrated ENL instruction models for the mandated minutes as  determined by the five proficiency levels; entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding.We organize  the ELL students into classes that contain heterogeneous/mixed proficiency ELLs and general education students that  are good models of the English language. The makeup for these classes is one-third to one-half ELLs and the  remainder of the class is comprised of fluent English speaking students. These class sizes initially are kept smaller than  the rest of the classes on the grade in an effort to afford a space for newly arrived students as well as to afford the  maximum amount of teacher-student time per child.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.       Our  Kindergarten Transitional Bilingual Education (Chinese) program provides students with ENL support within the  classroom setting.  Students are heterogeneously(mixed proficiency levels) placed based on their NYSITELL scores and  parent surveys. The teacher will use 70-80% of students native language and 20-30% in English during the instruction.  This percentage ratio will change over the course of the year, based on students and their progress.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     Each year the ENL Coordinator and ENL teachers create a comprehensive list of ELLs, including each student’s level of  proficiency. Programming is based on the NYS mandates of 360 minutes for Entering and Emerging student (180 minutes of  Stand Alone and 180 minutes of Integrated),  180 minutes for Transitioning and Expanding students (180 minutes of  Integrated), and 90 minutes for all Commanding students (90 minutes Integrated).  An ENL provider is assigned to each grade  level and programs are created to support ELA and content-based instruction.    ENL ELA  and Freestanding programs are provided from classroom teachers and our ENL providers, focusing on using  questioning and discussion into their daily instruction. ENL providers co-plan lessons to support students oral language skills to  promote high levels of student-led conversations. Classroom teachers and ENL staff work to support the five pillars of reading  instruction. Using Fundatons and LLI- Leveled Literacy Intervention programs to support students with phonemic awareness  and phonics instruction. Students are provided with accountable talk stems and sentence frames to increase their fluency. Our  classroom teachers and ENL providers support students literacy skills through guided reading and shared reading activities.  Our staff works with TC staff developers to promote academic discourse building their academic vocabulary and word-play  activities to support students through the writing units of study. Our Teachers and ENL Staff are involved with the work of  Mariann Cucchiara, examing complex texts through the close reading of juicy sentences across content areas such as Social  Studies and Science to support students levels of comprehension. Students will be provided content based supports through  our school-wide RTI embedded instructional period using multiple entry points providing students access to grade level texts.  Teachers support students HLA through the use of the translation of texts and questions as well as providing students with  bilingual dictionaries. Our TBE Kindergarten class provides students ELA instruction in English following the Teachers College  units of study for both Reading and Writing Workshops. The classroom teacher focuses instruction to support students phonics  and fluency skills through guided reading, Fundations and shared reading.The TBE classroom teacher provides two periods  each day to supporting students HLA within the content ares of Social Studies and Science. The classroom teacher supports  HLA and ELA providing both English and HLA throughout the classroom.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        The ENL curriculum is vertically aligned in grades K-5 based on the Next Generation Standards. Instruction in the Freestanding  ENL model is delivered in English. Students with Entering and Emerging proficiency levels receive sheltered instruction in the  target language. Fundation is used to support phonemic awareness, sight words and promote fluency. Shared reading, shared  writing and interactive writing are used to support language development. Oral language development is fostered through the  use of songs, chants and poems, speaking prompts and language frames.      Instruction in Integrated ENL is delivered in English. Students will have access to texts of increasing complexity building upon  the strategies learned in close reading. In content areas, such as Science, Math and Social Studies, ELLs are pre-taught  academic vocabulary through different types of word-play. Students will act it out, talk it out and use shades of meaning to  differentiate related words. Students will deconstruct and reconstruct sentences through close reading, using visuals and  realia.They are given supports such as bilingual dictionaries/glossaries and use of Chromebooks for vocabulary development  and comprehensible input.    Instruction in the Transitional Bilingual Kindergarten class will be in Chinese and English. Core content in the Bilingual Program  will be delivered using the Teachers College Workshop Model and Go Math Curriculum. Guided groups, strategy groups,  literacy centers, and independent center to support social and language developments.  Instruction will be delivered in both  Chinese and English in various ratios depending on students' needs and levels.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    In the TBE classroom, students are evaluated daily in their home language in the content areas. All ELL students are  administered the NYSETELL to determine their progression level based on the results.  Language paraprofessionals have been  assigned to several of our ELL students with special needs to ensure that they have access to the general education curriculum  after being evaluated in their home language. The paraprofessionals evaluate students' home language skills. Home language  development is assessed through the use of Imagine Learning. Students are assessed using benchmark data for reading,  writing, and mathematics through formative assessments. ELL students are assessed in their development of language skills  through analysis of screening tools and on-going data analysis of individual learning paths through Compass Learning and  Imagine Learning. The NYSESLAT and ELA are administered in English while the NYS Math and Science tests are offered in  alternate languages. When necessary, or beneficial to the students, they may have the assessments available to them in their  home language.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    There are currently no SIFE students enrolled at P.S.21. Should our population include SIFE students in the future, they will  receive additional instruction in the form of AIS/RTI provided through programs such as Fundations, LLI-Leveled Literacy  Intervention.Newcomers receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. They are placed in classrooms with teachers that  have experience working with ELLs. Classroom teachers collaborate with ENL teachers and attend professional development to  improve their ENL instructional approaches. ENL teachers push into these classrooms for mandated number of minutes each  week to work with classroom teachers and students. Teachers use methods such as Total Physical Response, the use of visuals  to access prior knowledge, peer tutoring, and multiple entry points to differentiate instruction. The students receive small  group instruction which is driven by the data attained through continuous assessment.Developing students receive 180  minutes of ENL instruction per week.  During this time, lessons are aligned to the Common Core State Standards and  differentiated to meet the needs of each student. Students, in small groups are provided with scaffolded lessons, multiple  entry points and pre-taught academic vocabulary.Long term ELLs will receive language and academic support from an AIS or  ENL teacher. They are also referred for professional evaluation for possible language processing deficits. Our current longterm  ELLs are students who receive Special Education services. Our ENL instruction is differentiated based on students needs and is  driven by the data available in these students’ IEPs.  In order to provide transitional support, ELLs who have reached English  proficiency receive  90 minutes of ENL instruction from ENL teachers. ENL teachers and classroom teachers are involved in  continuous discussions of students’ language needs. The TBE classroom teacher provides students with opportunities to read  literature in both English and their HL.                       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    The instructional strategies used by teachers of ELL-SWD,  provide access to academic content, by modeling good practices for  core curriculum areas, differentiated materials, small group instruction, peer tutoring and reading/writing partnerships. Close  reading and discussion protocols are used for support of student language skills. Teachers frontload vocabulary, use pictures,  repetition and visual cues to facilitate learning. In addition, grade level materials such as Wilson, Explode the Code, Fundations,  Touch Math, along with other compute- based programs are used to support phonemic awareness and language  development.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69        All educational decisions for our ELL-SWD's are made in conjunction with the special educators, the classroom teacher,  guidance counselor and SIT/PPT and LPT teams. Students are provided opportunities to learn with their non-disabled peers. If  students are making significant progress in their current services and placement, the SIT team can provide support to students  through flexible programming indicated on the student's IEP within the program recommendations as a LRE. ENL providers  continue to support students within the new recommended program both in ELA and content area instruction. All service  providers have open communication and access to the IEPs of students on their caseload. ENL teachers of ELL-SWD provide  both pull-out and push in services to support classroom content.  Students are provided with language acquisition, and reading  comprehension development through close-reading, shared reading and RTI based programs used to support students learning  needs and students IEP goals. Students IEP goals are progress monitored to ensure they receive proper instruction to meet  both their language and instructional content needs. ENL staff are part of the IEP process and support staff in the development  of student instructional yearly goals and monitoring of student assessment results.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All AIS/RTI services offered during the school day and afterschool are delivered in English.  There is currently one Academic  Intervention Specialist, one IEP teacher and a SETSS provider that offer support for our students.  ENL teachers also provide RTI  services to ELL students who are identified in need of AIS are scheduled into programs that support standard-based targeted  instruction as a are pullout program using small group instruction.All content area tier 1 strategies are provided by the  classroom teacher for all students. Within the classroom through small group instruction and individual conferences utilizing  the Teacher's College Workshop model, the work of Maryann Cucchiara, reading complex texts through close reading within  Science and Social Studies content areas, deconstructing juicy sentences, academic word-play. Compass learning, LLI, guided  reading lessons and GoMath programs support tier 1 interventions. Students are provided with support in language aquisition  and individual language goals. ELL students in need of tier 2 and tier 3 are serviced by out of the classroom providers utilizing  programs as well as double-dose of Fundations, LLI, small group skill and strategy based lessons as well as guided reading and  shared reading for 6-8 week cycle and are progressed monitored on both daily and weekly. ELL students are provided are  provided HLA supports through use of translated exams, lessons, questions, and charts. Students are provided with bilingual  dictionaries to support content-based academic vocabulary understanding and usage.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       After analyzing the data using the EDAT tool to compare NYSESLAT and state exam scores, reading and writing benchmark  data and Go Math data we found that there are 79 students that have made no progress within their progression levels  through grades 1-5. We noticed a trend between students who have stayed on the Expanding level for two years have  discrepancies within their reading and writing levels, students are below the grade level standard. Our students in grades 3-5  who have made little no progress on the NYSESLAT and scored a level 1 or 2 on the state exams are at-risk for becoming  longterm ELL's. Our ENL SWD's students are at great risk not making progress on the NYSESLAT, state-exams and reading and  writing data.    Based on these results and trends we are implementing cycles of targeted instruction within the Title III after school program.  A cohort of teachers implement the work of Maryann Cucchiara, supporting close reading skills within the content areas of  Science and Social Studies with the use of academic word play and deconstructing juicy sentences. Compass Learning  instructional time is provided for students opportunity to continue on their individual learning path.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs?

Students can  access math support through Think Central. Students have access to Imagine Learning, a computer based literacy program for  ELL students and struggling students. This leveled program places and tracks students as they progress in their literacy skills.  Targeted areas are identified, calling attention to areas where the students need extra support. Students regularly use mobile  computer labs, Chromebooks and iPads to access technology for multiple assignments in the classroom.The TCRWP allows  teachers to use a variety of materials to meet the needs of their students for literacy instruction in planned units of study.  Additionally, teachers have access to the LLI program, which is used with small groups of students for guided reading. The  Fundations program and all its components are used for phonics instruction in the early grades and for entering ELLs to build  early language skills. ELL students have access to a library of leveled books in English as well as a library containing bilingual  books.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Newly arrived and entering level students are partnered with buddy students who help to support the home language for  these students while transitioning to English. Many of our staff members speak multiple languages and language  paraprofessionals offer home language support to identified students. Teachers provide students access to the curriculum  supporting translation into their native languages. ELL students have access to a library of leveled books in English as well as a  library containing books in other languages. ENL programs support students home language through the use of translated  documents and content area instruction and assessments provided to the students to support language translation needs.  Classrooms are supported with both words and pictures to support students English language development. Students are  assessed using grade level reading and writing benchmark assessments, and grade-appropriate content area formative  assessments. Our TBE program provides students opportunities to have ELA instruction and vocabulary work translated both in  English and their home language. Classrooms are labeled in both the home language and English language. Home language  support is provided through two periods each day within content area instruction.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Student age and grade levels are accurately established at registration, by checking the student's date of birth and education  history. When available, past report cards and academic reports are accepted and reviewed by the LPT team in order to  accurately place students in age-appropriate grades. The ENL Coordinator and/or the pupil personnel secretary informs the  ENL service providers, classroom teachers and any other previously mandated outside service provider of any newly admitted  student who should be added to their roster.  All students are provided with age and grade level curriculum materials for all  content area subjects. Classroom teachers and ENL staff provide appropriate progression level supports to ensure students are  provided with scaffolds, allowing access to the grade level curriculum. ENL staff provide language support to students and  provide intensive literacy skills and strategies to improve students reading levels based on their reading level assessments.  Students are matched to their current reading levels while being exposed to grade level units of study. Students are provided  with scaffolds and accommodations of translated documents and texts to support their content area learning and language  development.       15.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Swirsky, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 21 Q- Edward Hart                                                                              School DBN: 25Q021  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration, the ENL Coordinator, assess home language and assigns the OTELE code on the HLIS form. This  data is entered into ATS by the secretary. Our secretary downloads the RHLA and the RPOB reports from ATS to  identify the written translation and oral interpretation needs of our parents. This report is distributed to our ENL  teachers and our Parent Coordinator, who keeps an updated list for distribution of materials, flyers and  information to our parents in the family room. The school's Parent Coordinator also conducts a survey with the  classroom teachers and gathers information regarding student language and home language needs.
