This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 131 Mission Statement   Section 4: CEP Overview      We, the school community, in a strong collaboration with parents and community, believe that all students can meet  high standards of excellence within a safe and nurturing environment. We are committed to rigorous instructional  programs in Literacy, Mathematics, Science and Technology and engaging Professional Development which address  the cognitive, social and creative growth of our students. We will pursue models of standards-based instructional  programs which provide opportunities for all students to be active learners within learner centered classrooms. Our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      mission is to set forth high standards with clear expectations which will enable all students and teachers, in  partnership with parents, to become lifelong learners, capable of meeting the challenges of our ever changing  technological society.   Our motto is “PS 131 where students acquire the knowledge, the voice and the conviction to live out their dreams.”  This past year we have added as a motto for students “I believe in myself, I know I can do it.” These speak to the belief  system that drives our passion and insatiable desire to have students create dreams for the rest of their lives and  acquire the skills and motivation to fulfill them.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 131 is a community school that serves 1050 students. We will have two full day pre k classes. . In Kindergarten we  have 6 classes, 6 classes in grade 1, 6 classes in grade 2, 6 classes in grade 3, 6 classes in grade 4 and now 6 classes in  grade 5. There are 2 ICT classes in grades 1 through 5 and one ICT in K . We will have three self contained classes; in  grades K/1, 2/3 and an upper grade 4 and 5.   We have partnerships that enhance our academic and artistic skills. Teachers College is our partner in literacy.  Aussies, Exemplars, Engage NY, Goldmansour and representatives from NCTEM support our mathematics program.  The arts are the vehicles we use to provide other venues for expression. Our art partners are: Studio in a School,  Together in Dance, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music,Algebra4All, robotics and MOMA.         PS 131 won the UFT partnership award in 2012. We believe that it Is our mission to support all students. The only way  this works is when administration and teachers work together towards this goal. It's administrations job is to provide  support and tools for teachers so that they can meet the needs of our students. We listen to each other and work  collaboratively.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have historically made progress with the lowest third in all subject areas. We are very proud of serving our  students with special needs. This is our moral imperative. Our number of ELLs is continuously growing. When given  time in our academic institution these students make significant progress. Lately, students are arriving later in the  school year and in the upper grades. After a year and a day they are tested in ELA.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In mathematics we went from 44.6% proficiency to 53% proficiency. The average proficiency in math was 2.734 and  now is 3.05. We began a new math program from the state , Engage NY. This was a struggle for our teachers to learn  but they did. This program makes students make their thinking and problem solving visible. This has also increased  academic vocabulary and excited students about math. In 2018-2019 we are continuing to participate in the Algebra  for all pilot. Our fifth graders will departmentalize and two teachers will be trained in this.   Last year we have made the most progress and we are most proud of Collaborative Teachers. Teachers are learning  from teachers. They have developed and delivered their own professional development. Inquiry teams, vertical and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      horizontal teams as well as study groups have emerged. They have totally taken over their own learning. The respect  and trust that they have for administration and each other is over whelming. Administrators are members of their  learning teams as well. We provide the support to ensure that their learning is uninterrupted. Teacher facilitate  groups and provide workshops for one another. Parent engagement opportunities enhanced the home school  connection. Parents came to school and actually asked for workshops on upcoming work so that they would be  prepared to assist their children at home. Parents were also included in teacher professional development so they  were learning alongside teachers.   Next year we will need to continue to work on rigorous instruction. We looked for ways and studied as a school ways  to make our instruction better. Our curriculum is totally aligned to the Common Core standards but as educators  many teachers support students so much that when asked to do things on their own it is a little challenging. This year  we focused on ELLs and special need students. Students with Autism are included in our general education classes.  The school will hire personnel that have special training in Autism. Next year we will focus on meeting the needs of  special education students.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K131   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   999   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The curriculum that we use is continuously being adapted to meet the needs of our students. We use Teachers’  College units in reading and writing along with Fundations and Essentials in word work. In mathematics we utilize the  state curriculum of Engage NY along with Performance based assessments which include Exemplars. All of these  curriculum are aligned to the CCSS. These particular curriculums were chosen based on the needs of students as  demonstrated by data. The Reading and Writing project is focused on writing and when you look at ELA and NYSESLAT  data you see that our lowest scores are in the writing components. Word work that is focused on language acquisition  and vocabulary is needed to address the ELLs. Inquiry work on rigor and student engagement enhances the  curriculum. On our latest Quality Review a focus area for PS 131 was rigor. One of our priorities based on inquiry work  is on questioning and engagement. After observing students during independent work time we found that many  students were not engaged the entire reading time. Our workshop model dedicates anywhere from twenty to twenty  five minutes spent on independent work time. Having students spend this much time not fully engaged is distressing.  We will focus on ensuring engagement. Collaborative teachers working together on rigor will increase student  achievement. Many of the inquiry projects addressed this area. The Danielson Framework has clearly shown that as a  school we need to work on questioning. A school wide study on questioning is underway. After reviewing teacher  observations it is clear that this is still an area of need.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Every June new families of preschool children are invited to school. They meet with support staff as well as the  teachers and para professionals in the program. They visit the classrooms and are given a booklet of ways to prepare  their children for pre k. When children arrive in September, allowances are made for students that are having  adjustment issues; parents stay, guidance counselor meets them at door, etc. Parent and child literacy sessions are  planned as monthly activities. This is where parents read along with their child and they learn what questions to ask.  The book is then sent home for re reads. There will be an F Status administrator assigned to Pre K who has experience  in Pre K. She will provide on-site professional development and outline planning using Pre K resources provided by the  DOE. A social worker will provide early intervention and social/emotional support to studfents and families.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     We work closely with Aussie staff developer in mathematics that works with teachers along with the coach that they  look at assessments. Teachers then provide input and meet with the cabinet. Different resources are looked at when  deciding or creating assessments. The literacy coach (ela) provides different assessments and then gets teacher input  that is brought to administration. Decisions on which assessments are also flexible. We have and will continue to  make adjustments to assessments as teacher use them, analyze and then plan accordingly. Systems have been set up  to monitor progress in both ela and mathematics. Professional development is provided to analyze results of  assessments and then plan for small group instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 131, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 131 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (SEA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 131, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

This information is evidenced in data taken from both  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores for our school in the 2017-2018 school year. Some of them  are newcomers that have little prior formal education. ELLs must take both the ELA and  Mathematics exams after one year in the U.S. In grade 3 there are  61 ELLs  and only 12 of them  met standards. In grade 4 there are 36 ELLs and only 8 met standards. In grade 5 there are  37  ELLs and only 4 met standards. This is a total of 110 ELLs below standards. An after school  program that supports all of these students in ELA and Mathematics , will give academics  preparation for the state exams and their regular classroom work. Students in grade 3 through 5  that meet the above mentioned criteria will be the targeted subgroup. This after school program  will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30through 4:30 PM. Students will receive  instruction in ELA on Wednesdays and instruction in Mathematics on Thursdays. The program  will run from November through May. The subgroup to be serviced are Entering, Emerging and  Transitioning.  There will be additional Saturday classes during March and April that will  provide test preparation for the NYSESLAT. All subgroups will be serviced on Saturdays. The  language of instruction will be in English only. There will be six teachers. Three teachers are  certified bilingual teachers and three teachers are certified ENL teachers. The students will be  grouped by grade and proficiency level when possible. There will be approximately 15 students  per one teacher. The ELA materials will be Oxford Content Area Picture Dictionaries,  workbooks and accompanying readers (all appropriate to each group's literacy and grade levels).  This program has proved to support learning language structure and vocabulary with ELLs.  These materials provide  basic English language skills and vocabulary that are  sometimes difficult to incorporate into regular classroom instruction.  Students will be reading  common text with vocabulary support, writing about these texts and then sharing and discussing  their learning. This year the program utilized New York State Progress Mathematics edition.  However, we are currently researching alternatives to use as well. Student attendance will be  taken each session and kept by the program coordinator. The instructional materials are different  than daily classroom materials. Parent notifications will be issued in the preferred language noted  by the parent on the Home Language Survey. Parent workshops will provide the home school  support.

The purpose of these workshops will be to provide fidelity to the  curriculum/standards and continuity in instruction throughout the year. The workshops will be  two hours in length. Attendance will be taken at each meeting. These, as well as, agendas and  meeting materials will be kept by the program coordinator. One hour will be for teacher team  meetings, where they will plan rigorous lessons that are Common Core aligned. The teachers will  focus on scaffolds and language structures. During the other hour, there will be training on the  New Language Progressions and their use in planning with the Oxford ELA materials as well as  the mathematics materials. There will also be training on NYSESLAT preparation and use of  prep materials. Professional development  schedule is as  follows:                                                                                                                                  November - Identifying the levels and needs of students/ Planning  with Oxford  materials                                      December - New Language Progressions (Overview)/ Planning with math material                    January -  New Language Progressions and ELA/ Progress update (ELA) and future  planning                    February - New Language Progressions and Math/ Progress update (math) and future  planning                    March - NYSESLAT (overview)/ Planning with Finish Line Materials                    April - NYSESLAT (listening and speaking)/ Progress update (NYSESLAT  preparation ) and future planning                    May - NYSESLAT (writing - short and extended responses)/ Progress update (math)  and future planning    This professional development will provide continuity and focus in the learning of the students.  It will help teachers to support their ongoing needs in the mainstream classroom in both ELA and  Mathematics. The PD providers will be ENL teachers from the school which are all certified in  ENL.

Giving the parents on going skills that they can  use throughout their daily interactions with their children, will allow them to support the learning  whenever they are able to. Parents will be provided with various workshops on how to support  their children at home, in particular preparing for standardized tests and enhancement activities  that promote language and math skills. There will also be sessions to familiarize parents of  newcomers with NYC cultural systems.  Workshops will be provided after-school and on  Saturdays.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use Fountas & Pinnell Running Records- administered several times per year; informal Running Records; TC-Writing-on- Demand Assessments, administered-pre and post each unit of writing, using a CCSS aligned rubric; math module specific, pre  and post module assessments . Current NYSESLAT results indicate that ELLs score lower, across grades, on the writing section.  Prompted, texted based informational writing presents a challenge for our ELL students.  Information obtained determines the  composition and specific skills taught in flexible, small groups for reading/writing, math instruction.  Units of study in both  classroom and ESL groups have been modified to address this need, giving students the opportunity to practice answering  these types of questions.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Every student is assesed in Fountas & Pinnell in September and periodically throughout the year. Extra preperation periods will  be provided if necessary to complete this.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELL progress is evaluated using Running Record levels, using a CCSS aligned benchmark rubric; growth in writing is meaured  through writing-on-demand pieces graded with a CCSS rubric; growth in math is measured by pre and post unit tests within  CCSS math curriculum -EngageNY. NYSESLAT; ELA; State Math Test are also used to measure growth.  ESL teacher observations  and teacher made assessments. Last available AYP data indicates that our ELL students met AYP targets in ELA, math and  science.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Title 111 after school program will target these students. The afterschool program will meet Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Students will be taught by ENL and/or bilingual teachers.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school places a great deal of emphasis on TIER 1 instruction, investing considerable resourses [time; money] focusing on  rigorous, standards based, professional development for ALL pedagogues, on the needs of ELLs and students with disabilities;  close supervision/feedback cycles; on-going teacher/supervisor monitoring and conversations about assessment results and  implications for instruction.   Data gathered through on-going monitoring and assessments [Running Records; Writing-on- Demand; math tests; individual student/teacher conferences] is used to determine TIER 2 instruction, which is provided in  flexible, small groups by classroom teachers and specialists. TIER 3 instruction is offered through our Academic Intervention  Program and in small groups, through cycles of very targeted instruction, by out-of-classroom pedagogues.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In all grades students move out of the entering, emerging levels quickly [within the first two years], and remain in the  transitioning and expanding levels for at least two years.   New admit students, across all grades levels, score predominantly at  the entering and emerging levels, i.e. K=49.5%; Gr. nmlk 1=71.4%; Gr.2-5=100%. These students are provided with more time  in ENL instruction, as per P 154 and instruction focused on learning the basic, begginner level vocabulary [TIER I] and langauge  structures to be able to communicate effectively in all modalities.  NYSESLAT scores reveal that 53. 7% of students scored at  the expanding level. This is consistent across grades and sub-groups, i.e. boys, girls, Hispanic, Asian. Students scoring at the  transitioning and expanding levels are provided a combination of direct ENL instruction and content area instruction, with a  focus on TIER II and III vocabulary and the use of more complex sentences across all four modalities.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   All teachers will be made aware of this data. Adjustments will be made accordingly to programs with the support of the school  assistant principal. Classroom teachers will be notified via reports during a Monday professional development session.All  teachers will be made aware of this data.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   There is a pull-out/push-in program in all grades. Integrated ESL is delivered during push-in hours and stand-alone ESL  is delivered during pull-out hours. Kindergarten is exclusively a push-in program due to developmental need. Groups  are organized by grade and are homogeneously grouped by proficiency level.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?             The amount of ENL instruction to each proficiency level is devlivered in the following time allocations: Entering=360  mins.= 1 unit [180 min.] stand-alone ENL mins. & 1 unit [180 min] integrated ENL mins. Emerging= 360 mins. =1 unit [180 min]  integrated & 1 unit [180 mins] stand alone. Transitioning= 180 mins.= .5 units [90 mins] stand alone & .5 units [90 mins]  integrated. Advanced=180 mins.=1 unit [180 mins] integrated; commanding= 90 mins= .5 units [90 mins.] integrated. All pull- out/push-in teachers have lists and schedules that track each student and the number of minutes of ENL instruction they  receive.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is delivered in English only during push-in hours (by out-of-classroom ENL teachers) or by the classroom teacher  in the self-contained ENL or bilingual classes.  ENL teachers have developed social studies units of study following the scope  and sequence for the grade and aligning to Common Core Standards. Trade books, graphic organizers, dictionaries, conten  area magazines, picture cards, langague games are used.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      New admits are tested with NYSITELL and wherever necessary with Spanish LAB-R. Native informal assessments- teacher/student conferences-to determine content understanding, are conducted throughout the year by teachers in the  Transitional Bilingual classes.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for ALL [including ELL] students within the context of every classroom through the use of small  groups, individual conferring and planning whole group lessons that provide access to the content through modeling, charts,  visuals, technology, drama.  Academic Intervention Services [AIS] two afternoons per week, after school, for all  students[including ELLs] performing below grade level in reading and math. Test taking strategies and practice particular to  each standarized test [ELA, math, social Studies, science, NYSESLAT] is offered on Saturdays [Saturday Scholars] and made  available to all students in Grades 1-5 who will be taking the particular test.          The SIFE population at P.S.131K is very small, i.e. 3 students , from Grades 3-5. In addition to participating in Beginner ESL  groups, a SIFE may be placed in a different grade class for content area lesson, i.e. a different grade for phonics or math   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      instruction. These arrangement are made on a student-by-student basis, determined by the academic, social, emotional needs  of the particular students.             In addtion to all the supports outlined above, ELL students enrolled for less than three years [Newcomers] participate in a  Title III, afterschool program to support language acquisition and development in reading, writing and math. Beginner ESL  instruction also incorporates a great deal of singing and chanting, use of TPR, drama and lots of enlarged or shared texts  [Shared Reading].           In addtion to all the supports outlined above, ESL instruction for ELL students receiving services for 4 or more years  [Developing], is provided with a concentrated focus on the development of language, reading and writing skills in the content  area, building of TIER 2 and content area vocabulary. Students not performing at grade level , may also be recommended to  receive additional instruction from the Academic Intervention Teacher.           The progress of ELL students receiving services for 5 or more years [Long Term] is discussed by our  Pupil Personnel Team  to determine if additional support services need to be put in place, i.e. At-Risk Resource Room.            Newly proficient [Former] ELLs continue to receive support through ENL instruction and all services available to non-ELL  students.   Testing modifications: ELLs and former ELLs are tested in separate locations and given time and a half.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     Because at P.S.131K literacy instruction is delivered as an Apprentice Model of instruction within a Balanced Literacy  Framework, a great amount of time is given to imploying the instructional/assessment strategies, listed below, to allow all  students, and especially ELLs and students with disabilities access to academic content , acceleration of English language  development.  *Extensive assessments in:   Reading [administration of periodic Running Records] to determine each student's instructional and independent reading  levels, for placement in appropriate reading groups.  Writing-requiring pre and post writing unit 'Writing-on Demand" to determine growth within a unit, across several months and  relation to standards based rubrics, i.e. Teachers' College Continuum of Writing Development [for narrative and for non- narrative writing].   Pre and post math tests for each unit to determine what needs to be taught and how much was learned througout the unit.   *Instructional strategies/methods, as listed above in reponses througout this section, include teacher explicit modelling of  small tasks; using visual and auditory aids to meet the different learning modality needs of students; lots of modeling and  explicit instruction in the use of processes, language patterns and vocabulary that are needed to participate in content area  activities and access information.   Extensive monitoring for progress allows teachers to target each ELL student's proficiency within each modality, thus working  within each students Zone of Proximal Development, promoting accelerated Englilsh language acquisition.     Native Language materials used: content area books; fiction books; dictionaries; charts.  Instructional strategies for ELL-SWDs  include use of hands-on materials, TPR, drama, photographs; triad partner talk; language  experience approach; sentence prompts; graphic organizers, etc.  Ensuring that ELL-SWDs with IEP mandates receive appropriate ESL or bilingual instruction: IEP teacher reviews all IEPs and  communicates with each classroom teacher and the ENL Coordinator communicating all IEP mandates. ENL Coordinator  ensures that all relevant pedagogues are informed and that all services are put in place.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Once a student is evaluated, the School Assessment Team, i.e. school psychologist; social worker, etc. recommend the least  restrictive environment for each student. ICT and self-contained special education classes are part of all school wide activities,  thus maximizing the time spent with non-special education students. The criteria for determining placement in an ICT class is  determined by the School Assessment Team and based on results of all educational testing.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Determination of whether an ELL student is in need of intervention services is based on performance on standarized tests, i.e.  ELA, math, periodic assessments, and classroom work, teacher observations and formative assessments, i.e. pre & post math  tests, writing-on-demand pieces, Running Records. While being a member of a particular ELL sub-group may contribute to the  need for intervention, the determining factor for whether a student is in need of intervention services is a student's academic  performance and social adjustment. As listed above, intervention may take many different or multiple forms, dependent on  student need, i.e. AIS afterschool; Reading Recovery [Grade 1]; Lower or Upper Grade Literacy Intervention Group; placement  in another grade for instruction in a particular content area; At-Risk Resource Room instruction; small group or individual  counseling. At-risk intervention services are offered in English, with the support of instructional aids, as needed. Mandated  intervention services are provided in the language indicated on the individual student's IEP. Targeted students in mathematics  and literacy use Kaplan and Benchmarks for intervention.   Social Studies targeted intervention=national Geographic. Science  targeted intervention=National Geographic.   Our Transitional Bilingual programs exists in Kindergarten only, teaching social studies in the native language.  We do not  provide a targeted intervention program for Kindergarten in social studies. Therefore there is no targeted intervention  program in the native language.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We began conducting a mini- orientation course [touring the school, getting to know school personnel, quickly learning  essential survival phrases,  how to make friends] for beginner newcomers who speak no English.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No program or service will be discontinued.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Most students at P.S.131K are presently ELLs or Former ELLs. ALL programs, during or after school or on Saturday [as described  in answers to questions in this section above] and all instructional materials, supports are available to ELLs and are put in place  specifically to meet the needs of ELL students. ELLs are invited to attend all programs just like all other students at PS 131 are  invited. They are not excluded. Letters describing the programs, with a parental choice tear-off [for response] is sent home to  ALL students.  Funding for most programs after school and Saturdays are Title I, Contract for Excellence, or Fair Student  Funding. Title III funds are specific for  an afterschool program for a limitted number of ELLs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classrooms are print rich and contain word walls, content area vocabulary charts, extensive leveled, genre and topic based  libraries and reference books/dictionaries in English and in native languages, where appropriate. Strategy, Process and Content  Charts are  created by teachers, with and for students, as instructional aids and supports used during lessons and independent  worktime. Digital & audio/visual media are available in all classrooms for all students to better communicate; develop/enrich  language and conceptual development, i.e. Listening Centers; Whisper Phones; Smart Boards [Grades 2-5]; Mobile Laptop  Centers [Grades 2-5]; desktop computers [all classrooms];  on-line resource subscriptions [RAZ Kids; iExcel; Brainpop; Brainpop  Jr.; Brainpop Espanol- available to students/parents from home as well]; Discovery Education United Streaming; World Book  Encyclopedia. Also available in all classrooms are  an extensive assortment and variety of math manipulatives for hands-on  exploration. A science lab room contains science materials [for exploration and experimentation] and extensive science  libraries aligned with New York State science curriculum outline. Extensive content area libraries can be found in all  classrooms.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     Native language support is delivered in the following manner:          Transitional Bilingual classes follow a 70:30 model [70% English , 30 % Spanish or Chinese].              Content area lessons [Reading, Writing, S.S., Science] are conducted with a Preview'Review Model [Freeman &  Freeman] as follows:              Preview of lesson [5mins]- in native language; Mini-lesson- [10-15 mins.]- in English; Independent Worktime- students  practice                independently while the teacher confers with individual students in whichever language will most support the individual  student's              development. Teacher also conducts small group instruction in English, with native language supports [preview &  review] as              necessary [25 mins.]; Share- in English [5mins]; Review -in native language [5 mins.]. At least one Read Aloud each day is  conducted              in the native language.          ESL instruction is offered in English, with some native language support, when appropriate/needed.   Beginner students that can read and write in their native language are encouraged to do so.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    On-going, systematic, periodic assessments ensure that ELLs, SWD, ELL-SWD; non-ELLs are placed in instructionally appropriate  groups and do not limit them to groupings determined by age.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All classrooms are print rich and contain word walls, content area vocabulary charts, extensive leveled, genre and topic based  libraries and reference books/dictionaries in English and in native languages, where appropriate. Strategy, Process and Content  Charts are  created by teachers, with and for students, as instructional aids and supports used during lessons and independent  worktime. Digital & audio/visual media are available in all classrooms for all students to better communicate; develop/enrich  language and conceptual development, i.e. Listening Centers; Whisper Phones; Smart Boards [Grades 2-5]; Mobile Laptop  Centers [Grades 2-5]; desktop computers [all classrooms];  on-line resource subscriptions [RAZ Kids; iExcel; Brainpop; Brainpop  Jr.; Brainpop Espanol- available to students/parents from home as well]; Discovery Education United Streaming; World Book  Encyclopedia. Also available in all classrooms are  an extensive assortment and variety of math manipulatives for hands-on  exploration. A science lab room contains science materials [for exploration and experimentation] and extensive science  libraries aligned with New York State science curriculum outline. Extensive content area libraries can be found in all  classrooms.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs, Grades 1-5 [and many in PreK and Kindergarten] are registered after the beginning of school, so we  presently do not offer activities for newly enrolled ELLs in Grade 1-5 BEFORE the start of the school year. We do offer parent  orientation meetings and school tours for newly enrolled PreK and Kindergarten students [including ELLs and their families] in  June of the year before they start school. Spanish, Chinese and Bengali [when available] translations are offered at these  orientation meetings and tours. These orientations include introduction to key school personnel; descriptions of programs  offered to all different student populations in the school, ELL identification process and placement, what to expect the first few  days of school, how to build anticipation and excitement for school with the PreK and Kindergarten student througout the  summer; how to deal with separation anxiety; visits to classrooms across the grades and Q & A sessions, with the  Princiap,  Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator, Guidance Counselor.                 17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         We are an elementary school. Students are not offered electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided for all pedogogues by an AUSSIE staff developer for math and by Teacher's College staff  developers for literacy. Administrators, coaches and teachers conduct professional development for staff members every  Monday afternoon from 2:30 to 3:50 p.m.  All Faculty Conferences are planned as opportunities for the teaching staff to learn  from one another. The focus of PD this year is "How to provide cognitively rigorous instruction for all students?"

All  staff members keep sign-in sheets log-in parent attendance at group and individual meetings. Annual individual meetings with  ELL parents, as per CR-Part 154 will be conducted during the Tuesday parent meeting time. Teachers will log each individual  meeting with a sig-in sheet. At ALL meetings translations are provided in the preferred parental language.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.    At P.S.131K parents are involved in a variety of ways: PTA; School Leadership Team. Parents attend curriculum information  meetings in their children's clasrooms, at the beginning of each year. Workshops are arranged by the Parent Coordinator,  offered by outside organizations and P.S.131K staff, on working with students at home, nutrition, other topics of interest to  parents. Parents attend Saturday information workshops to become better acquainted with the CCSS,  standarized tests  students take and workshops conducted by our guidance counselor on parenting issues. Through our Title III Grant parents  attend instructional meetings on NYSESLAT and at times take trips to cultural institutions, led by ESL teachers. Parent  Coordinator has developed a relationship with the librarian in our local public library. Last year she began, and will continue to  extend this year, parent trips to the library to help our ELL parents become confortable and familiar with the library, in order to  encourage use during non-school hours, with their children.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.131K                                                                              School DBN: 15K131  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
