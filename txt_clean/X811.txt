This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school’s mission statement speaks volumes about our core beliefs and practices that form our community and  drive our experience to meet the needs of our diverse student population. At P.S. 811X, we serve students with an  array of cognitive and physical disabilities, whose diverse learning needs require highly purposeful and adaptive  curriculum to meet their post-secondary and transitional goals in order to achieve greater success and independence  in life. Our school serves over 640 students with disabilities (the vast majority of which participate in alternate  assessment) from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, to which 40.19 percent of our student body consists of  students with limited English proficiency. Through understanding the individual needs of our students as it relates to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      their transitional needs, we have developed a program that combines academic rigor with community building and  experiences in order to foster the development of our student needs so that we can afford them the best post- secondary outcomes.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   As a learning community, curriculum refinements are done each week during Collaborative Teacher Teams (CTT) and  Instructional Teacher Teams (ITT) meetings and through our Instructional and Administrative cabinet meetings. All  sessions focus on looking at student work utilizing a specific protocol. Teams provide suggestions for modifications to  instruction/curriculum based on student needs. Each collaborative inquiry team has a focus/standard and monitored  on an ongoing basis. Teachers have input in the curriculum writing process and have been afforded a multitude of  resources for implementation, including iPads for instructional use and communication, interactive white boards for  all classrooms, our Live Binder website, ReThink and subscriptions to online eBooks, MyOn, Flocabulary, Vital  Thirteen, NYC Public Library and more.      In addition to purposeful and rigorous academic practices, the program at P.S. 811X provides our students with vital  post-secondary training in functional life-skills and job preparedness so that they may transition into their  communities at large ready to face the challenges and demands of daily life. To do so, a whole community approach is  taken toward the assessing of student skills, identification of needs, and placement within training programs and  opportunities aligned toward post-secondary student outcomes. Our process begins through the identification of  student and parent post-secondary outcome concerns through Level 1 surveys and interview, assessment of baseline  academic, social-emotional, vocational (community and employment), and gross and fine physical skills, which are  translated into long-term and short term benchmark goals for student achievement. Through a community effort, we  involve all stakeholders in the creation of student’s individualized program. To develop student skill sets to meet their  post-secondary goals, students’ academic foci are coupled with practical community enrichment experiences and  community service projects to foster the translation of academic to essential life understandings. Students  additionally develop toward their post-secondary outcomes through vocational job training internships within the  school community as well as through partnerships with various private local businesses, non-profit organizations, and  governmental institutions. Our department of transition additionally works closely with families, governmental  agencies, students, and educational staff to ensure appropriate placement following graduation within pre- employment and training programs. The program at P.S. 811X involves the whole school community in the design,  instruction, and transitional placement of each student in order to promote post-secondary successes and student  achievement beyond graduation.      We have made great strides in improving our practices as they relate to the Six Elements of the Framework for Great  Schools. With respect to rigorous instruction, we have set into place high expectations for teachers concerning  curriculum implementation and have provided frameworks for adapting the demands of higher order thinking skills  and higher complexity skills as they relate to instruction as identified during our Quality Review in March of 2016 in  which we received a Well Developed in all components of the instructional core 1.1, 1.2 and 2.2. Student goals have  been streamlined into the assessment process with respects to curriculum, Individual Education Plans (IEPs), and by  using the highest complexity tasks associated with various English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. In doing so,  students engage in project based learning experiences for each instructional unit that is aligned to their individual  needs and adaptive to their primary means of communication. We have additionally made tremendous strides in our  efforts to be a supportive environment for our students. We have revamped our Positive Behavior Intervention  System (PBIS) to include several elements that go beyond the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) basics of that  program to integrate SEL components into our school community. Primarily, we have incorporated a program to  highlight positive behaviors of students throughout the building daily in a program called “Gotcha”. We have  additionally instilled several PBIS and SEL programs to promote community, problem solving, and team building   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      principals amongst our students including Girls and Boys Clubs, Dance Squad, Basketball Teams (mobile as well as  wheelchair), Horticulture Club, Performance Choir, and several vocational internships to challenge our students and  build a safe and caring environment which earned the school a well -developed in School Culture, 3.4. A third area we  have developed well over the past year with respects to the Framework for Great Schools is Collaborative Teachers.  We support our teachers through collaborative professional development groups and professional learning  communities focused on addressing their needs as they pertain to instruction and student achievement outcomes  concerning both curriculum and pedagogy on a weekly basis as well as allot time for teachers to work within their  instructional teacher teams to share data and concerns over the needs of individual students. In doing so, teachers  work toward improvement of pedagogy collaboratively three times a week with a separate focus for each meeting  within different cohorts. In this way we build a strong community of professionals committed to self and school-wide  improvement of practice. We additionally worked toward development of family and community ties through hosting  several district functions and information sessions for parents and guardians. In addition providing several in-house  professional development opportunities and workshops for parents and guardians focused on transition, promotion  of academic success, meeting physical needs of children, etc. to empower families. provide vital information and  academic support to empower parents and families. We now have incorporated "Parent Fun Days" into our yearly  events calendar. Once a month, parents are invited to attend fun activities such as Tea and Paint, Arts and Crafts,  Yoga and Zumba classes.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At P.S.811X, it is our philosophy that all children have a boundless capacity for learning. We assert that all children are  entitled to appropriate, authentic and stimulating learning experiences that will maximize their quality of life. We are  committed to establishing our school as a beacon of leadership in the community through sound educational  practices that foster student independence and that will facilitate community integration.   We are a special education school with several programs that serve students with a wide spectrum of physical and  cognitive disabilities. We provide services for students with Autism, learning disabilities, mental retardation, and  multiple disabilities. To best serve our students we adhere to an educational model that is founded upon a rigorous  functional academic curriculum. We create learning experiences that empower our students to make choices and  experience the outcomes that they desire.    We continue to accomplish our goals by employing a faculty of highly qualified professionals, establishing and  sustaining an open-door policy with parents, establishing linkages with community based organizations and by  creating partnerships with local businesses. P.S. 811X is not simply a school - we are a community of lifelong learners!      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on our efforts over the 2017-2018 academic year, we will continue to work toward improvement in the Six  Elements of the Framework for Great Schools in the following areas through our annual goals.   1.  Looking at our 2017 -2018 IEP data, district and state feedback, we noticed that quality of the annual student   goals of IEPs are an area in need of improvement school-wide. By the end of the 2018-2019 school year we  will increase the quality of our annual goals on all IEPs by 15% as measured by checklists, rubrics, and SMART  guidelines.    2.  A second area in need of improvement during the 2018-2019 school year is improving our parent   participation and engagement in the school community. By the end of the 2018 -2019 school year 811x will  increase parent volunteers for school wide events by 20% from 30 different parents to 36 different parents in  order to increase results from 3.68 to 3.71 under Strong Family/Community Ties as measured by Learning  Environment Survey.    3.  By the end of the 2018-2019 school year, teachers will work collaboratively to develop differentiated hands  on activities in ELA in order to increase the percentage of students scoring Level 4 in ELA NYSAA from 34.1 %  to 40% .    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      4.  By the end of the 2018-2019 school year, all classroom teachers will work collaboratively to effectively create  and utilize informal assessments for students (Check lists, rubrics, data collection sheets, etc.) in Mathematics  while increasing the percentage of students scoring Level 4 in NYSAA (MATH) from 52.5% to 60 %. Also  increasing teachers’ ratings in 3d Using Assessment in Instruction by 5% as measured by Advance data.    5.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

The school received a rating of ‘well- developed’ on all components of its most recent Quality Review of 2016.   For the 2018 -2019 school year, our curriculum team developed a year- long curriculum map focusing on service  learning projects.In addition, our 12:1:4 and 6:1:1: classroom teachers will also use ReThink to support the yearly  curriculum map; making it more accessible for our students. The curriculum map is aligned to CCLS, NYSAA, Student  Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI) and embeds Career Development Occupational Standards (CDOS)  throughout. This decision supports teachers in differentiating instruction for students and suggestions for  Understanding by Design (UDL). The curriculum map is age appropriate and includes pre and post assessments for  diverse groups of students, check lists, leveled texts and multiple online resources to support teachers. To ensure  vertical and horizontal curriculum alignment/ coherence and to support learning/engagement, improve higher order  thinking skills and student readiness for post-secondary living the school’s curriculum teams create rigorous  performance tasks and rubrics in English Language Arts (ELA), Math, Social Studies, Science and Transition core  curriculum.   In determining our strengths and needs as they relate to the annual goals for PS 811X for the 2018-2019 school year  we have carefully considered our instructional programs, our achievement data from the 2017-2018 school year, how  the data has trended over a multiple year period, and academic resources in order to identify appropriate foci for  student growth. Through evaluation of our assessment results from the 2017-2018 school year, we have found that  our students are demonstrating strong and consistent scores across multiple years in both the local SANDI assessment  as well as the state NYSAA assessment. With assessment measures as a seemingly stable and strong suit of the school  annually, we have decided to shift our focus toward improvement of instruction techniques within the classroom.   Our Quality Review report from the 2015-2016 school year paints a picture of well-developed practices within our  school and that continued throughout the 2017-2018 school year. Concerning our improvement effort on assessment  methodologies, the quality reviewer noted “Across all classrooms, the school uses common assessments and rubrics  aligned to its curricula to analyze student work, make adjustments to curricula at the team and classroom levels, and  focus on extending the depth of real-time student data analysis.” These practices have been developed over years  and support our teaching community’s strong emphasis on reflective teaching practices through the use of data  driven decisions aligned to student individual needs.    Additionally, regarding pedagogy within the school, the reviewer noted that “Strategic curricular decisions build  coherence across grades and subject areas that are cognitively appropriate and challenging, engaging all students in  academics and life skills. All students have access to curricula and tasks that are relevant, foster and support student  independence, academic and behavioral growth, and college and career readiness skills.” This evidences 811x’s long  standing effort to clearly align common core learning standards with student needs, both academically and for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      transition in order to produce curriculum that is both purposeful and meaningful to all stakeholders. Furthermore, our  quality review report indicates that “All teachers participate in inquiry-based professional learning communities that  consistently examine data, student work, and instructional practice. Embedded leadership structures encourage  effective teacher leadership in making key decisions.”; demonstrating our focus on the development of teaching  professionals who continually improve their practice through collaboration, sharing of best practices, and reflection to  strengthen pedagogical decision making.    During the 2017-2018 school year Advance ratings for teachers reflected that Using Assessments in Instruction will be  an area of focus moving forward. Totals for the year show that 1% rated Ineffective, 14% Developing, 64% Effective  and 22% Highly Effective. Continuing our weekly professional development periods as well as data analysis will allow  for the teacher to develop common informal assessments to incorporate within daily instruction.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  We proactively address the needs of the students through highly integrated supports including School Wide Positive  Behavior Supports, Boys and Girls Club, Functional Behavior Assessments and Behavior Intervention Plans. All staff  members know and use a strategic and comprehensive system for referral and support for all students that includes  researched-based programs and practices intended to promote academic success, family engagement, and student  emotional health and wellness by implementing Get Ready to Learn (GRTL) and Social Emotional Literacy (SEL). The  data collected by classroom staff has identified areas of needs and strategies to promote students’ social emotional  health and is evident by the steady decrease in referrals made from the classroom.   The development of weekly PDP meetings by subject and student population has allowed for staff collaboration in  order to communicate the important roles of all stakeholders to ensure proper support for all students. The school  has implemented data tracking using SANDI, Social Emotional Standards (SEL) and Get ready to Learn (GRTL) in order  to monitor student needs and adjust as needed. Staff meets weekly in Instructional Teacher Teams to discuss and  track data across the classes and develop plans and goals for students both academically and socially.    The mission of P 811X’s behavior management system is to promote a safe learning environment for all of our  students. We believe that by making expectations clear, and directly teaching the behaviors that we want to see,  students will make better choices and thereby experience more positive outcomes in their daily routines. At P 811X, a  disruptive behavior is treated as a skill deficit and the necessary supports are provided to ensure student progress.    The development of pro-social behaviors and interpersonal relationship skills is an important part of the educational  process. Accordingly, our school has implemented a set of school-wide expectations for behavior. It is our expectation  that all of our students will demonstrate the ability to: Be Safe, Be Prepared, and Be Respectful throughout all of their  interactions and across every context.    Our three primary expectations are adapted and individualized across the various school environments (cafeteria,  classroom, etc.) to ensure that behavioral expectations are clear, teachable, observable, and acknowledgeable  throughout the school. Our school-wide expectations are used by the faculty as a framework for designing and  implementing instructional plans that emphasize the connection between choices and outcomes.   A key component of our school-wide behavior plan is our data collection system. The performance of each student is  tracked and documented on an individualized student performance log. In addition, students demonstrating a pattern  of self-defeating behaviors are tracked using the SWIS referral system. This system empowers our behavior team with  the ability to design data-driven interventions based on individual student needs. Behavioral support is then  differentiated and individualized to the specific needs and abilities of each student through further collaboration with  our Dean, Behavior Specialist, and school based counselors who further collect information regarding persistent  student behavior using an Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (ABC) chart. This measure is in place for students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19      whose behavior regresses or have one to one crisis paraprofessionals in order to design, implement, and monitor the  success of individual student needs when necessary.    Furthermore, on the whole school level we have developed a behavior matrix to clearly define what these  expectations mean. The matrix is designed to take each expectation and apply it to all settings our students work and  play: classroom(s), hallways, cafeteria, bathroom, etc. In order for PBIS to be effective, we hope to bring a consistent  level of effort towards these 3 B’s to all areas of the school, all of the time. In addition, over the past year we have  opened a sensory room to provide sensory 6:1:1 students a safe place to de-escalate from overstimulation and return  to work readiness.   Our school staff is trained in emotional literacy and its components are used throughout the school environment such  as school charter, classroom charters and mood meter daily check-ins. Furthermore, 95% of all paraprofessionals have  completed the basic re-think ABA training in order to identify instructional and de-escalation strategies for students.   With the implementation of these systems and structures, our Online Occurrence Reporting System (OORS) reports  have shown a significant decrease in incidents. Since the 2011 -2012 school year, there has been a 90% decrease in  overall incidents, with a 94% decrease in Level 4 incident reports alone.   Through these programs, all adults get to know students very well and personalize their learning for each. Students  demonstrate that they are aware of the positive behavior supports and expectations and earn privileges such as  participation in dances, parties, trips, basketball games, cooking and art classes as a result.   Counselors who have been trained in Social Emotional Learning collaborate with teachers to implement Social  Emotional Literacy strategies including the mood meter, class and school charters. To further support this we had  Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Training for 1:1 Crisis paraprofessionals. Students showed an increase in SANDI Social  Emotional Scores (SE) of 7.9% during the 2017-2018 school year. The implementation of Social Emotional Literacy  across ELA and Math has aided the increases in student data. Students in the most restrictive environments of 12:1:4  and 6:1:1 programs, specifically, 6:1:1 students showed a 7.64% increase(up .06% from last year) in SANDI Social  Emotional scores while the 12:1:4 students had an increase of 7.12% (up .05% from last year) in Social Emotional  scores.    Despite our consistent gains over the past few years with respects to decreases in OORS incidents and student growth  in Social Emotional development as per our SANDI results, we’ve noticed a rise in Level 3 incidents that we addressed  for the 2017-2018 school year. In particular, our B24, Level 3 incidents have increased substantially during the 2016- 2017 school year from 13 out of 24 total incidents in the 2015-2016 school year to 34 out of our 50 total incidents, or  68% through June of the 2016-2017 school year followed by a decrease of overall incidents (46) and decrease of level  3 incidents (33) but an increase of 71% of the incidents being level 3. These increases demonstrate a near tripling of  B24 infractions over the same time span and warrant a substantial focus. As a result of the increase in percentage of  B24 Level 3 infractions on the school level, we have additionally seen an increase in staff Workers’ Comp claims.  Further information from the OORS system indicates that all other infraction types have remained similar with no  more than 1 incident of each infraction type reported throughout the 17-18 school year.    In addressing these issues we will seek to improve upon our systems as well as build staff capacity in order to mitigate  the growth of Level B24, 3 infractions school wide. In doing so, we will look to leverage our successes with the sensory  room by rolling out a mindfulness space for students to engage in thoughtful reflective practices. Furthermore, we  will identify individual students whose behaviors are consistent with level 3 infractions to work with our behavior  specialists and counseling staff on developing actionable plans based off of their ABC charts to address the needs of  such students throughout the day. In building staff capacity, we will also work towards increasing capacity of our  paraprofessionals using the RETHINK system to complete the advanced portions of the training in addition to  supplemental in-house trainings focusing on identifying and managing student behaviors through TCI and LSCI  techniques.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20      In order to address the increasing Level 3 infractions during the 2018-2019 school year, 811X has ensured to train 36  staff members in TCI, which includes several members of the BRT. Paraprofessionals were also trained in best  practices in crisis intervention by our behavior management team. The training focused on the typical baseline  behaviors of students reflective of our school population and the interventions that would be most effective in  addressing those behaviors. Our goal is to increase the trainings to focus in on specific needs of our paraprofessional  population, thus increasing efficiency of the paras while dealing with student behavior and, as a result, decreasing the  number of staff injuries. Included in the paraprofessional training will be the selection of "lead" paraprofessionals as  part of a "Paraprofessional Committee" in order to provide PD, support and mentorship to both new and returning  staff.    As compared to the 2016-2017 school year, the number of B24 incidents has decreased by 1 and other infractions saw  a decrease of 4 in total. We will continue to focus in on decreasing B24 incidents by implementing more PBIS activities  and rewards days for students and continuing our professional development efforts for our staff. Additionally, the  number of overall incidents has decreased 10% from 51 in 2016-2017, to 46 in 2017-2018.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In order to improve the quality and compliance of all Individualized Educational Plans there will be a distinct focus on  developing academic-challenging and appropriate annual goals for all students. To increase the percentage of  students moving along the Less Intensive Service Continuum pedagogues will use SANDI and Rethink as assessment  tools to measure students’ academic abilities in reading, writing, communication, social emotional, and math skills.  Pedagogues will then use the results to develop specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time- bound  (SMART) goals and appropriate PLOPs.    In 2017 -2018, 811x increased its compliance rate in the domain of transition planning from 94% to 98%. In addition  there was a reduction in services of 37%, thus moving students to a least restrictive environment.    School leadership along with the School Implementation Team (SIT) will implement a structure that includes ongoing  trainings and support in writing quality annual goals. In addition, we will continue providing support through review  teams and feedback to each individualized goal. Vocational assessments and data will be collected in order to help  guide families and staff through the entire IEP process. The assistance of outside agencies will continue to provide  families with the necessary support to move forward in the creation of IEPs.   Our IEP Present Levels of Performance as well and Annual Goals will continue to be assessed using For All Rubrics, to  meet district/state standards. School leaders, stakeholders, and pedagogues understand that assessment data is an  effective approach to drive instruction, create Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goals, and monitor student learning.  Following each unit of study, assessments are administered to capture student progress for targeted skills. Student  binders are used to maintain varied data such as vocational assessments, IEP goals, monthly unit assessments, and  student work samples.” We have worked diligently to increase the quality of IEP's using rubrics, checklist, inquiry  teams, the development of an IEP review team and professional development for staff and families.   Caregivers and students will continue to participate in the writing process of the IEP. In addition, agencies working  with students will participate and collaborate in students’ assessments to paint a clear picture of students’ level of  performance.    Moving forward, looking at our 2018 -2019 IEP data, district feedback, teacher surveys, and IEP review team feedback,  we see that quality of the annual goals section of IEPs are an area in need of improvement school-wide. Areas directly  relating to the criteria and method sections of goals were a specific area of need. Through improvement in this field,  we will improve the quality of student learning experiences, and better prepare them for post-secondary placement.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to 2017-18 Learning Environment Survey results, 93% of parents responded positively that the principal  works to promote family and community involvement in the school. All questions to parents regarding school  practices under the "Strong Family and Community Ties" section received positive feedback at a rate of 90% or more.   We believe that providing parents/guardians/families the opportunity to engage and interact within the school  community will provide them with not only valuable information but built enough trust to honestly complete the  Learning Environment Survey.   According to the 2017 -2018 Learning Environment Survey, 94% of parents who responded to the survey feel that  school staff regularly communicates with them about how families can help the child learn. Home/school  communication has improved, parent completion rates for the Learning Environment Survey increased for the 2017 -  2018 by 1.0%.    Parent involvement is crucial for student academic, social emotional and post – secondary success and we offer an  array of activities throughout the course of the year to improve it. At the start of the school year introductory letters  are sent to families, as well as a “Meet the Principal Day” where parents are introduced to every aspect of the school  community. They also have the opportunity to meet the teams involved with their child/children from teachers to  related service providers. In addition, they are informed of the school’s goals and curriculum.   Student progress/data is shared with parents during monthly curriculum workshops, Parent/Teacher Conferences as  well as PDs with the parent coordinator and transition department. The teachers share student portfolios, SANDI  results, IEP goals, formal and informal assessments and student work. Furthermore, student data has been  streamlined from assessments such as SANDI, curriculum assessments, school report cards and IEP updates. School  staff also reaches families through phone calls and our automated system; School messenger.   In order to increase parent involvement, we have added a School Family worker to assist with parent engagement as  well as the addition of a Bilingual Transition Coordinator to assist families with post-secondary outcomes. The Parent  coordinator has also started monthly curriculum PDs for parents so that they can support students at home with  homework. Furthermore, the parent coordinator has begun to survey parents regarding their direct needs as they  relate to wide array of topics from transition planning and agency support to strategies. Based on this survey  (conducted in September), the parent coordinator then works with relevant staff and outside agencies to design and  facilitate parent trainings based on expressed need.

Beginning in September, we plan to survey student families in order to  gauge what their interests and needs are in supporting student development and meeting student long-term  transition needs. Based on school-wide survey results, we will plan a professional development / workshop calendar  tailored to their expressed interests.   We will additionally leverage community resources and state / local agencies in order to provide parents with high  quality workshops that move toward establishing their needs. Such agencies include OPWDD to conduct our front  door trainings and Medicaid service agencies to enroll families in students for supplemental services. Additional  community resources that will be leveraged for parent and guardian workshops include lawyer representing parents  in custodial rights cases for guardianship claims. Additionally informational sessions including the new STHP Outreach  program and how it benefits/supports families in NYC Shelters and how all families can support.   We will further ensure that families and guardians are informed of workshops and trainings by leveraging the  language access coordinator to ensure that all workshop and survey documents are in parent preferred languages as  well as to provide interpretation services at the workshops and trainings themselves. Moreover, we will leverage  cluster teachers (i.e. gym, music, art, horticulture, culinary arts, etc.) to assist in engaging parents and students in  purposeful bonding activities, trainings, and celebrations.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local         31,310     3, 311                                        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 75X811, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The school's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school's Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.         Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. X811 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49           providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child's progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school's Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school's  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school's Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school's Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Our target  population for the Title III after school program will be selected using the following criteria:  * Performance at the Entering and Emerging Levels in the reading and writing modalities of the  NYSESLAT (12:1:1, 6:1:1) *Performance at the "Not Engaged" and "Engaged" in the SANDI  assessments (12:1:4).Instruction for the Title III after school program will be delivered in  English.  Four  teachers will be running the Title III program with the support of an additional  teacher once a week to facilitate physical activity under the program.  All five teachers will be  licensed ENL or Bilingual providers.  Support staff will include 6 paraprofessionals who are  bilingual in Spanish.  An  administrator will oversee the program, whose official hours are from  7:30 am to 3:30 pm.  The program will run from the Last week in January 2019 through mid  March 2019 for a total of 17 sessions. Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:00-5:15 pm.  The  purpose of the P811X Title III supplemental program is to create an after-school ELL program  that will not only advance our students’ English Language Proficiency, but will provide them  with an ADL-based curriculum to enrich their understandings of self-care and community  involvement.  Students will be  given the tools to make informed choices and decisions regarding  their overall health in order to lead more independent and active lives. This theme has been  aligned with the current school curriculum which is based on “Connecting for the future school,  Home, Community and Adult Life” in order to create continuity between the instructional day  and our after school program.  Our Title III program will utilize a combination of physical fitness through the use of Power  Brain Education, and ADL activities based on the Attainment Core Curriculum. In using a multi- disciplinary and multi-sensory approach to our health and wellness program, we will offer  students the opportunity to develop their physical and academic understandings necessary to  address their needs as they pertain to success within the community. Additionally, students will  learn about media literacy and how we use it to make decisions. The National Association for  Media Literacy Education  defines media literacy as “the  ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication.” In doing  so, we will engage our students in an intensive academic, media awareness, and physical  program to promote overall wellness through instruction in nutrition, hygiene, controlled fine  and gross motor movement, and promotion of Common Core Learning Standards and New  Language Arts Progressions competencies.     This Title III Health and Wellness after school program will integrate learning standards from  multiple content areas, using physical fitness and a Balanced Literacy approach. “Many studies  support a balanced literacy program as appropriate for students whose first language is not  English.  A balanced literacy program provides opportunities for both explicit instruction and  student-directed activities.” (Goldberg & Gallimore, 1991).  We believe that through content  area instruction, media awareness  and participation in physical activity and nutrition-conscious  meal preparation training, we will provide student-centered directed activities and explicit  instruction in wellness. This program will provide “meaningful instructional contexts” (North  Central Regional Educational Laboratory) to help students learn and which will enrich their lives   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   and language development.We believe that through content area instruction, media  awareness  and participation in physical activity and nutrition-conscious meal  preparation training, we will provide student-centered directed activities and explicit instruction  in wellness.

There will be three PD sessions: one on the Monday prior  to the commencement of the program from 3:00 p.m- 5:15 pm, one mid way through the  program on Monday March 20th, and a third prior to the program's completion to take place on  Wednesday April 17th. Research shows that trained and informed staff is the most important  school related factor influencing student achievement.  All teachers of the Title III staff will  facilitate each PD session. Pedagogues and paraprofessionals will be invited to participate in the  Title III professional development series so that they can further incorporate ELL based  strategies into their instruction and benefit from implementing program theory and themes and  goals into student learning and community experiences. In his article "Professional Development  and Teacher Change" (Guskey, 2002), Thomas Guskey emphasizes the importance of ongoing  professional development in their daily practice, noting that teachers are hoping to gain "through  professional development are specific, concrete, and practical ideas that directly relate to the  day-to-day operation of their classrooms (Fullan & Miles, 1992).

All communication will take place in  English and in the family's native language. Parents of participating ELLs will be invited to an  orientation session on January 15th, regarding the Title III Health and Wellness Program (all  disseminated information will be translated into parents' preferred languages).Parents will be  invited to six workshop sessions to participate in the information, materials, and practices that  will be utilized during the Title III program. The workshop sessions will center on the  application of the Power Brain movement program and the technology involved to develop and  reinforce language skills through student physical development, the development of nutritional  wellness and vocabulary for students to monitor their habits in order to make informed choices,  and the development of wellness strategies and goals to increase the success of students within  their home and community experiences.  Three of these sessions will take place during the school instructional day at no additional cost to  the program, and three will be held during the after school program.  The workshops will be led  by the ENL Coordinator,  Wellness Educator, and Parent Coordinator , Title III after school  program supports staff (paraprofessionals), and ELL Administrator at no cost to the TITLE III  program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy and literacy based academic skills of our ELLs are assessed through the Student Annual Needs Determination  Inventories (SANDI) and teacher-made assessments.  The SANDI assessment is a comprehensive tool which measures literacy  skills from pre-primer through grade 9.  Student performance on this assessment helps inform program placement and  instructional decisions related to each student's IEP. Additionally, Based on SANDI results, we are able to identify and target  specific CCLS aligned benchmark skills and goals as they relate to language needs for receptive, expressive and written  communication in addition to content area instructional needs, transition skills, and social-emotional progressions for each  individual student. Teacher made assessments provide further insight into individual student needs as they relate to language  acquisition needs as they pertain to the school curriculum and engaging within the curriculum materials which are directly  aligned to SANDI results pertaining to specific CCLS aligned benchmark skills.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      To support the assessment of student skills and inform instructional planning for our ELLs, school instructional leadership  reviews the Spring and Fall SANDI results as well as curricular achievement of ELL students in addition to looking at school  based curricular needs. Teacher made assessments are aligned to the needs of various learner populations through curriculum  development of leveled teaching points and assessments. Annual student placement protocols are also utilized by school staff  to place students into classrooms in accordance to SANDI achievements levels to ensure coherence in instructional needs and  programs for each student.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments are also an important component of our ELL program. All of our ELLs participate in assessments  through out the school year to gain the insight we would from the use of standardized curriculum and tests.  This includes but  is not limited to: School-Created checklist assessment which outlines indicators of proficiency across all four domains of  language, Student Annual Needs Determination Inventories (SANDI), periodic assessments created on the school level using  SANDI and CCLS tasks from NYSAA as a guideline, six reporting periods when teachers analyze data to make conclusions on  progress and ascertain if current goals have been met or need modification, portfolios and teacher created materials  additionally are used to monitor student progression across the program. AYP is determined through student scores on the  NYSAA examination that outlines student progression within the core content areas in all testing modalities when students are  assessed at their given age. NYSESLAT progression is considered when applicable to students who are able to receive a  reportable score in all modalities and their progress is measured using decision level and raw score data. Students are  primarily assessed for progression in the language arts from the SANDI raw score data in conjunction with progression toward  meeting individual IEP goals. Student progress is then considered for ELL groups, sub-groups, and individuals.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In order to address interventions based on the data from our measurement systems, the school leadership team reviews and  identifies programs and processes that had a positive impact on student learning and identify improvement systems when  forecasting needs and interventions in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) for the upcoming year. Summative data from  SANDI and the school curriculum is also utilized by classroom teachers to complete the student placement protocol to align  student academic levels       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Currently, our school serves ELLs in grades 6-12.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As we are a predominantly alternate assessment school the NYSESLAT examination is used sparingly as a measure of student  achievement on the school level since the majority of our students who sit for the exam are unable to receive a score because  they could not complete all four modalities. Students who receive scores above the Entering level of the NYSESLAT  examination are considered when assigning students to programs in consideration with other measures of achievement and  needs. Most students are counted as beginners for overall proficiency and modality analysis. Many of these students are  unable to read or write in conventional manners due to their cognitive disabilities. Some of them are limited in areas of verbal  and listening skills as well.  Therefore, we are unable to ascertain any information on gains towards proficiency for these  students.  Because of this, we utilize a combination of the SANDI, NYSAA, and teacher made assessments, rubrics and  checklists in order to accurately gauge student levels in all modalities in addition to various content and social emotional  achievement benchmarks.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The school leadership team reviews the data from NYSESLAT and class and individual student progress in the SANDI  assessment to make determinations as to student levels for instructional grouping. School leadership additionally references  behavior data from SWIS and OORS to make determinations as to appropriate settings for students such as work readiness and  prevocational programs. Teachers additionally evaluate individual student performance using SANDI, teacher made   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         assessments, and behavior data to make recommendations for program placement as well as identify program changes at the  beginning, mid, and end of year benchmarks.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    Instruction is delivered through the organizational models of 4 ENL teachers who do both integrated as well as and  stand alone models of ENL instruction. Our school is a self-contained special education program where all of our  students participate in Alternate Assessment and are considered ungraded.  Therefore classes are comprised of  students from “grade levels” 9-12.  This is why our ELL Program Breakdown chart seems to have information that is  different then what we are stating in our narrative since technically all teachers serve all grades.   Our ENL teachers  select a caseload of students based on student class rosters. The ENL teachers then create a schedule for integrating  language development and stand alone services for their caseloads by evenly distributing the experience of stand  alone and integration across their caseload. Each ENL teacher is additionally assigned to deliver ENL instruction to one  of the three Bilingual self contained classes through integration and stand alone services. The remaining bilingual  students who are in alternate placements and students who are mandated for ESL services only are also placed in  classes according to their classifications, mandated ratios, and level of functioning (both academic and social).  We  have classes where the ELL students are both heterogeneously and homogeneously grouped in reference to their  English language proficiency level. The ENL teachers instruct, utilizing ESL methodologies in both the stand alone and  integration services and will support language development for ELLs who are not on their caseloads when in  integrated classes.  Newcomer and Entering level ELLs are additionally prioritized within ENL provider caseloads n  order to ensure equity for students who require more urgent remediation and services since our students are  alternate assessment and in many cases cannot demonstrate progression under the NYSESLAT examination system.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      Instruction is delivered through the organizational models of 3 Spanish Transitional Bilingual Education programs all  three of which serve grades 9-12. As mentioned earlier our school is a self-contained special education program  where all of our students participate in Alternate Assessment and are considered ungraded.  Therefore classes are  comprised of students from “grade levels” 9-12. The home language is delivered through the core content areas by  the bilingual certified teacher to which Home Language Arts instruction is delivered in conjunction with mathematics  and social studies. The TBE program is additionally supported by an ENL teacher assigned to each class to devliver the  ENL mandated minutes as per CR Part 154. In the TBE program, students are grouped along levels of cognition and  student IEP mandated ratios in order to group students as homogeneously as possible to aid instruction. Students are  additionally assigned to TBE classes based on three contiguous grade levels. All Bilingual mandated ELLs that do not  have a placement within a TBE class are assigned an Alternate Placement Paraprofessional in order to assure language  development and coherence in both their new and home languages as well as support communication efforts  regarding instruction between the school and home environments..    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      ALL 3 Spanish TBE programs have students who are all Entering as per their NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and or LAB-R scores. We  therefore give the maximum percentage of Native Language Support as outlined in the TBE chart.  Students in our TBE  program receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of HLA as mandated by CR Part 154 for  beginner ELLs. Additionally students within the TBE program and ENL only instruction students have a split between integrated  and stand alone minutes as per CR Part 154. HLA instruction follows the tenets of Balanced Literacy and is parallel to the  instruction imparted in monolingual classes and are delivered in the core content areas throughout the day for 2 periods a day  in the Mathematics and Social Studies or Science. The certified Bilingual teacher provides all mandated minutes outlined above  for the Home Language Arts. Bilingual teachers also teach all content areas: ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science. Our ENL  program as stated earlier is run by 4 ENL teachers.  ENL teachers select classes to work with, therefore maximizing group size  and increasing the number of mandated minutes each student receives as per CR Part 154; which additionally helps us to  ensure that all ELL students are served via the integration model.  ENL minutes are delivered using the integrated and stand  alone model to their instructional groupings so that students are on similar cognitive and academic levels in their groupings.  Students are given native language support as needed in our ESL program from either our ENL teachers who are Spanish  bilingual or Paraprofessionals who are bilingual in student’s native language.  ELA minutes are provided by ESL students’  classroom teacher incorporating ESL methodologies under the guidance of the ENL providers. ENL teachers      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    In our TBE program model, content area instruction is given by the certified self-contained bilingual teacher. Teachers in our  TBE program use elements of the SIOP model for planning and delivering instruction.  When considering the SIOP model  teachers first consider the approach which best fits the content being taught and the students’ cognitive abilities. The  approaches most commonly used in our TBE program are Whole Language Experience, Total Physical Response and  Cooperative Learning.  As per the SIOP model language objectives are outlined in conjunction with content objectives to  ensure that language instruction is always at the forefront.  Objectives are chosen based on students’ needs, Bilingual  Progressions and The New York State Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers also build background knowledge by linking  objectives to students’ everyday life and information they have already been taught or exposed.  Our instructional approach  also outlines that teachers introduce new concepts and vocabulary words.   In our TBE program a minimum of two content  areas are taught in students’ native language per day through direct instruction within the home language in mathematics,  science, or social studies. Our ENL program is similar to our TBE program in that ENL teachers use the same approaches for  delivering instruction as outlined in our TBE program. (i.e. the use of the SIOP model, ENL strategies such as Whole Language  Approach and Cooperative learning, the use of the Standards and building background knowledge) Content area instruction in  our ENL program is determined and delivered with collaboration between the ENL teacher and the self-contained classroom  teacher who is responsible for the majority of these students’ instruction.  Classroom teachers choose content goals based on  students current needs and the school-wide curriculum map which is updated as needed.  The classroom teacher then  collaborates with the ENL teacher to create a Student Instructional Priority Plan which covers all content areas.  The ENL  teacher provided the classroom teacher with insight on incorporating language objectives into the plan and approaches he or  she can use to help the gain the content area knowledge while moving along the English Language Proficiency continuum.  The  ENL provider will either integrate their teaching to support with lessons the classroom teacher is engaging in or conduct stand  alone, delivering instruction based on the student plan mentioned above and any additional language needs. Both the ENL  provider and the classroom teacher collect data on progress towards these goals.  ENL teachers then meet with classroom  teachers approximately every six week to discuss progress made on Students Instructional Priority Plan.  These common  meeting times happen during the classrooms teachers prep or PDP.  ENL teachers are given the flexibility to adjust their prep  for the day to accommodate the need for these meetings.  Classroom teachers are also given access to books in students’  native language. Students in Alternate Placement receive additional support from a paraprofessional who speaks the students’  native language. The schedule created for teachers allows for students to be fully served. ENL teachers push-in during  intructional meal times as well as during instructional time. Multi-sensory and multicultural materials are infused throughout  all aspects of instruction in both our TBE and ENL programs. Both programs also use visual scaffolding, regalia, interactive  read-aloud and graphic organizers during instruction as we find these meet their needs both as ELLs and special education  student. Instructional emphasis for both programs is based on:            •               School-wide curriculum created by 811X  teachers and coaches           •               Career skills and Work-study programming          •                Instruction in the Activities of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      Daily Living          •               Functional Academics Curricula:  ELA, Math, Science & Technology, Social Studies, Occupational  Studies, Vocational Studies,  Career Development, Physical Education and the Arts          •               ENL Standards, New York  State Common Core Standards and Applied Learning Standards  In addition we provided support to our more than 70 ELLs who  have been X-coded and are served as per their IEP.  They participate in rich functional academics programs which afford them  ample opportunity to maintain and build upon the English language proficiency they have already achieved.  Some of these  programs include full and part-time work classes, and cooking programs.  These students are also provided support in  preparation for the NYSESLAT exam as well as direct instruction during integrated model services.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are assessed in their home language annually through individual teacher adaptation to the curriculum. Students within  TBE classes and students with alternate placement paraprofessionals receive additional supports to translate their formative  assessments into the home language of the student. Additionally, student goals are determined annually by the SANDI  assessment to which student benchmark achievement goals are determined for all modalities. These goals in turn are  translated toward curriculum experiences that include assessment in all four modalities. The classroom teacher then monitors  student progression within the curriculum in accordance to English acquisition and home language achievement.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE and newcomer students often are assigned priority caseloads within our ENL and Bilingual programs. In this manner we  try to ensure their development of their new language skills quickly while reinforcing instruction within their home language.  Additionally, newcomer and SIFE students are immediately assessed for their levels of skill attainment in all four modalities  and in other academic and social fields utilizing the SANDI system in order to appropriately place them homogeneously within  classes amongst their peers. Newcomer and SIFE ELLs additionally often are assigned an alternate placement paraprofessional  to promote language acquisition and transfer of knowledge from the home language into their new language. Students  additionally work toward individual benchmark goals for language development which are tracked and monitored by their ENL  and Bilingual providers. Students curriculum is adapted to meet the individual student needs based on learning style, level of  achievement, and assistive technology and other IEP based accommodations as necessary. Developing ELLs are provided all of  the same considerations as Newcomer and SIFE students and are additionally placed within priority caseloads as well as  provided the same adaptations.Our school provides services for long term ELLs for as long as they need it and according to  their IEPs. The majority of our Long Term ELLs have made great gains in their English Language Proficiency but are unable to  demonstrate this on NYSESLAT due to the nature of their disabilities. Our school also provides after school programs (Title III  and Project Champs) to help foster gains in their English Language Proficiency.  This year select groups of our Long Term ELLs  have also been enrolled in our AIS program and as the focus of a student based data inquiry team. Due to the cognitive and  physical delays of our students, many ELLs do not achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT examination. If students were to test  out of NYSESLAT, they would continue to be supported by ENL and BIL teachers for up to two years by providing their  mandated minutes. In addition, former ELLs would continue to be exposed to individual language development target goals  through baseline assessment and IEP goal creation as well as continue to receive their IEP mandated accommodations and  services to develop skills in the English language and adapt curriculum as necessary.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ELL students within our program are students with disabilities. ELLs receive the same individualized and focused instruction  as the rest of our students as mentioned above with respects to IEP accommodations, instructional programming, annual skills  evaluation, and curricular adaptations. Instruction is focused on development and support of access/foundation skills such as  functional communication approaches for ELLs with severe communication disabilities including Mayer Johnson, real images,  and Carol Goosens symbols, and emergent literacy strategies such as The Workshop Model, centers and word walls.  Opportunities for skill acquisition included Balanced Literacy approaches, creation of bilingual communication boards and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      bilingual story boards, augmentative and alternative communication systems in the native language and in English, total  communication approaches (transition boards, photographs, paraprofessional who speaks native language and English) and  New York State Common Core Standards via adaptive curriculum.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As our school is entirely comprised of students with special education mandates all ELL students naturally receive  accommodations for program needs for their disability diagnosis, mandated class size ratio as well as related services such as  speech, counseling, physical therapy and occupational therapy.  These ELLs students are placed with teachers who are highly  qualified to meet their special needs. The formative assessments align with the ELA and Math curriculum of the school and  informal assessments are the teachers checking for understanding. The environment is determined by the CSE at initial intake.  Student goals in all ELA modalities are created for each student on an annual basis in conjunction with student ENL providers  based off of individual student needs derived from SANDI baseline assessments. Student progression is monitored between  the classroom and ENL teacher respectively to determine goal achievement. Instructional flexibility is determined by the  teacher and ENL provider to make appropriate adaptations to each student's learning experience so that they may achieve  their individual goals which are embedded within our curriculum. Students who demonstrate academic and social growth are  re evaluated for lesser restrictive environments based on teacher and school psychologist recommendation and evaluation.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students placement in District 75 is an intervention in it self.  District 75 offers ELLs who are in special education small student  to staff ratio and teachers who are highly qualified in differentiating and scaffolding objectives and curriculum to make it  accessible to all types of learners.  They also receive supplemental interventions as needed, such as PT, OT, Speech and  counseling.  These services further allow them to achieve academic and language goals.  Additionally ELLs participate in several  of the academic interventions used in our school.  We currently use SMILE and AIS which teaches the basic elements for  reading and writing to non-readers with special needs.  This program is especially useful for newcomers since students need  not have any phonemic awareness to participate.  Picture cues are used through out the program which is a strategy which  aligns perfectly with our practice for ELLs.  This year we will also begin using Rosetta Stone language development software for  our newcomers to help build proficiency in their speaking and listening skills.  EQUALS is a math intervention we use which is  aligned with needs of ELL and students in special education as it is hands-on program with concepts taught being taught in a  concrete manner with the use of manipulatives. We additionally utilize an adaptive curriculum (ATTAINMENT) that is directly  linked to our SANDI measurement of student achievement in all core content areas. All curriculum is adapted to suit the  learning style and language development needs of all students, and is additionally further adapted to student home language  as applicable by Bilingual staff and alternate placement paraprofessionals in their home language.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We continually strive to improve our program for ELLs. This year we will be seeking a highly qualified teacher to open a 6:1:1  Spanish Bilingual program. Furthermore,  we will be incorporating ENL providers into our curriculum design teams for all  content areas so that ENL methodologies are built into the learning experience of all ELLs through regular classroom  instruction.This year ENL teachers will begin using a collaboratively developed data collection skills assessment which will  capture gains in English Language proficiency across all four domains based on the SANDI and NYSESLAT achievement for our  ELLS.  This assessment looks at skills which not only align with the degrees of proficiency but with students cognitive abilities as  well.  Therefore we will be able to analyze progress for all ELL students even those with severe physical and cognitive delays  through curriculum and SANDI aligned rubrics, checklists, and data collection sheets in order to better target individual student  needs as they relate to English language progression.  We have also formed a professional learning community comprised of all  our ELL staff to monitor progress of our ELLs, share knowledge, and discuss need as they arise.  This community will also be  providing professional development and support for all teachers in our school so they can better serve our ELL population  through regularly scheduled PDP and collaborative inquiry groups.  Additionally, literacy support staff will be involved in  preparing students for the NYSESLAT examination through targeting interventions to support learners in each of the four  assessed modalities..      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All ELLs in our school have access to all our supplemental programs and services.  ELLs can choose from several clubs to  participate in during school hours.  Clubs include study in dance, art, music, technology and physical fitness.  These programs  allow ELL students to practice their social and communication skills with peers whose native language is English. Furthermore  ELLs are also encouraged to participate in our after school Title III program.  This year the program will focus on English  language instruction through health and wellness curriculum and experiences.   Many of our ELLs participate in Project Champs  which is an after school physical fitness program as well. We will not discontinue any existing programs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Native language support is naturally built into our Spanish TBE programs.  NLA is taught in Spanish and is provided for a  minimum of 180 minutes of instruction per week. HLA follows the guidelines of the Balanced Literacy program. The HLA  instruction is provided by a bilingual teacher who adapts materials to meet the needs of cognitively delayed students who are  following the alternate curriculum. Students receive adaptive technology as per their IEP mandates. In addition, each Bilingual  class is equipped with a smart board interactive system as well as an Ipad to assist students with access to the curriculum. Each  classroom is additionally equipped with a Promethean Board to develop interactive instruction with the use of purchased  supplemental leveled texts that include illustration. The curriculum is adapted from the general education curriculum and  common core learning standards from the ATTAINMENT company which in turn directly link to student SANDI assessments  and IEP goals for development. All ELLs have access to classroom technology, curricular adaptations and IEP mandated  accommodations as necessary to access and develop in the core content areas.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The students literacy skills in their Native Language varies based on abilities and cognitive delays and the teachers use  differentiated instruction to met their individual needs. Home Language support needs for our TBE classrooms is assessed  through student achievement information based off of teacher observation and data collection in regards to our curriculum as  well as NYSESLAT achievement levels of each student and necessary IEP driven supports. Home language support needs in our  ENL program is assessed through teacher observation and data collection as it relates to curriculum and student needs  pertaining to the four language modalities assessed under the NYSESLAT examination. Home language supports for TBE and  ENL programs are provided through adapted materials including books, student created projects, Mayer Johnson Symbols,  workbooks, augmentative devices and communication boards.   Similarly native language support is provided as needed during  instruction of all content areas through translation and interpretation of materials by staff speakers of the native language for  our students. Teachers also have access to materials to help build native language libraries in the classrooms for student who  are not in our TBE program but are assessed through observation as needing additional native language supports. Native  language support is naturally built into our Spanish TBE programs.  NLA is taught in Spanish and is provided for a minimum of  180 minutes of instruction per week. HLA follows the guidelines of the Balanced Literacy program. The HLA instruction is  provided by a bilingual teacher who adapts materials to meet the needs of cognitively delayed students who are following the  alternate curriculum. Students receive adaptive technology as per their IEP mandates. In addition, each Bilingual class is  equipped with a smart board interactive system as well as an Ipad to assist students with access to the curriculum. The  curriculum is adapted from the general education curriculum and common core learning standards from the ATTAINMENT  company which in turn directly link to student SANDI assessments and IEP goals for development. All ELLs have access to  classroom technology, curricular adaptations and IEP mandated accommodations as necessary to access and develop in the  core content areas.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instructional materials used to educate ELLs in our school are age appropriate as they are often modified by our teachers to  meet the cognitive needs of our students.  These materials included but are not limited to school-created curriculum, adapted  books, picture books, communication boards, and picture dictionaries, audio and video programs for learning English and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      functional based curriculum which prepare our ELLs who will soon be transitioning out of school.   Technology plays an  important role in the instruction of ELLs.  All teachers of ELLs have access to two media rooms where teachers can conduct  lessons with student each using their own desktop computer.  We also have several laptop carts which teachers can also use to  conduct computer based lessons in their classroom.  Additionally each Spanish TBE class has a smart board in it.  This allows  the teacher to incorporate hands-on, visual learning in to the students’ everyday experiences.  All students have access to  augmentative communication devices if needed which can be programmed to speak in both English and the students’ native  language. All ELLs service are tracked and monitored by the District 75 office of English Language Learners through the Google  DOCS system as far as schedules, caseloads, minutes served, and additional student information. In house, ENL and Bilingual  teachers work together to optimize student service needs based on scheduling and student grouping considerations. ELLs and  teachers of ELLs additionally have access to all items purchased using TITLE III funding such as Ipads, computers (laptops and  desktops, and instructional software to support their needs throughout the instructional day. Furthermore, ENL providers work  along-side curriculum teams and classroom teachers to adapt our core and transition based curriculum (ATTAINMENT) in order  to develop school curriculum that incorporates ENL strategies and home language supports into the daily learning experience  for our ELLs by adapting readings, assessments, lessons, and teaching points to meet student needs.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our main site is a self contained building. We do have 2 off sites at the Bronx HS for the Visual Arts (4 self contained 8:1:1  classes and 4 SETS classes ) and Lehman College (1 self contained 12:1:1 working program class and 19:1:2 SETSS class). To  support our ELLs within these programs, one of our ENL providers will travel to the BHSVA site one day per week to deliver  instruction to students who require language development supports in which the curriculum for our 8:1:1 classes mirrors that  of the main site. For our 9:1:2 SETSS program, students will receive pull-out instruction to support language transfer needs  based off of the general education curriculum that is followed through the program. Our 12:1:1 working class at Lehman  College receives language services from our ENL providers at the main school site every Friday and during morning hours for  students who transition to the site from school on a Monday through Thursday basis. These students additionally follow the  school adaptive curriculum mentioned earlier and receive the same supports and technological access as categorized in  prompt 14.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    ELLs in our program which is focused on transitioning students into their adult life have the resources and support services  they need to do so.  We have an excellent transition team which works with students and parents to help facilitate plans for  the future.  Our role included connecting them with community resources and agencies for adults with disabilities in addition  to helping them find appropriate program and/or job placements. These activities are coordinated by our parent coordinator  Miriam Luciano in conjunction with our Bilingual Transition team consisting of Jaime Sanchez and Sonia Williams. These  services are immediately offered to all incumbent students to align additional outside agency supports for students to develop  academic and social skills. Newcomer ELLs additionally are immediately assessed via Level 1 vocational surveys (both by  parents and students) as well as SANDI in order to develop an accurate picture of student wants, needs and ability levels.  These institutions help identify student levels of achievement and align their wants and needs for their transition out of our  program into their instructional experience. Newcomer ELLs additionally have priority seating within ENL and Bilingual classes  to assist in development of their language skills in English and transfer existing skills from their home language. Newcomer  ELLs are additionally supported by ELL department technology including Ipads, computers, and instructional software to  accelerate their acquisition of English language skills. All school support staff additionally evaluate newcomer ELLs to generate  a baseline of student skills and develop student needs (i.e. counseling services are offered to students and parents, Speech  baselines are conducted, PT and OT levels of achievement are identified). Our Speech and Language department additionally  evaluates the communication needs of all newcomer ELLs in order to identify methodologies and technology to support  student language acquisition needs; i.e. dynavox communication systems, ipads, etc. which are then added to student IEP  mandates as necessary.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?      Currently our school does not offer language electives to ELL's      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently, our school only features ENL and TBE programs     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development Program for all staff responsible for delivery and instruction and services to limited English  proficient students-The ELL Compliance person, a member of the LAP Policy team has been designated to attend District 75  professional development on Compliance issues including, program mandates, instructional accountability, and the  administration of NYSESLAT.  The ELL Compliance person then provides professional development bases on the information  obtained to all teachers of ELL students.  The PDs for the ELL teachers help align tasks and curriculum to the Common Core  standards in order to comply with the Common Core Standards and instruction of ELLs. Additionally ESL and Bilingual Teachers  also attend District 75 ELL training.          These outside sources of professional development help our teachers of ELLs to  develop sound practices as they relate to common core instruction for ELL students with disabilities. These trainings include:  Planning Thematic Units for ELLs with Disabilities, Home Language Arts Instructional PD Series: Designing Effective Classroom  Assessments using the Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) for ELLs with Disabilities, Designing Effective Classroom  Assessment for ELLs with Severe Disabilities (suffices as Jose P.

Training,  Part 1), New ELL Teacher PD Series: Incorporating the Language Experience Approach (LEA) into Instruction for ELLs with  Severe Disabilities. Beyond district trainings, all staff that serve our ENL and Bilingual departments are encouraged to take part  in trainings and workshops offered at the city level by the Department of English Language Learners (DELLs).  Teacher of ELLs additionally conduct professional workshops in-house pertaining to student placement, collaborative inquiry,  and sharing of best practices.In these sessions, the ELL Compliance person facilitates the ELL staff understanding in the  changes of mandates as per CR Part 154, Furthermore, ELL providers engage in planning committees to design common  practices to be utilized in supporting ELL students through stand alone and integrated models of instruction to norm  operational practices throughout the building. ELL teachers also turn-key information and practices from the before- mentioned district level professional development opportunities as well as plan how outside strategies can be implemented  across all classrooms to support ELLs. These practices help us in ensuring program continuity for our ELLs by coordinating city  mandates, aligning school instruction to educational techniques for ELLs, sharing and turn-keying best practices, and unpacking  student data.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In order to meet the 50% total professional development hours for our ENL and Bilingual Education providers, we conduct  both in-house professional development activities and encourage our providers to attend a minimum of two professional  development workshops at the district level annually. In meeting these hours at the school level, ENL and Bilingual education   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         providers are engaged in several activities on mandated full professional development days as well as meet regularly on a  weekly basis to unpack instructional and best practices as well as compliance information and turn-key professional  development for one another. Additionally, all staff for the ENL and Bilingual program will meet to create specific goals and  assessments for the school curriculum twice per week at the beginning of every instructional unit. Outside sources of  professional development help our teachers of ELLs to develop sound practices as they relate to common core instruction for  ELL students with disabilities.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     In addition to the parent orientation and two parent teacher conference sessions annually, the school provides several  opportunities for parents of ELLs to discuss goals and language development as it relates to their children. On a monthly basis,  the parents meet within the counsel to discuss language development within the curriculum and student goals as they pertain   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70            to the school and individual programs. Additionally, once a month the parents meet with each content area cohort to discuss  how language skills are embedded within the curriculum and discuss additional ways language development can be supported  within the home. Parents of ELLs are also invited to meet the Bilingual and ENL teachers within the school in order to discuss  goals and methodology and are extended an open line of communication throughout the year. Parents are also given the  opportunity meet all BIL and ENL teachers as well as support staff through program meetings held annually from October to  November in 4 separate sessions where school curriculum is discussed in alignment to individual and group needs.  Additionally, the parents of the students who attend the TITLE III after school program are invited to both orientation for the  program as well as events to highlight student learning and progression. Furthermore, as all students within our school have  IEPs, progress in language development for ELLs is discussed in length at each student’s annual review. During annual review  and triennial meetings, parents are informed of student assessment results pertaining to NYSESLAT, SANDI, NYSAA (when  appropriate), and teacher made formative assessment results which are structured into the present levels of performance  section of the IEP for every ELL student.     Records for these meetings and events are kept and reviewed by the team to measure parent involvement and student  progression within the curriculum. Records are kept in various ways including binders for ELL, TITTLE III, Parent Outreach,  Datafolios / SESIS, etc. as well as curriculum and attendance statistics for invitational and open meetings retained within the  school. The records of attendance, encounters, and use of services are kept by the Parent coordinator in addition to the ELL  Compliance Liaison to track and monitor parent attendance for routine and scheduled school functions. All records of parent  contact and ELL documentation are kept by the ELL Compliance Liaison on record within the school and within student  cumulative folders. Provisions for interpretation and translation of information are as follows: All communication with parents  is provided in English and Spanish by school based staff. All written and verbal communication is offered in service from  coordination of events through the use of the city's interpretation and translation services in both written and oral form to  discuss student needs in languages other than Spanish. We have full time staff members to provide interpretation in the  following languages aside from Spanish (French, Haitian/Creole, Italian, Wolof, Bengali, Arabic).    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement is an extremely important part of our program.  Parents are invited to attend PTA meetings and support  groups once a month.  During these meetings our Parent Coordinator assesses the needs of our parents and offers workshops  based on their requests.  Workshop topics that we have given or that are being scheduled based on the evaluation of our  parents needs included social security, guardianship, Medicaid services, health benefits, employment opportunities and  programs for learning English.In addition to the parent orientation and two parent teacher conference sessions annually, the  school provides several opportunities for parents of ELLs to discuss goals and language development as it relates to their  children. On a monthly basis, the parents meet within the PTA and School Leadership Team to discuss language development  within the curriculum and student goals as they pertain to the school and individual programs alongside ENL and Bilingual  service providers in order to further address accommodations and adaptations for the curriculum as well as how they may  reinforce instruction within the home. Parents of ELLs are further supported at annual and unit curriculum meeting in which  school curriculum and instructional design are discussed at length in order to foster continuity and collaboration between  instruction within the school and home, to which resources and instructional support strategies are shared with parents.  Parents of ELLs who attend our TITLE III program additionally are invited to a series of PD and meetings regarding what the  program will entail, goals of the program, etc. and will additionally attend a celebration of learning activity at the end of the  program. Furthermore, parents attend each student’s IEP meeting annually to discuss individual needs of their children and  assist in developing the educational plan for their child as it relates to academic, social emotional, and transition needs. In  addition to these regularly scheduled activities, we have developed a parent resource room for all parents that includes access  to technology, information on services and school instructional foci, as well as provides a space for trainings and workshops. In  these ways parents of ELLs are continually engaged within the school operations on a regular basis in order to discuss student  achievement and transition planning.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rosa Nieves Greene, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 811X                                                                              School DBN: 75X811  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The following methods have been used to assess the school’s needs for translation and interpretation services.   a. The Home Language report on ATS indicates that roughly 40% of our student population has a home language  other than English.   b. Analysis of our Parent Preferred Language Report shows that almost 36% of our parents prefer to have  communication, both written and spoken in a language other than English. Thirty Four percent (34%) of our  parents have indicated a preference of Spanish.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      c. Analysis of our ELL population shows that we have 58 students who are mandated for bilingual services, 89 who  are mandated for ESL services and 120 students who are X-coded and served as per their IEP, indicating 267 total  ELLs.   d. The Ethnic Census report on ATS indicates that over 60% of our student population is of Hispanic origin.   e. The school also uses blue emergency cards to monitor parent contact preference on an annual basis to identify  if any parent members are not able to be contacted by the school in case of an emergency.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    a.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, the school has several provisions in place to reach limited English proficient guardians  and families. Primarily, we utilize emergency blue cards at the beginning of each year to identify parents and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82      guardians as well as family members of LEP families who are able to successfully communicate in English as an  emergency measure if there are no staff members who are capable of interpretation for direct guardians. The main  office additionally has a folder for each non-English and Spanish language, in which in the event of an emergency will  be leveraged by an in-house speaker of the native language in order to call parents in the event of an emergency.  Third, an inventory is kept by the main office of language proficiency for all staff members in order to successfully  delegate family contact to specified individuals in case of an emergency; to which all staff are aware that they may be  needed to contact families. Last, in the case that the above procedures are unavailable due to absenteeism or lack of  third party family members who can interpret for the guardian. the language interpretation unit will be contacted by  the parent coordinator or designated language access coordinator to inform parents of the nature of the emergency.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members will be trained by the parent coordinator and language access coordinator on Chancellor's  Regulations A-663 during the designated professional development day in September prior to the commencement of  the school year. Furthermore, all pertinent information related to the LAP and LTI regarding parent contact will be  shared with all school staff members during this initial training. In addition, staff members will be provided with the  DOE welcome poster to display for parents in their classrooms in order for parent or guardian members to indicate  preferred languages at any face to face meetings, and given contact information for the interpretation and translation  unit for use in daily operations.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      • We have posted a large DOE welcome poster which is translated in the common languages covered by the DOE  which indicates who are parent coordinator is and who our Family Advocates are.   • A sign in the common covered languages has been posted in the main lobby near the welcome poster which lets  that parents know that translation services are available and for families and guardians to indicate language of  preference.    • There are copies on file of the Parents Bill of Rights and the Family Guide in the 8 covered languages in the parent  coordinators office.    • The phone number for Translation services has been distributed to all school personnel (718-752-7373)   • The school will ensure that written communication is translated in the parent’s native language within a reasonable  amount of time.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, the school primarily uses the  parent survey to gain insight into the the quality of communication between the staff and the school. In addition to  the survey, the school examines the attendance rates for school functions and IEP meetings to ensure that effective  communication takes place for vital processes. The school also monitors attendance of students on a weekly basis and  the communication logs of teachers and students to ensure that effective, appropriate, and timely outreach occurs on  a regular basis. The parent coordinator informally collects data related to communication and outreach efforts and  events and maintains the information to share with school leaders. The school leadership team monitors the use of  language translation and interpretation services by the office and classroom staff and compiles data to make informed  decisions regarding school based policies and procedures regarding translation and interpretation needs. Using these  methodologies the school both formally and informally monitors our outreach efforts.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84
