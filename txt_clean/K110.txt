This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement         At PS 110 we dedicate ourselves to the challenge of providing our students with standards-based instructional  programs that empower them to grow into lifelong learners, both academically and socially. While creating  purposeful learning environments where individual needs are supported by our nurturing staff, we provide the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      opportunity to expand horizons through our deep commitment to the arts. We expect our students to be actively  engaged in their own learning as they pursue a rigorous curriculum. In collaboration with school, home and  community we model for our students the behaviors they need to recognize their individuality, as they grow to  respect the individuality of others in our rich culturally diverse society.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We at PS 110 are impassioned in our pursuit of educating the whole child. Our community embodies its mission,  Growing Hearts and Minds, through the many unique initiatives that address the academic, social and emotional  learning of its students.   We have implemented the Ready Gen Literacy Program by Pearson Learning and the Go Math Program by Houghton  Mifflin. Both are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and prepare our students to become college and  career ready. We further enhance literacy instruction through the use of balanced literacy components, including  Teachers College Writing Units, as well as the use of Fundations Phonics in grades K-2.   To further strengthen our literacy curriculum, we will continue with certain strategies. We will continue our work in  reciprocal teaching, a discussion strategy implemented to deepen comprehension. While we will no longer take part  in the 100 Schools’ Initiative in collaboration with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, we will continue  to utilize the writing units to enhance our writing instruction. We will also continue our work in planning rigorous  units of study through the development of essential and guiding questions through a place-based educational  methodology, while pursuing the topic of visible thinking in our professional learning community.    In math, we further enhance instruction through the use of performance based assessments, such as Math Exemplars.  We have also incorporated the ST Math software program in grades 3-5. ST Math is game-based instructional  software for K-12 and is designed to boost math comprehension and proficiency through visual learning.    Both Science and Social Studies address the standards as well through the use of hands-on investigations in Science  and trade books in Social Studies. In the spring of 2016, with funding from both Assemblyman Lentol and the school  budget, we transformed our outmoded science lab into a new STEAM Lab with an Eastern Woodlands focus, which  aligns with our use of McGolrick Park as an outside classroom, as well as our status as an Eco-school in partnership  with the National Wildlife Federation, where our school community is focused on becoming stewards of our  environment through its collaborative sustainability efforts. In addition, the Science Cluster Teacher will continue to  institute the components of Engineering Is Elementary. The science cluster teacher will continue to take advantage of  professional development through the Office of Curriculum, Instruction and Professional Learning, so as to further  develop her craft. We will introduce the Amplify Science curriculum in grades K-5, which was recently adopted for the  2018-2019 school year.    We purchased the NYC DOE’s re-designed Social Studies curriculum in 2016 so as to update and further strengthen  our current curriculum and it will be utilized in the 2018-2019 school year.    All our students enjoy music, computer technology, Italian, and visual arts.   Through the collaborative efforts of teachers, parents, and community organizations we have developed the following  learning opportunities at PS 110: French Dual Language classes in grades K – 5, the addition of a fourth and fifth all  day Pre-K, departmentalized grades 4 and 5 capitalizing on teacher expertise, art residencies for grades K – 5 which  include: Latin Dance, Percussion (Young Audiences of NY), Musical Theater, Ballroom Dancing (Dancing Classrooms,  Inc.) Shakespeare (Theatre for a New Audience), and Mark Morris Creative Movement, and Enrichment Clusters based  on the Renzulli school-wide enrichment model, with a focus this year on the theme of Sustainability.   We will continue to make use of our dance studio and fitness center. The dance studio and fitness center will enable  PS 110 to continue educating the whole child as the space will allow for movement, dance, and yoga classes, as well   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      as opportunities for cardio-vascular activity on the fitness equipment. The PS 110 community is delighted with this  environment as it continues growing the hearts and minds of its students through wellness activities. As part of the PE  Works Initiative, we will have a PE teacher on staff that will address the physical well-being of our children.   We have also partnered with the following organizations to enhance instruction: Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS),  where all students engage in rigorous discussions about works of art to develop critical thinking and communication  skills, Trout Unlimited, where our students conserve, protect and restore North America’s cold water fisheries and  their watersheds, and the Greenpoint Monitor Museum, where our students learn about the Civil War and the role of  Greenpoint in the building of the USS Monitor.   Our partnership with the National Wildlife Federation’s Eco-School Program will enable us to promote environmental  education, connect people with nature and raise awareness about the impacts to people and wildlife from climate  change.   We are in Year 7 in implementation of The Leader in Me, a transformative model of leadership based on Stephen  Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Through this process students learn how to discover their leadership  potential both academically and social-emotionally, as well as recognizing the leadership in others. We expect that  our students will take charge of their own learning. In so doing, all students will create Leadership Notebooks. The  creation of the notebooks provides a tool by which the students can assess their progress in completion of their goals,  as well as celebrate their successes. The process has created a commonality of vocabulary and a like-minded culture.  In the spring of 2017 we were awarded Lighthouse status, which provides us with international recognition in our The  Leader in Me efforts.    Our after school program, sponsored by the North Brooklyn Development Cooperation, provides a seamless transition  from classroom to after school. Once again, in addition to their rich programming, they will also provide the academic  support to those students in grades 3, 4, and 5 who will be taking the NYS tests following the scope and sequence that  our after school program provides. They will also provide our students with arts opportunities through a CASA grant  awarded to PS 110 through the efforts of Council member Stephen Levin. We have also partnered with the following  organizations to provide after-school programming: Wingspan Arts, Williamsburg Arts, Education Francaise a New  York (EFNY), the YMCA, ArtBox Atelier, Eckford Street Studio, Choplet Pottery and Ceramic Studio, Teacup Music,  Brooklyn Children’s Theatre, Nueva York Kiddos, Hamilton Dance, Learn French Brooklyn, MAP After School, WBEE's,  International Ballet Institute, Williamsburg Mixed Martial Arts, and Geek Forest.    Several events have come to embody the PS 110 spirit. These include: Fall Fest, Multicultural Holiday Festival, Night of  the Arts, where our students showcase their arts residencies, the FUNrun, where our PS 110 community walks  together to raise funds for the arts, Spirit Week, Respect for All Week, and Someone Special Day.   PS 110 clearly understands that, for every program which helps the child find a voice and be engaged within the  school community, there is a real world applicability and understanding that is impressed on the child which prepares  him/her to be a productive, active and interested member of his/her community.   These many initiatives and events are made possible through the efforts of our parents and Parent Coordinator, Amy  Chalkley whose collaborative efforts are key to our educating the whole child. Parents have created various  committees which help to provide much needed resources. These committees include: Advocacy, Audit, Budget,  Fund-raising, Grants, Marketing and Outreach, Merchandising, Tours, Website, Wellness, and the Events Committees.  The Grants Committee coordinated efforts for the procurement of electrical upgrades through the Participatory  Budgeting process in Council member Steve Levin’s district, as well as a Computer Lab upgrade through a grant  received from our Brooklyn Borough President, Eric Adams. The Wellness Committee effectively introduced the NYC  DOE Alternative Menu. Family engagement is further enhanced through Family Tuesdays, when parents come to  volunteer in their children’s classes or share their expertise. In addition to our monthly PTA meetings after morning  drop-off, we hold a Family Night pot-luck dinner the same evening to engage parents who are unable to attend the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      morning meeting and bring families together over the bonding of shared food, school news, guest speakers, and a  hands on activity.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our special populations of Students With Disabilities and English Language Learners have specific needs. Both  populations need access to rigorous curriculum with differentiation and modifications so as to enable these students  to achieve the standards required of them while fulfilling required IEP and ENL mandates.    We also must meet the needs of our higher achieving students. We have strived to meet these needs through  differentiated instruction and Enrichment Clusters based the Renzulli Schoolwide Enrichment Model. We need to  continue to address this challenge with additional modes of instruction, such as project-based learning through the  use of Independent Investigation Method, and our RtI period.   One of the challenges we have faced in the past few years has been the result of the shifting population of the  surrounding community. We are highly cognizant of the need to unify the school community in all its facets. For  example, with the introduction of the French Dual Language program, we have worked to ensure that PS 110 is a  community where all stakeholders work together for all our students.   PS 110 truly believes in Growing Hearts and Minds. As a result of our rigorous curricula and learning initiatives, which  address the needs of the whole child, comes the positive rippling effect that it has for the community on a larger  scale. The school was recognized for its efforts in 2011 when it became the recipient of the NYS ASCD Educating the  Whole Child in the 21st Century award, the first New York City Public School to receive this distinction. The NYS ASCD  recognized our abilities in providing a healthy, safe, engaging, supportive, and challenging school environment.  Parents can be certain that their children are being nurtured in an environment that truly provides for their academic,  social, and emotional learning.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In reviewing our most recent preliminary Quality Review Report of 2017-2018, we have the following data to monitor  our future progress:      School Quality Indicators   Instructional Core    Curriculum (1.1)* Well Developed    Findings  School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and strategically  integrate the instructional shifts by embedding challenging tasks. Additionally, rigorous habits and higher-order skills  are integrated vertically in all grades and subjects, including dual language.  Impact  Students experience college and career readiness skills, through a coherent emphasis on tasks that embed academic  language and eco-sustainability in order to demonstrate higher-order thinking in all subjects and grades.    Pedagogy (1.2)* Well Developed -- Area of Celebration   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Findings  Across the vast majority of classrooms, teaching methods strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality  supports and extensions for students through the use of differentiated texts and presentations with their work  products and discussions.  Impact  All learners are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills, participation,  and ownership in their learning.   Assessment (2.2)* Proficient -- Area of Focus   Findings  Teachers use and create assessment measures including rubrics and checklists that are aligned with the school’s  curricula. Additionally, a variety of common assessments are utilized to determine student progress toward grade- level goals.  Impact  Actionable feedback is provided to students on their work, however not all students have a meaningful understanding  of the feedback they receive. Additionally, although common assessments are used to adjust curricula and instruction,  all students have yet to demonstrate increased mastery.      School Culture   Positive Learning Environments (1.4)* Well-developed   High expectations (3.4)* Well Developed    Findings  School leaders and staff systematically communicate high expectations connected to a path to college and career  readiness and successfully partner with families to establish a culture for learning that promotes effective habits for  students.  Impact  Clear, focused, and effective guidance and advisement ensures students meet expectations and own their educational  experience in preparation for middle school and beyond.      Systems for Improvement   Leveraging Resources (1.3)* Well Developed    Goals and Action Plans (3.1)* Well Developed    Teacher Support and Supervision (4.1)* Proficient   Findings  School leaders support the development of teachers with effective, accurate, and timely feedback which clearly  articulates next steps through cycles of observations aligned with the Danielson Framework for Teaching.  Impact  Feedback and next steps to teachers from school leaders promotes instructional practices by increasing both  students’ discourse and their engagement with rigorous tasks through planning, questioning, and discussion.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Teacher teams and Leadership Development (4.2)* Proficient    Findings  The majority of teachers are engaged in weekly, inquiry-based grade collaborations that include addressing student  misconceptions and gaps in instruction through an analysis of assessment data and student work.  Impact  Teachers strengthen their instructional capacity and delivery of lessons while promoting student independence and  high-quality work, specifically in writing.   Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)* Proficient       Finally, an analysis of observations entered into Advance from the 2017- 2018 school year, showed an improvement  in component 3b – Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques. It is clear, however, that in order to improve  student performance, we will need to continue to improve in our questioning and discussion techniques so as to  enable our students to think and then write more critically. We will need to continue to create systems to look for  evidence of growth and gaps and make the necessary adjustments in instruction. In addition, student engagement, in  general, will be a focus area as we continue to move our teachers from effective to highly effective. With this as our  focus, we will continue to design rigorous units of interdisciplinary study in the context of place-based education,  which is defined as learning that is rooted in what is local -- the unique history, environment, culture, economy,  literature, and art of a particular place -- that is, in students' own "place" or immediate schoolyard, neighborhood,  town or community; with an emphasis on the creating of essential and guiding questions that engage the students.                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 14K110   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   523   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The Quality Review Report for 2017-2018 yielded the following findings, with respect to:   Indicator 1.1 -- Ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners  and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards: Well Developed   Findings  School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and strategically  integrate the instructional shifts by embedding challenging tasks. Additionally, rigorous habits and higher-order skills  are integrated vertically in all grades and subjects, including dual language.  Impact  Students experience college and career readiness skills, through a coherent emphasis on tasks that embed academic  language and eco-sustainability in order to demonstrate higher-order thinking in all subjects and grades.   Indicator 1.2 -- Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is  informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and  meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products: Area of Celebration -- Well  Developed   Findings  Across the vast majority of classrooms, teaching methods strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality  supports and extensions for students through the use of differentiated texts and presentations with their work  products and discussions.  Impact  All learners are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills, participation,  and ownership in their learning.   Indicator 2.2 -- Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze  information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels: Area of  Focus -- Proficient    Findings  Teachers use and create assessment measures including rubrics and checklists that are aligned with the school’s  curricula. Additionally, a variety of common assessments are utilized to determine student progress toward grade- level goals.  Impact  Actionable feedback is provided to students on their work, however not all students have a meaningful understanding  of the feedback they receive. Additionally, although common assessments are used to adjust curricula and instruction,  all students have yet to demonstrate increased mastery.   It is clear then, that in order to inform instruction more effectively, we need to continue to employ better questioning  and discussion techniques and create systems to look for evidence of growth and gaps and make the necessary  adjustments in instruction. In turn, as we collaboratively create systems to improve our instructional practices, trust  among all stakeholders is strengthened as everyone works together toward the shared ultimate goal of improving  student outcomes.(QR 1.1, 1.2, 2.2)        Part 2 – Annual Goal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

As such, we have utilized this transformative process of leadership to implement the  7 Habits of Happy Kids in keeping with the DOE's Academic and Personal Behaviors. As a Leader in Me school we  utilized the Lighthouse Rubric 3.0 to yield findings with regards to progress towards Lighthouse status. Lighthouse  status is the premier designation for Leader in Me schools. To achieve Lighthouse Status, schools are evaluated,  utilizing the Lighthouse Rubric, against nine criteria in the categories of:   Lighthouse Rubric   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      Teach Leadership Principles   Create a Leadership Culture   Professional Learning   Leadership Environment   Align Academic Systems  School wide Goal Achievement     On-going Staff Learning     Physical Environment (See)      School Goals     New Staff Learning     Common Language (Hear)     Team Goals     Principal Learning and     Emotional Environment   Modeling   (Feel)      Staff Goals   Student Learning     Direct Learning   Shared Leadership   Student-Led Achievement      Student Leadership Roles      Student Goals      Integrated Approaches      Student Voice      Leadership Notebooks     Modeling     Active Lighthouse Teams      Student Led Conferences   Family Learning   Leadership Events   Empowering Instruction      Family Communication      School wide Events     Teacher Planning and   Reflection     7 Habits Training for Families     Classroom Events     Collaborative Protocols      Student Teaching at Home      Family and Community  Events      Student-Led Learning      Teach Leadership Principles – Professional Learning, Student Learning, Family Learning   Create a Leadership Culture – Leadership Environment, Shared Leadership, Leadership Events   Align Academic Systems – School wide Goal Achievement, Student-Led Achievement, Empowering Instruction      Within these nine categories there are 27 actionable items. The Spring 2016 evaluation of our school, utilizing this  rubric, revealed the following data with the following ratings -- No Evidence, Basic, Developing, Mature, Sustaining:   Teach Leadership Principles – Of the 9 criteria: 11.1% No Evidence, 11.1% Developing, 44.4% Basic, 33.3% Mature   Create a Leadership Culture – Of the 9 criteria: 11.1% No Evidence, 33.3% Developing, 11.1% Basic, 33.3% Mature,  11.1% Sustaining   Align Academic Systems – Of the 9 criteria: 22.2% Developing, 44.4% Basic, 22.2% Mature, 11.1% Sustaining   This data indicates that we achieved an overall 37% at mature and sustaining, utilizing the new more rigorous rubric.  Based on the analysis of this data, we created The Leader in Me Action Teams in the fall of 2016 to address the rubric  -- areas of strength and areas in need of improvement.

This continued improvement  will continue to address the Academic and Personal Behaviors of Persistence, Engagement, Work  Habits/Organizational Skills, Communication/Collaboration Skills, and Self-Regulation, all of which align to Stephen  Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Be Proactive, Begin with the End in Mind, Put First Things First, Think Win  Win, Seek First to Understand, then to Be Understood, Synergize, and Sharpen the Saw. These habits provide our  framework for our work with The Leader in Me process.   It is evident then that our students need to continue to reflect on their work products and habits based on their  understanding of their academic and personal behaviors required for success as they learn content by engaging with  standards-aligned curricula in all content areas.   In turn, as we collaboratively work to address the social emotional learning (SEL) of our school community, trust  among all stakeholders is strengthened as everyone works together toward the shared ultimate goal of improving  student outcomes.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 110, The Monitor School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part  A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 110, The Monitor School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively   support and monitor their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format   and in languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Attendance Records and Program Notification Letters in parents' preferred  languages will be maintained by the Assistant Principal who will be the program supervisor.   The After School Program is designed for grades K-5. This enrichment program will be held on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to 4:15 for a total of 21 hours, or 14 sessions, beginning  February 14, 2019 and ending April 18, 2019.  The After School program will be comprised of 5  classes with no more than 20 students per class, with the following configuration: one class of K  grade students, one class of 1st grade students, one class of 2nd grade students, one class of 3rd  grade students, one class of 4th grade and 5th grade students.  On Wednesday the ENL teacher  will rotate among the 3 content area teachers in grades K-2 and will teach each group for 1/4 of  the allocated time, or approximately 25 minutes. On Thursday, the ENL teacher will rotate  among the 2 content area teachers in grades 3-5. and will teach each group for 1/2 of the  allocated time, or approximately 45 minutes. Direct instruction will be delivered in English  through the flexible groupings model.  In this model, the rationale for grouping is based on the  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT designation, as well as the age of the child.  Grades K-2 will utilize the FUNdations Program, a research-based multi-sensory structured  language program. In addition, components of balanced literacy will be utilized: Shared Reading,  Interactive Writing.  We will also utilize Readers Theatre to promote oral language  development.   Grades 3-5 will utilize EngageNY modules, as well as Ready Gen extension activities and  Readers Theatre.  Again, this year, we will utilize the Visual Teaching Strategies program that uses art work to  promote receptive/expressive language skills, writing skills, and critical-thinking skills.   As part of our Leader in Me program we will integrate the 7 habits into the academic and  personal behaviors of our students.  A supervisor will be funded after school, since this is the only supplementary program at the  school, as noted on Part E budget narrative. The supervisor's regular day work schedule  is:  7:00AM to 2:30PM.

In providing an understanding of social studies  in a place-based framework, the students better understand the content area while being provided  with ample opportunities for language development; for example through the use of partner work  and small group work.   The PD provider is Richard Bluttal, a Social Studies Consultant.  The workshop dates  are:  September 27, 2018, October 11, 2018, October 23, 2018, November 29, 2018, December  12, 2018, January 24, 2019, and February 28, 2019 from 8:30-3:00.

The rationale for  this workshop is to educate parents as to the NYSESLAT and its four components so as to better  enable the parents to successfully support the preparation of their children for this state  assessment. The sessions will include the opportunity for parents to take part in a mock  assessment similar to the grade level of their children. Translation will be provided by parent  facilitators in the necessary home languages. Matthew Jensen will be responsible for maintaining  attendance sheets, agendas, hand-outs, as well as invitations that will be created in parents'  preferred languages.The parents will be notified via flyers backpacked home, as well as our  school website and our Parent Coordinator's weekly e-mails.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses Fountas and Pinnell to assess ELLs early literacy skills.  This data indicates that although many ELLs have  literacy skills in their native language, their English language structures need to be enhanced in order to continue their growth  in the English language.  For example, while they are transferring word attack skills from their native language to English, their  fluency and expressive language must be developed.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures in place to support this effort include:  Reciprocal Reading, Guided Reading,  Differentiated/Scaffolded Instruction, One-on-One Conferencing, Push-in Instruction, and FUNdations.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  As a school community we consistently look at data both vertically and horizontally during both grade conferences and in our  professional learning community which then continually informs our instruction. This data includes the NYS School Report  Card.  Upon analysis of the data, we evaluate the success of the ELL programs s we determine ELLs meeting AYP.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?     Data from formative and summative assessments is utilized to inform RTI instruction. Students are grouped by need based on  formative/summative assessments, which informs instruction. These groups remain fluid as the students are continually  assessed and grouped according to the new analysis of data.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   As described in the RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs we have instituted the following RtI structures during our skills period: Tier 1  is the instructional core that is intended to incorporate high quality evidence-based instruction for all students. This includes  instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and differentiation to meet students’ diverse needs. Instruction for  ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level. Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they  demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also  in separate settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction should also be tailored to  meet ELLs’ language needs and should be incorporated into research-based intervention strategies. Data from formative and  summative assessments is utilized to inform RTI instruction. Students are grouped by need based on formative/summative  assessments, which informs instruction. These groups remain fluid as the students are continually assessed and grouped  according to the new analysis of data.  :        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL data has revealed thus far for new admits: 10 new admits of which 7 are in kindergarten and 1 each in grades 1,  3 and 4.  The NYSITELL data reveals at this juncture that the majority of new students are at the entering level and therefore  the additional supports which will be provided will enable them to achieve transitioning/emerging.      The NYSESLAT data has revealed that 11 students scored at the commanding level, 19 students achieved expanding level, 5  students scored at the transitioning level and 4 scored at the emerging level. The data patterns across proficiency levels and  grades reveal that our ELLs’ greatest need is in the reading and writing modalities.  The patterns across the four modalities will  be instrumental in our instructional decisions.  For example, since the majority of our ELLs’ greatest need is in reading and  writing, we will endeavor to emphasize sklills needed for growth through: shared reading, interactive writing, and guided  reading, which are components of the Balanced Literacy program and are built into our new Literacy program-Ready Gen.  In  addition, strategy lessons in reading and writing will also be employed to further individualize instruction and assist our  students. A skills period built into the schedule also allows for greater differentiation of instruction based on the particular  needs of students.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   To disseminate findings in order to make adjustments to your programs, information is shared at Instructional Cabinet  Meetings, Grade Conferences, Meetings with the ENL Teacher and Classroom Teachers, and PLC's.         Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part   154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one  class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction in the freestanding ENL program is delivered through a pull-out model.  Groups are heterogenously grouped according to  grade level and the instructor differentiates instruction based on the needs  and the level of students' language development.  When  necessary, newcomers across 2 grade levels are grouped together in order to facilitate meeting the needs of entering ELLs.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Our dual language program includes the following:   •an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English   •all content-area courses/subjects are taught in the home language and English   •a home language arts component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’ home language  while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture   •50% of the students are ELLs of the same home language; 50% of the students are not ELLs (former ELLs or never ELLs)   In addition, students are grouped heterogeneously and travel throughout the day as a block.  In this structure the ELL’s receive necessary  instruction in ELA and Math. During the ELA components of the curriculum, Reading, Writing and Word Work, as well as Math,  instruction is delivered whole group, small group and one-on-one.  In addition, the needs of the students are being met during skills  period, where students are grouped homogeneously based on need. During this period all staff members are involved in small group  instruction. Students are assessed often and the results are used to inform instruction and create new groups as needed. For example,  based on running records, students are grouped and receive the necessary instruction to help them move to the next level in their  independent reading.  In Kindergarten, first and second grades we are utilizing the side-by-side model and in grades 3 and 4 the classes  are self-contained.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)?   As staff members prepare their schedules, they strive to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes will be delivered to their  students during the course of the school day as each student receives the necessary instruction in a particular subject.  These schedules are  discussed horizontally in grades K-3 to ensure that the needs of the students are meet. In grades 4 and 5 the schedules are discussed both  horizontally and vertically as are 4th and 5th grades departmentalize across the core subjects of ELA and Math.  The 5 proficiency levels for ELLs  and units of study per proficiency level is outlined below:     CR Part 154 Requirements for English as a New Language*, Grades K to 8   Levels (as of 2015-16 SY)       Total # Minutes ENL       Minimum # minutes       Minimum # minutes                                                             standalone ENL                    integrated ENL       Flexibility: Minimum #  minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    standalone  or integrated ENL     Entering                  360                         180                               180 integrated                        0                                                                                                                   ENL/ELA                                                                             Emerging                360                           90                                180 integrated                    90                                                                                                                   ENL/ELA      Transitioning          180                               0                                  90 integrated                   90                                                                                                                  ENL/ELA      Expanding        180                                  0                          180 integrated                     0                                                                                                                  ENL/ELA or other content area         Commanding**       90                               0                                90 integrated                        0                                                                                                                 ENL/ELA or other content area            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make   content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.   We will utilize the NYS Bilingual Common Core Initiative to deliver core content.  As per the initiative, The New and Home Language Arts  Progressions are designed to help all teachers plan instruction and develop appropriate expectations for students at different levels of language  and literacy levels. The development of academic language rests on conten tarea texts. Teachers will target grade appropriate text and develop  strategies to provide multiple points of entry for their students. The following are some examples of how teachers will use the progressions to  plan and assess language.  • Differentiate linguistic scaffolds that students will require: Entering students for example, will be able to develop their listening, reading,  speaking and writing skills by focusing on key words in text, while Emerging students will focus on key phrases and short sentences in the new  language. Transitioning students will need less explicit teaching of language and can replicate models, while Expanding students can be supported  with tools such as glossaries while Commanding students can be expected to work more independently. All students  will be working within the same content area, but the teacher will be able to create different supports for the students to access the content and  the academic language that is integral to the content area.  • Determine the specific scaffolds that target the content area demands: Recognizing the precise way in which content should be broken down  for students learning a new language or developing their home language is key for selecting scaffolds. Using a cause and effect graphic organizers  is essential for understanding historical events. Sequencing becomes essential for understanding how a specific cycle works in science. Rubrics  can be useful for assessing the reliability of a source and summarizing is essential for  distinguishing the main idea from unimportant details in a text. The Progressions can support teachers in understanding how to create content  area scaffolds such as graphic organizers, sentence starters and rubrics that target the content area standard and match the students’ language  ability in the new or home language.  • Develop formative assessments according to levels: Knowing what students should be able to do at each level create benchmarks against which  to measure progress. If, for example, a student should be able to integrate information from the text into a graphic organizer with the support of  only a word bank, a formative assessment can include that scaffold and the teacher can recognize if the  student needs more support, or if the student is ready to move to the next level. Similarly, teachers will develop rubrics to assess the ability of  students to participate in partnership, small group or whole class discussions and measure  progress over time.  • Develop specific language objectives: The linguistic demands within the Progressions will facilitate for planning for integrating language as a  teaching goal. Teachers will be able to plan for the specific language that a unit demands. For instance, knowing the words that are necessary for  introducing cause and effect (i.e. because of, due to, when) will reinforce and clarify the content area  concepts and thus help guide teachers to language development for the content.     It is important to note that the Progressions will be used by teachers working in content area classrooms with students learning English. In such  classrooms, teachers will use the new language progressions to develop literacy and language in academic  settings within their content area.     Core content is delivered through the following instructional methods: whole group, small group, and one-on-one.  As the needs of the students  are assessed various methods of delivery may be utilized, which include, but are not limited to:  peer tutoring and technologically assisted  instruction.  Materials to be utilized in each program include: ReadyGen, GoMath, and Kamamila Phonics.  Native Language support will include academic and content area dictionaries and glossaries as well as peer-tutoring.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELL’s are appropriately evaluated in their home languages during mandated assessments through the use of translators as well as through the  use of the GBTrousse Program.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiation of instruction is provided for the following ELL subgroups: SIFE, Newcomers, Developing, Long Term and Former ELLs.  These  students receive whole group, small group, and one-on-one instruction throughout the course of the school day based on need through the  analysis of data.  These needs will be addressed through scaffolding as we support ELL achievement in the subgroups:  In literacy we will:  Unpack Oral Language and its components:      Vocabulary (understanding the meaning of words and phrases)a  Syntax (understanding word order and grammar rules)  Morphological skills (understanding the meaning of word forms and parts)  Pragmatics (understanding the social rules of communication)  Phonological skills (an awareness of sounds, such as syllables and rhymes)        Unpack vocabulary, including core and extended vocabulary      Unpack academic vocabulary:   We will SELECT WORDS TO TEACH THAT APPEAR MULTIPLE TIMES IN CURRICULAR MATERIALS AND ARE ESSENTIAL FOR COMMUNICATING THE  KEY LEARNINGS FROM THE UNIT.  We will TEACH ACADEMIC WORDS WITHIN THE CONTEXTS IN WHICH THEY ARE USED AS ABRIDGE TO TEACHING ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC  LANGUAGE FEATURE AND WORLD KNOWLEDGE.  We will FOSTER MASTERY OF ACADEMIC WORDS AND PROMOTE ‘WORD CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH AUTHENTIC TASKS  (DISCUSSIONS, WRITING) AND ENGAGING TEXTS.     Address disciplinary literacy:  We will pay particular attention to vocabulary, grammar, and text structures.     Address text complexity:  We will pay particular attention to lexical level, sentence level, and discourse level.     Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL. All ELLs and former ELLs will receive the mandated testing accomodations, which typically  includes a separate location and time and a half for completion of the assessment.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and   accelerate English language development?   The curricula utilized by the school, Ready Gen and Go Math, provide both materials and strategies for access to academic content areas and to  propel the acceleration of English language development.  Lesson plans reflect this utilization of both materials and strategies. In addition we are  utilizing the Really Great Reading - Tools for Struggling Readers: Blast, Blitz, and Boost as recommended by Dr. Kate Garnett, Professor of Special  Education and Learning Disabilities, Chair of The Special Education Department of Hunter College.  Teachers also utilize RAZ-Kids technology for  individualized instruction. The SIT Team and the SBST help to ensure that all ELLs-SWDs receive all mandated services on their IEPs as well as  mandated ESL instruction.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English   proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   The school utilizes curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL – SWD’s to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency  within the LRE as follows:  all facets of the curricula are implemented and modified to meet the needs of these students, so that instructional  objectives are attained as per the Common Core Learning Standards. Scheduling allows for the support of Special Education teachers as per the  IEP, as well as related service providers. All staff is in 408 compliance and is aware of the academic, socio-emotional needs of our ELL-SWD’s. The  unique structure of our skills period ensures that flexible scheduling is used to maximize time spent with their non-disabled peers.  This skills   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      period is a fluid environment that allows for individualized and small group work.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted).  List the range   of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered.  Utilizing the NYC DOE RtI framework we provide robust RtI practices in our school.  RtI supports the use of differentiated instruction that is  matched to student needs and incorporates increasingly intensive interventions for students not making satisfactory progress (based on screening  and progress monitoring data). Targeted, small-group (Tier 2), and intensive, individual (Tier 3) interventions are provided in addition to the core  instruction all students receive (including in-class interventions delivered by the regular classroom teacher in Tier 1). The multi-tiered instructional  delivery model includes a range of supplemental interventions with increasing levels of intensity to address these needs. Each tier is distinguished  from the other based on:   Size of instructional group;   Mastery requirements for content;   Frequency and focus of screening;   Duration of the intervention;   Frequency and focus of progress monitoring;   Frequency of intervention provided; and   Instructor qualifications   The three-tiered model for instruction and support ensures students in each of the three tiers are receiving the necessary intervention with  appropriate frequency and duration to address needs.  Materials utilized include: Fundations and Wilson for ELA and reading in the content areas,  inclusive of Social Studies and Science content. Additionally, we also utilize the supplemental materials in the FOSS Science Kits and Engineering Is  Elementary. Supplemental materials in Go Math, as well as strategies learned through Metamorphosis training address math needs.  In addition,  Reciprocal Teaching and Visual Thinking Strategies provide further instructional support to meet the needs of our students.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year, Fundations phonics program is being utilized in grades K and 1 so as to better meet the needs of our youngest ELLs as use and analysis  of the Ready Gen phonics program showed gaps in the program’s delivery of effective instruction.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in your building.   ELLs are invited to all after school programs, both academic and recreational.  They are invited to the Saturday academies, extra support  programs after school as well as the walking club and the fitness club. The after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in our building  include: North Brooklyn Development Corporation, which addresses both academic and recreational needs, and Wingspan which addresses  recreational needs.  All ELLs participate in all art residencies, which address movement, dance, musical theatre, percussion and Shakespeare.  In  addition ELLs are afforded the opportunities for leadership roles through our school-wide initiative, The Leader in Me.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language materials; list ELL   subgroups if necessary.  Raz kids, Brainpop and Time for Kids are utilized for informational reading materials.  These software programs address academic needs in the  areas of ELA, MAth, Social Studies, and Science.  In addition,  teachers use their SMARTboards and class computers to deliver technology- enhanced lessons.  Students are engaged in varied  instructional activities utilizing technology, including the use of IPads for guided reading  instruction.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Dual Language kindergarten, Grade 1 and Grade 2 programs the instruction is delivered utilizing a side by side method of instruction.  In  third and fourth grades, the instruction is delivered by one bilingual instructor. The native language is presented for 50% of the school day. In the  Dual Language Program, native materials include French classroom libraries and the Kamamila Phonics Program.  In the ENL program native  language dictionaries and glossaries as well as peer-translators are utilized for home language support.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instruction as mandated by the NYC DOE of education is age and grade level appropriate. When necessary, modifications are made to  instruction to ensure that the needs of the students are being met with age-appropriate and leveled materials..        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs’ needs   (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for new ELLs who enroll   throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, parent coordinator).   All staff members offer new students assistance.  There are speakers of French, Polish, Spanish, Italian , and Arabic  on the school staff. The parent  coordinator, the school secretary, the aides, the administration , and all classroom teachers foster a welcoming and friendly environment new  students  feel at home and accepted.  Classroom teachers pair newly arrived ELLs with a buddy/partner to ensure that the new ELL becomes  engaged in school life. All students participate in all school activities, special classes such as computers, art, and music.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All students receive Italian instruction which is provided by a cluster teacher once a week.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day (percentage) EPs and   ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same time (simultaneous)?   a.   A side-by-side model is used for the French Dual Language Kindergartens, Grade 1 and grade 2 while the  third and  fourth grades are taught in self-contained classes.  In the side-by-side model of instruction, full day French or English  instruction alternates each day. Dual language programs foster bilingualism, biliteracy, enhanced awareness of linguistic  and cultural diversity, and high levels of academic achievement through instruction in two languages.   b.   In kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grades each core content area is taught in both English and French. In the 3  rdand 4   th   Grade French Dual Language classes Common Core Literacy Standards are taught in French.  The teacher utilizes  French materials to cover the Standards in French.  Science topics are also taught in French. Math, Social Studies, and ELA  are taught in English in the afternoon.  Unit tests are utilized to assess student progress. Also, the GBTrousse Program is  used to assess reading levels.  c.   The early childhood grades utilize a color scheme to differentiate between the French and English language.  Yellow  paper designates French, while white indicates English.  The classrooms are also divided: one side is French, while the  other half is English.     d. Emergent literacy is taught simultaneously.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers of ELLs participate in weekly professional learning communities whereby they study topics that will support their  teaching of ELLs. 50% of ELL teachers' PD will be on topics about best practices for ELL instruction. The PD committee  comprised of teachers determined the topics the staff will study across the year in professional learning communities. The  chosen topics specifically address the issue of how best to support ELLs across varied subjects.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69            Here is the Professional Development Plan:  Monday Professional Learning Communities  2017-2018     Essential Question:   How does the utilization of essential and guiding questions in the development of a more rigorous unit of study impact student  learning and achievement?    Each PLC will study the definition of rigor, develop a rigorous unit of study, implement the unit, analyze and evlautate the  student work produced through the unit and, then, re-implement this cycle of learning.     The dates for Monday PLC are: 9/11, 9/18/, 9/25, 10/2, 10/16,10/23 10/30, 11/6, 11/13, 11/20, 11/27, 12/4, 12/11, 12/18,  1/8, 1/22, 1/29, 2/5, 2/12, 2/26, 3/5, 3/12, 3/19, 3/26, 4/9, 4/16, 4/23, 5/7, 5/14, 5/21, 6/4, 6/18, 6/25     In addition, pedagogical staff, as well as non-pedagogical staff, will avail itself of professional development opportunities  offered both through the Borough Field Office and central, where applicable.      Teachers of ELLs and biligual teachers are provided with various opportunities to attend professional development offered by  both the district and city-wide conferences and symposiums. The French Embassy also hosts many lectures on topics of  bilingualism,  and language acquisition.  These professional development opportunities include: workshops,  lectures, and  intra/inter-class visitations.  Prior to attendance at PD opportunities, we determine whether these PD offerings will present information to support  teachers in delivering Common Core-aligned instruction, which is essential to the achievement of ELLs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Visits to the local middle schools by 5  th   grade teachers and administration provide the staff with support for students  transitioning into middle school.  Students visit local middle schools with their parents as well as with their class in order to  familiarize themselves with the requirements and challenges of a new school.  PS 110 also departmentalizes their 4  th   and 5   th   grades, so students leave PS 110 with the experience of moving from class to class and working with many teachers. In  addition the Guidance Counselor attends PD opportunities specifically pertaining to the aspects of her position, which helps  her in her support of the ELLs as they transition into middle school.  Our school will provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of  English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers  prescribed by CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new  language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours will be dedicated to  language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.      Teachers must document all of their professional learning activities with agendas and attendance sheets .  A new system of  documenting agendas on google documents is being implemented this school year.  All professional development activities will  directly benefit ELLs as teachers are cognizant that they continue to learn so that they can help move students along, develop,  and achieve English proficiency as well as academic targets as set by the common core learning standards.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the scheduled parent-teacher conferences, teachers  communicate with families about student progress through  interim report cards.  Each classroom also has a class portal whereby parents can view class activities and  homework.  Additional individual conferences are arranged and take place during parent-engagement time Tuesday  afternoons or before school if that is more convenient for working parents. Parents also make individual appointments to  discuss their child's progress throughout the school year.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs are invited and participate in many school functions which are specifically designed to promote parent  involvement.  They attend Monthly Family Tuesdays, Family Nights held the first Wednesday of every month, Mother' and  Father's Day celebrations, Holiday Fair, Culminating Arts Residency Events, and Night of the Arts.  They are encouraged to  attend the adult ESL classes which are held in the school every morning from 8:30-12:30.   These functions are planned and  organized by the Parent Coordinator.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anna Cano Amato, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Monitor School                                                                              School DBN: 14K110  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
