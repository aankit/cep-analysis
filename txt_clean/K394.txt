The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At our school, we are devoted to using data and feedback as our tools for setting long term and short term goals to  monitor student success and provide instructional support as needed. We will ensure staff receives ongoing  professional development in best practices to enhance their pedagogy so they are equipped to aid our students in  meeting their maximum potential. We are committed to providing forums for staff, students, and parent to express  their ideas on how we can work collaboratively as a school, providing each stakeholder with a voice in the decision  making process and daily running of our school. We understand that each student will only achieve their maximum  potential when we are a school dedicated to improving student achievement through determination, teamwork,  mutual respect of ideas, and clarity of our craft. As a result, we will produce citizens who are prepared with the tools  to become career and college ready, thus be equipped to handle the trials life will present as they mature into young  men and women.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Mary McLeod Bethune School 394 is a Pre-K through 8 school with 476 students. The school population  comprises 4.2% Asian, 72.8% Black, 18.07% Hispanic, 3.7% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and .084% White  students. Boys account for 43.7% of the students enrolled and girls account for 56.3%.      We are also known as the Academy for Mathematics, Science, Technology & Performing Arts. Our students  participating in State Mathematics and English Language Arts State Assessments as well as Algebra 1 and Living  Environment Regents. Some students graduate with High School Regents. Our grades 3-8 students receive instruction  in a foreign language.       Because our world is becoming one based in technology, most of our classrooms are equipped with computers or the  availability of a laptop cart. We recently received a grant matching funds to be able to purchase a Smart board in  every room in order to incorporate technology into each classroom. Our teachers integrate the use of smart-boards  and or document cameras to enhance their daily lessons.    We are proud to have maintained community partnerships as well as fostered new partnerships. Some community  partnerships that continue to be woven into the fabric of PS\MS 394 are: Lincoln Center, Curiosity Machine S.T.E.M.  Program, Parent Corp-Pre K\K, and My Library. Some of the most recent partnerships we have been able to develop  are: Friends of Crown Heights-DOE After-School Initiative, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Parent Corp,  Response To Intervention Project, and Eagle Academy Foundation.      In recent data, it was noted that math and writing were areas in need of improvement. We have implemented several  initiatives to improve student performance around these areas. For writing, we use the Benchmark Writing program,  which supports teaches working with students at all stages of writing development, from young children just  beginning to scribble messages to skilled writers who can fluently express ideas through well-organized, well crafted  written works across a range of genres.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      For math, we use GoMath for grades K-8 to provide continuity throughout the school on Math practices. We have  secured the services of Shane Purse Associates to provide pedagogical support to extend and deepening both  teachers’ and students’ thinking surrounding the application of mathematics concepts contextually and in the real  world. I have purchased GoMath for grades six to eight to create cohesion in our math program from grades K-8. We  have also created a cluster position for providing small group instruction using both the push-in and pull-out model  provide enrichment and support for students. Teachers in grade 6, 7, and 8 also utilize the push-in/pull-out model to  provide additional support of the GoMath curriculum.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 7.7% English Language Learners and 12.82% students with disabilities.    We have one ENL teacher that supports our English language learners with a push in and pull out model. Our ELL  students are supported with a rigorous common core curriculum that is modified to fit their needs with an emphasis  on building their vocabulary, speaking listening and writing skills. Our ELL students receive guided reading instruction  and take part in after-school activities.       Our students with disabilities have IEPs (Individual Education Plans) that allows them to be supported with services to  meet their individual needs. We offer speech services, occupational therapy, physical therapy, S.E.T.S.S, 12:1:1 (Self- contained class with 12 students, 1 teacher and 1 paraprofessional) and ICT classes (Integrated Collaborative  Teaching).       We are continuing with the Achieve 3000 program, a computer based, differentiated reading program, for our ELL and  SWD students to continue our goal of using technology to enhance student learning. The student receives  differentiated, grade-appropriate, non-fiction passages, matched to his/her individual Lexile level. In the program  students complete regular assessments aligned to grade-level standards, which measure his/her ability to  comprehend informational text. As a student progresses through activities for the semester his/her reading abilities  are evaluated, and the text rigor is increased when progress is detected. What is exciting about Achieve 3000 is it is a  computer based program that modifies as the student improves.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our strengths are in strong community and family ties. School leadership brings resources from the community into  the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and  community-based organizations. Organizations such as Friends of Crown Heights, the after-school program, Lincoln  Center, a program designed to bring the arts into the classrooms, Parent Corp. designed to improve parent/child  relationships in grades PreK-K, Champs, a basketball program for grades 3-5, and Brooklyn Ballers for grades 6-8, and  Triad Consulting for College Access for All.      Our next steps for improvement are creating a collaborative environment, were teachers are committed to the  success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. This year, we gave a survey to teachers to indicate their  needs for professional improvement. Using this survey, we have created professional activities which address  teachers' pedagogical practice as well as student improvement. We will provide tailored professional development  opportunities, based on current data and teachers strengths and weaknesses, to aid in the development of an  instructional culture of respect and continuous improvement both in our school and outside.

The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers by using a variety of programs which promotes student collegiality. We have adapted components of  Eagle Academy, a program which is designed to promote positive relationships for males of color. It is also teaches  students to work collaboratively by utilizing teamwork, building self-esteem, and trust. At our school, we have tailored  this program to meet the needs of our male and female population and improve interpersonal skills in grades 5-8. We  have also adopted the PBIS program (Positive Behavior Intervention Services) to create an atmosphere of mutual respect  and citizenship through incentives for students to become role models of success and agents of change in the school  culture. Using the STARS (Strive for success, Treat other with respect, Act responsibly, Respect your environment, Stay  safe at all times) matrix as their goal for improvement and behavior management system, students are encouraged to  adhere to these character building traits daily. G.E.M, (Girls Empowerment Movement) teaches our female students to  use their voice to empower change and display pride and dignity in everything they do. We have monthly assembly  programs to promote a sense of community, honor students who have been high achievers, reinforce speaking and  listening skills, and foster collegiality and respect for one another.

To  provide intramural sports activities, we also have a partnership with Champs, an after-school basketball program for our  third through fifth graders. Finally, we have obtained grants for instructional activities to improve student academics. This  year we purchased Achieve 3000, a digital reading program which builds reading strength and stamina through close  reading of rigorous informational text with targeted scaffolding to support our struggling readers. We also are continuing  Curiosity Machine/STEM Program, a program which exposes children to careers in science and engineering by  participating in building engineering design challenges using household objects, with the help of scientists and engineers.         Our next steps for improvement in the area of supportive environment are to implement a working student government  which will become the voice of the student body. The student government will have regular meetings with a staff advisor,  who will help them articulate their needs in the form of a bi-monthly newsletter. This newsletter will outline student  needs, concerns, and areas for change for the improvement of school culture. Student government members will also be  required to do community service to make connections to the importance of citizenship, pride, and respect for their  surrounding community.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  The transition plans used at MS 394 include, but are not limited to the following:   ● At the end of the Pre K school year, Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten teachers meet and draft a welcoming letter  to parents to talk about expectations for Kindergarten. This letter also contains a list of supplies, recommended  reading material, a prospective trip list and other important information pertaining to the Kindergarten school year.   ● During the school year, Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers and students conduct inter-visitation of classes to enable  Pre-Kindergarten students to become comfortable with the Kindergarten teachers and the environment.   ● At the beginning of the school year, Pre-Kindergarten teachers meet with Kindergarten teachers to continue to  discuss end-of-year (for current year) expected fluency's in core subjects.   ● During the school year, Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten teachers use a crosswalk to compare Next Generation  Learning Standards between grades and share samples of student work.   ● Teachers of Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten receive ongoing professional development provided by our Field  Support Office, Department Of Education, paid consultants and administrators.    ● Teachers of Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten compare curriculum and standards, share ideas and strategies  during common planning sessions.   ● Pre-Kindergarten teachers meet with all parents and students who are entering Pre-Kindergarten for the upcoming  school year. The parents are given a tour of the school by the Parent Coordinator, while the children are allowed to  visit the rooms.   ● A parent questionnaire is provided to collect information from parents about their child.   ● Pre-Kindergarten teachers offer parent workshops to the incoming parents on the prerequisite skills needed to  enter kindergarten.   ● Pre-Kindergarten teachers share information with parents pertaining to separation anxiety and strategies to use to  make the students comfortable.   ● All pre-kindergarten students are screened with the ESR-I to determine readiness or the need for early intervention.  CLASS/ECERS are used to evaluate the effectiveness of Universal Pre-K programs   ● The school psychologist and social worker provide “Turning 5” conferences to parents.   ● Student records are made accessible to both the Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten teachers.   ● The Individual Education Program teacher meets with all incoming special education parents during registration to  ensure that services will be provided from the first day of school.     Work Sampling System information collected from Pre-Kindergarten is given to the receiving Kindergarten    teacher.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46        The school social worker observes the students in the classrooms, discusses observations with parents,    teachers and make recommendations and or referrals to CPSE.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     School-wide assessments are often provided by the Department Of Education, however, additional assessments are  used to determine student performance and measure student growth. Teachers are included in the decision making  process regarding the selection and use of additional multiple assessment measures in the following ways:    ● Groups of teachers analyze components of available assessments and make recommendations for selection to the  administrative staff.    * Teachers and administrators collaborate to determine Measures Of Student Learning assessment selection.   ● Professional development is provided to teachers pertaining to assessment results in the following areas:   (a) conducting item skills analyses   (b) identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses by student, class and grade, for assessments taken   (c) creating plans to address these critical areas of weaknesses during common planning sessions creating lessons  with the purpose of re-teaching the areas of weaknesses during classroom time, the Early Intervention Services   (d) review and analyze student work samples to identify strengths and weaknesses, then create SMART goals for  impacting student performance           4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K394, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.          Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   17K394 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      ● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● Supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)       17K394, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    Early literacy skills for ELL's are assessed utilizing CORE ( Consortium for Reading Excellence), Scholastic, Slosson Oral Reading  Test, Fountas and Pinnell, DRP and MSQI. Insights from early screening and assessment reflect the skill level obtained from  either NYSITELL or NYSESLAT assessments.  Those students earning a designation of beginner are also at the beginning in early  literacy skills.  Students are supported with computer programs (Achieve 3000) which assist in gaining early literacy skills as  well as, listening centers and leveled/phonological readers.  Literacy lessons and activities are planned within a UDL framwork  in order to assist students to gain access to content material.  Data from NYSESLAT '17, NYSITELL as well as data from the ELA  exam indicates an overall need for explicit instruction in vocabulary and reading comprehension skills.  Both expanded       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58         vocabulary and reading comprehension strategies (Achieve 3000, IXL and Guided Reading) would support the higher order  thinking requirement for the common core curriculum.  MS 394's instructional plan addresses this need for the ELL population  through additional small group instruction, teacher team co-planning and frequent progress monitoring to assure student  progress.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ENL programs will be evaluated through various instruments including:  NYSESLAT, Scholastic, CORE  (Consortium for Reading Excellence), F&P, IXL Assessments, Achieve 3000 Assessments, NYC Performance Assessment, New  York State ELA and Math (Grades 3-8), state science test, state social studies test, teacher evaluation and progress  monitoring.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students will receive Guided Reading Instruction three times a week as well participate in technology intervention programs,  IXL and Achieve 3000.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Ongoing progress monitoring by the RTI team as well as classroom assessment data is utilized to guide instruction within an  RTI framework.  Students are given targeted instruction in order to address areas of deficit.  The RTI framework consists of l.  A  strong Tier 1 core program, 2.  Small group for Tier 2 intervention and individualized instruction for Tier 3.  Students are  screened and progress monitored Guided Reading, Fundations, IXL and Achieve 3000).  Students who are in lowest l/3 of the  class receive small group instruction targeted to individual needs. Students receive additional instruction in areas of weakness  during one period three times per week .  SETTS is provided for students deemed at risk.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT and NYSITELL student data is reported across the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and  writing.  Individual student scale scores for NYSESLAT is reported for each tested modality.  In addition, individual scale scores  are compared to a state average scale score.The data pattern across proficiency levels of NYSITELL and NYSESLAT reveal the  need for the development of academic language in conjunction with higher order thinking skills.  Student data from NYSESLAT  reflects a need for explicit instruction in the organization and mechanics of writing in order for students to be able to write  about literary and informational texts and topics.  Explicit instruction is also needed in Mathematics (problem solving). In  addition, explicit instruction in academic vocabulary and reading comprehension strategies would support student writing.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   There will be quarterly benchmark assessment along with the assessment of reading levels 3 times during the school year. As  students use Achieve 3000 and IXL the system will track their progress and design supports for their individual needs. The  supports team will meet monthly to evaluate student progress, The ENL teacher will be a part of teacher teams to collaborate,  review assessment and plan for students.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1.  The students are placed in age/grade appropriate educational settings giving consideration to all placement  criteria. Students who need stand alone ENL service receive standard based literacy instruction (ELA) to support  English language growth across all modalities.  Students who have acquired further proficiency receive an integrated  model of delivery whereby language growth is supported through core content areas such as science, social studies  and mathematics.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Based upon students' NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores and in accordance with CR Part 154.1/154.2, students at the entering  level of language acquisition receive 180 minutes weekly of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA for a total  of 360 minutes weekly. Students at the emerging level receive 90 minutes weekly of standalone ENL, 180 minutes weekly of  integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes weekly of ELA and core content instruction for a total of 360 minutes.  Students at the  transitioning phase of development receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes integrated ENL coupled with  core content instruction to build academic vocabulary. Students at the expanding level receive 180 minutes weekly of  integrated ENL/ELA instruction utilizing core content. Students at the commanding phase of development receive 90 minutes  of integrated ENL/ELA instruction utilizing core content to support academic growth.  Students native language is supported  through use of web based programs (Achieve 3000 translates text), glossaries and dictionaries.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The English language is utilized in the classroom across all content areas.  Grade level content area instruction is supported in  the ENL classroom. The use of graphic organizers, sheltered language, checklists, peer review, web based programs and front  loaded explicit instruction assist in scaffolding the student learning experience in order to foster language development  generally and academic language specifically. Content area vocabulary is chunked within context.  Formative and summative  assessments of academic language in specific content areas either highlights a need for further instruction, or assures that the  student has mastered the vocabulary.  Pre-reading and discussion of academic language needed for content areas assists  students in accessing grade level material and complex informational texts.  Additionally explicit instruction in the conventions  of Standard English as used in writing and reading prepares students for further academic demands.  The above is in alignment  with the college and career readiness anchor standards for language (CCRASL).      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Although ELL's do not participate in on-going assessment or progress monitoring of their respective native languages, new  admits who are Spanish speakers are administered the Spanish LAB in order to assess their native language literacy skills.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  When learning gaps of two years or more in a student's ability to perform successfully are identified by teaching staff we  take the following steps to ensure that there is intervention for that student as follows:  -   Intensive English language instruction teaching social and academic language in small group settings.  -   Intensive literacy development  -   Access to web based programs that building working vocabulary and addressing strategies  -   Newcomer support within the school aimed at building an academic foundation for students  -   Modified scheduling  -   Providing additional ENL techniques to attending staff  -   Collaboration between ENL and classroom teachers  -   Integrated cultural activities and programs giving students a spotlight to share  -   Recognition of student's native language and culture  b.  The instructional plan for those English language learners who are considered newcomers is as follows:  -   Intensive English language development instruction teaching social and academic language in small group settings  -   ELA and content instruction/support  -   Title III after-school program  -   Spring Break tutoring  -   Individual tutoring  -   Language development (phonological/phonemic support and activities)  -   Cooperative learning  c.  Both ENL and classroom teachers utilize a balanced literacy program which consists of:  -   shared reading  -   guided reading  -   literacy centers  -   literature circles  -   writer's workshop  -   interactive read aloud  -   vocabulary word study  -   cooperative learning  -   Title III after school program  -   Integrated cultural activities  d.  English language learners who have completed 6+ years will consistently receive  their mandated minutes according to  English acquisition level.  During this time, standard English is explicitly taught across curriculum content areas.  Literacy  instruction is infused in all content areas such as ELA, social studies, science and mathematics.  e.  Former English language learners in years one and two after assessing at the commanding level still benefit from extended  time on high stakes assessments.  In addition, students receive 90 minutes weekly of ENL/ELA (or other core content area)  instruction.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instruction strategies and grade level materials used by teachers of ELL-SWDs which provides access to academic content  areas and accelerates language development are:  classroom libraries which support the four modalities of language  acquisition.  Books on tape, leveled readers and culturally orientated material are utilized to bridge and support English  acquisition. The UDL (universal design) framework allows students to access core curriculum and literacy instruction.  The ENL  teacher will use a variety of texts and resources to enhance language acquisition in keeping with the CCSS and the DOE       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      initiative to design a rigorous and coherent curriculum with literacy and math tasks for all students and with specific  instructional expectations to build on inquiry work to prepare students to be college and career ready.  Utilizing differentiation  of instruction, grade level material for content areas is presented through various modes of media, ie. smart boards, laptops,  powerpoints, educational websites and films.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals within the least restrictive  environment through collaboration of all staff involved.  Collaboration of teachers utilizing guided reading and UDL framework  ensures that ELL-SWDs are given every opportunity to access core content material through various physical modalities. Least  restrictive environment is ensured by scheduling lessons in various other environments ie. computer lab, library and  auditorium.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     Spire is utilized for targeted students whose progress needs additional support. Stars is utilized as a screening assessment,  which also includes a progress monitoring piece as well as, targeted intervention tools. Fountas and Pinnell is also available for  ongoing progress monitoring.  For specific targeted areas CORE (Consortium on Reading Excellence) assessments will be  utilized. Go Math and Ready Gen are utilized for math and ELA core content. GoMath includes an intensive intervention  component providing diagnostic practice for needed prerequisite skills (following an RTI model).  ReadyGen also includes a  remediation/intervention component and addresses the difficulties that English language learners often face when acquiring a  second language.  In Social Studies and Science, theme-based materials are used giving students real time experience with  hands-on activities.  Students are also exposed to IXL and Achieve 3000 are able to utilize the programs in either school or  home environment.  Specific ELL's are targeted when performance falls within the lowest one-third of the population and  given additional small group instruction in the deficit area.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our partnership with Lincoln Center will provide students with exposure to the arts in various forms.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No present programs or service for ELLs are scheduled to be discontinued during the 2017-2018 academic year.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Students are given access to all programs, services and extra-curricular activities.  The general education staff is given  appropriate support and professional development to assist ELL students effectively.  A math club, ELA club, exercise club,  basketball team, Girls Chat and various social clubs are offered.  Invitations are extended to all students including English  language learners who participate in the math club, exercise club and social clubs some of which are taught by bilingual  staff.  English language learners whose scores fall within the bottom third are especially encouraged to join.  Clubs which are  led by bilingual staff not only supports the English language learner in acquiring academic skills in the English language, but  supports the English language learner's native language as well.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  English language learners are supported through the use of regular computer usage, use of computer lab, smart boards and  media.  Classrooms contain books on tape, leveled readers and culturally oriented materials to accelerate the learning  process.  The ENL teacher uses guided reading strategies, a variety of texts and web based resources to enhance social and  academic language acquisition. Instructional materials as well as, instruction, supports all modalities of language acquisition.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered through cultural exchange and demonstration.  Additionally, native languages are  supported through bilingual books in class library and when text to speech is utilized in guided reading native language can be  accessed to strengthen comprehension of text.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Upon enrollment, English language learners are placed in grade appropriate classrooms according to their age.  Required  services and resources support English language learners due to their correlation with required grade level content  material.   Students are also given the opportunity to sign up for clubs and enrichment programs.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    English language learners are supported through the use of regular computer usage, use of computer lab, smart boards and  media.  Classrooms contain books on tape, leveled readers and culturally oriented materials to accelerate the learning  process.  The ENL teacher uses a variety of texts and web based resources to enhance social and academic language  acquisition. Instructional materials as well as, instruction, supports all modalities of language acquisition.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Registration closes upon the last day of the school year.  Registration resumes upon the first day of school in September.  Upon  registration, the newly enrolled English language learner is tested and placed in an age/grade appropriate classroom.  A peer  buddy is sought in order to assist the new student with becoming acclimated to the culture and guidelines of the school.  The  peer buddy is someone who is either on grade level, or close to grade level of the newly enrolled student.  The procedure  remains the same throughout the school year should new ELLs enroll. Families are also buddied for support in engaging  parents.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language elective offered to ELLs and native speakers in grades 5-8 is Spanish as a foreign language.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   There are no dual language programs in this school.           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)

Professional development for teachers of ELLs in order to support ELLs engaged in the common core learning standards are  offered through the Department of English Language Learner .       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers monitor progress of ELL students and provide academic support necessary to help  students better transition from elementary into middle and/or middle into high school.  In addition, the guidance counselor  regularly schedules meetings with students who are in transition in order to provide information as well as, emotional support.  ENL students will also participate in College Access for all program.  ENL Teacher professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 will be fulfilled through the Office of English  Language Learners professional development opportunities.  50% of total professional development hours for ENL Teacher will  be ELL specific.  In addition, 15% of total professional development hours for all teachers will be ELL specific and fulfilled  through lunch & learn,  weekly PD periods  and through the Office of English Language Learners as appropriate.  Records for  professional development activities will be kept through accumulating agendas and attendance sheets.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    Time is built into the weekly schedule (one day per week) for parents of ELLs and teachers of ELLs to discuss individual student  goals, language development progress, assessment results and concerns.  Parents are welcomed to reach out to classroom  and/or ENL teacher for feedback.  Should interpretation and translation be needed, bilingual staff is available for  interpretation.  In addition the Translation and Interpretation Unit is available for interpretation services via telephone.  Teachers will also contact parents every Tuesday to discuss their progress and needs.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our Parent Coordinator is in constant communication with all parents.  Through outreach and feedback the Parent Coordinator  schedules workshops specifically designed for families of English Language Learners.  Workshops include but are not limited to:  health issues, fair housing, tenant's rights, conflict resolution and domestic violence.  Additionally, the Parent Coordinator  organizes workshops regarding nutrition courses, technology, parenting classes, updated materials focused on the various  school curricula and articulation to middle school.  Parents of ELL students receive school related materials in English and in  the native language of the family.  Our technology teacher will provide workshops for parents of ENL students on how to  support their children with IXL and Achieve 3000.               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carlen Padmore-Gateau, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When a child is registered, parents are interviewed by our ENL teacher and administered the Home Language  Identification Survey, and if the need is present, he or she will speak with one of our staff members proficient in  their native language. Once parents indicate their language preference, the information is entered into ATS  system and then stored in the student's cumulative records. At the beginning of the school year, an ATS report is  printed to make an assessment of the different languages for which we need to provide information for parents.  The list is then placed in the office in order for it to be checked when information needs to be sent home to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      parents. This information helps us to determine the number of parents that need to receive written and oral  communication in Haitian Creole, Spanish, Arabic, French or other languages. If needed, we utilize the DOE  Interpretation Unit to assist in translation, via a conference call, for language interpretation that is not available at  the school. A review of data continues to indicate that small percentage of parents, primarily recent immigrants  from Haiti, Yemen, and Spanish speaking countries, presented a need for translators in their native language.  Based on the above and the evidenced need exhibited during our initial registration period in September, we  conclude that there is an on-going need to provide written translation services for our Arabic and Spanish  speaking populations. In recent years, we have experienced an increased need for Arabic translators. We have  been able to meet this need through the use of a paraprofessional who is available to translate for us during  registration and parent meetings. We will, as warranted, use the DOE translation unit. Report cards, including the  new STARS reports, are also available to parents in their native language. Finally, our school uses the language  identification guide for school staff.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
