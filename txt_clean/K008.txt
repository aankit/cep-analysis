This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 8, The Robert Fulton School: The Magnet School for Exploration, Research and Design, has a rich 150+ year history.  Currently, the school is a K-8 school split between two locations: the lower school (grades K-5) located at 37 Hicks  Street in Brooklyn Heights, and the middle school (grades 6-8) located at Westinghouse High School on Johnson Street  in downtown Brooklyn (a ten minute walk from the Hicks Street site). The advantage to the dual location model is that  the school can provide a cohesive educational experience based on a singular vision of quality education, while being  responsive to students’ developmental needs as they develop from elementary school to middle school.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Mission    PS 8 is a learning community dedicated to creativity, academic excellence and intellectual curiosity, with the aim of  developing life-long learners and engaged citizens. We are committed to the intellectual, artistic, emotional, moral,  social and physical development of each child.   Core Values    ● Our Community is Child-Centered   We strive to ensure that all decisions put the interests of children first.   ● Our Community Embraces Diversity and Individuality   We value diversity of culture, experience, and perspective.   ● Our Community is Inclusive   Believing that all people bring unique abilities and talents, we work to ensure that all members – including students,  staff and families – feel a sense of belonging and find ways to participate in our community.   ● Our Community Prepares Students for Citizenship   We strive to develop students’ understanding of the responsibilities of citizenship – both in and out of school, and  work to give them the skills they need to become active members in a democratic society.   ● Our Community Works as an Effective Team   Staff, families and the larger community collaborate to achieve our mission.   ● Our Community Takes Responsibility    We search for answers, make no excuses, and ask the hard questions.   ● Our Community Acts with Integrity and Respect    Ethical and honest behavior is part of everything we do. We believe how we achieve results is as important as the  results we achieve.   ● Our Community Strives for Excellence    We seek continuous improvement through reflection, innovation and thoughtful risk-taking.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Academics are highly valued as part of students’ preparation as they develop into active citizens in our local, national  and global communities. The core curriculum in the lower and middle school, taught primarily by the classroom  teachers, includes English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science. In addition to the core curriculum  our middle school students receive instruction in Foreign Language, Spanish. Beginning in Grade 5 students have  advisory periods, led by grade level teachers as well as out of classroom staff such as, but not limited to instructional  coaches and specialty teachers. The advisory program provides students with an opportunity to build a close  relationship with a caring adult in the school within a small group setting. Advisories work toward building a sense of  community as well as provide additional social and emotional support for students. On the middle school level they  learn to navigate social challenges and develop study skills, organizational skills and time management skills as they  travel between many classes. On Grade 5 we departmentalize and students travel between Humanities and STEM for  instruction. Across the grades, students have physical education and visual arts.    With a belief that all children are more likely to thrive when exposed to a rich and varied curriculum, the school offers  a variety of enrichment activities on top of the rigorous academic curriculum. In addition to having art, drama, library,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      music, dance and physical education as regular classes in the lower school, the school offers enrichment activities  during the school day in chess, physical education, visual arts, dance, music, yoga, and dramatic arts. Enrichment  partners for the 2018-2019 school year include: STUDIO in a school, Guggenheim Museum, Marquis Studio, New York  City Chess Inc, and Brooklyn Music School.    Caring for our planet is a focus in both the lower and middle school and takes many forms as it further enriches the  curriculum and empowers our students to become responsible citizens. The lower school, with support from Grow To  Learn and Teachers College, Columbia University, expanded its gardening program in 2014 to enrich the curriculum.  Students have also implemented a recycling and composting project. In 2017 the Garden Committee, with grant  funding created a beautiful garden in the previously unused front yard. This space includes an outdoor classroom that  may be used by students throughout the day for science work as well as outdoor writing time.    Over the course of the school year, middle school students partake in two two-week long interdisciplinary, in-depth  explorations that engage students in using their creativity, the resources of New York City, and their community to  understand and solve our planet’s most pressing problems, through the Exploration Program.   One strength of our school is our approach to teaching and learning as we work to develop the whole child. We  believe that the intellectual, artistic, emotional, moral, social and physical development of each child are all important  as we strive to develop life-long learners and engaged citizens. During the 2017-2018 school year one focus was on  better meeting the needs of students with disabilities as we worked to further develop our Integrated Co-Teaching  (ICT) program. All teachers in our ICT classrooms received professional development throughout the year in order to  learn and grow best practices for co-teaching in order to meet the needs of their students across the content areas.  This resulted in one ICT teaching team developing a lab site, and opening their doors to share best practices with our  community and the greater district community. This work will continue in the 2018-2019 school as we will further  develop our ICT Lab Site and support a new team as they participate in a year-long professional learning series to  deepen their professional partnership and to hone their craft.    We see the success of programs such as our recycling program, Project Citizen, the Solving the Problems of Our Planet  Program in the lower school and Explorations in the middle school as examples of how we are providing opportunities  for students’ full development through rewarding project based learning opportunities.    Family and Community engagement is a priority at PS 8. Strengthening a strong home-school connection through  open communication is a continued focus as we believe that a strong home-school connection is critical to success. In  recent years, communication has been improved through use of our school website, weekly email updates, monthly  Principals' Updates at PTA meetings, and tri-annual grade level meetings with administrators. The rate of participation  at Curriculum Night and parent-teacher conferences is high. In Spring 2018 at the lower school, teachers held grade  meetings for incoming families so that the families of students were able to get a sneak peak at the next grade prior  to the summer break. Curriculum overviews were presented by grade level teams and these previews were highly  successful. The active PTA and SLT support the school’s administration and teachers in their efforts to provide a high- quality, enriched education for students. Family members participate in a variety of activities from attending events in  the classroom to taking a leadership role in the school through active engagement on committees such as School  Wellness, Equity & Diversity and Gardening. Family engagement has led to community support for the school in  various ways, including political and financial support.    While there are advantages to having our middle school age students experiencing school in a different location,  having two school sites presents a challenge. One challenge is to engage adults in collaborative work across the two  sites. Some school personnel are required to travel between the sites during the school day, but the majority remain  in their own locations, isolated from those in the other location. Another challenge is the need to have duplicate  committees, the Safety Team, Professional Learning Team, School Wellness Council, etc, as the needs of the lower  and middle school vary. The PTA and SLT continue to make concerted efforts to engage parents from both locations at  school-wide events as well as lower and middle school specific events. The administration, SLT and PTA in  collaboration with district planning and the Community Superintendent submitted a plan to truncate the school and  establish the middle school as a "new school" beginning in September 2019. This will allow both schools to establish   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      cohesive communities with the ability to focus on the mission and core values directly connected to the student body  and their developmental needs.    Teacher collaboration is an important factor in the development of both rich and rigorous instruction and a  supportive learning environment. The approach to curriculum planning exemplifies the kinds of collaboration teachers  continuously engage in. We believe this is one of our strengths. In the lower school, teachers plan in weekly grade  level teams and also meet several times throughout the year in subject-specific “vertical teams” composed of a  representative from each grade. Planning is similar in the middle school in that grade level planning as well as subject- specific planning approaches are taken. This allows teachers to coordinate on shared curriculum while understanding  the context in which it is placed in the students’ overall trajectory through the overall school experience. This  approach to planning allows teachers to consider and be responsive to students’ specific academic, social and  emotional needs while maintaining a standards-based curriculum. In 2015-2016, we began a concerted effort to  bridge the divide between the lower and middle schools by having teachers visit colleagues between sites, with the  hope of strengthening vertical planning between the lower and middle school. In June 2017 we held a full-day of  professional learning with the lower and middle school staff. Last year, and again this year grade 5 - 8 math teachers  will participate in the citywide Algebra for All (A4A) initiative, another initiative which strengthens math instruction at  both sites.    Similarly, effective school leadership, with a focus on staff development to support student learning was evident  throughout the school year. Efforts were made to ensure that teachers had scheduled time for planning as well as  professional development. Faculty were given opportunities to participate in conferences, and take advantage of  opportunities for professional growth. Five members of the vertical math team attended the National Council of  Teachers of Mathematics in Washington, DC in May 2018.    Our strong family-community ties provide a wealth of resources for the school. Family and community members act  tirelessly to ensure that the school budget is supplemented so that as a school, we can provide the programs we feel  are necessary to meet the varied needs of our diverse student body. In addition to monetary contributions, family  members volunteer in many ways, organized by an active PTA with the support of our Parent Coordinator.    EXPLORATION- Middle School   The purpose of the Exploration units is to deeply engage students in learning in an authentic manner. Our ultimate  goal is to inspire and prepare students to solve our world’s problems. Exploration introduces MS8 students to the  practice of working and thinking outside the classroom and critically engaging with NYC as a source of knowledge and  inspiration. Students engage in a deep, two-week study of one issue, concept, or topic twice during the year. Students  read, talk to experts in the field, interact with the community, and visit many cultural, historical, and educational  institutions in New York City. At the end of each Exploration unit, students, parents and community members come  together to share and celebrate the work.    Essential Questions we have studied in the past include,                 “Is Our Relationship to Animals Ethical?”   “Can We End Global Hunger?”   “Is Change Good for Downtown Brooklyn?”  “How Can I Enact Change Within the World?”  "Can Art Change the World?”  “What is Courage?”   CELEBRATIONS/COMMUNITY BUILDING   At our school we have different rituals and traditions that build community and celebrate milestones. On the 8th of  each month we celebrate our school and build school spirit in a variety of ways. One month it is "Crazy Hair Day,"  another is "Crazy 8 Day," where children and adults creatively include 8's in their outfits, another is Pajama Day.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Another example of this is ‘Celebr8 Reading’, a month long event that builds the love of reading and community.  ‘Celebr8 Science’ is held at the middle school and students across the grades exhibit their science projects and have  fun. There are other events such as seasonal dances, our annual street fair the Paddle Wheeler and the Grade 5 and 8  end of year dances.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 8 serves a diverse population of students. In all grades there are students with varied learning styles and needs.  There is at least one ICT class on every grade level. Midway through the 2014-2015 school year, the middle school  welcomed students with autism as it opened a program in collaboration with District 75. Though serving a population  with a diversity of learning needs may seem a challenge at times, we believe that doing so enriches the lives of all  students.    The school has a diverse community that is appreciated by most. However, it came to light during the 2014-2015  school year that not all students felt equally emotionally secure, and that as a community we may not be doing all  that we can to meet the needs of all students in creating the supportive learning environment we aim to. Included in  this group are students of color and students with non-traditional family structures.    During the 2017-18 school year we partnered with Border Crossers and held two opportunities for community  members to begin working together to explore patterns of racism and injustice. A three-hour introductory workshop  was held for families one evening in the spring. A full day professional workshop was held for all staff members in  June. This work, led by the Equity & Diversity Committee, a sub-committee of our SLT will continue during the 2018- 19 school year. The full faculty will attend two 1/2 day follow-up trainings led by Border Crossers in November and  January this year. The Equity & Diversity Committee hosted a Diversity Potluck in the Fall and is planning additional  events for this school year. The lower school librarian is working with teachers to further diversify our book collection,  ensuring that our collection is inclusive.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools is an important tool that we use as a school community to guide our work towards  continuous improvement. Rigorous instruction, outstanding teachers and focused professional learning that allows all  adults to grow as learners is the cornerstone of our work as a learning community. Teachers hold high expectations  for all students and provide instruction that actively engages students through multiple means so that content is  accessible to all students. This was evident in the teaching and learning observed in classrooms as well as in student  work products. We exceeded our target in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide in Rigorous Instruction, ranked Well  Developed in indicators 1.1 and 2.2. 99% of teachers responded positively to the shift that has taken place in math  instruction and 95% responded positively to the shift that has taken place in Literacy instruction.    We believe the collaboration between administrators, teachers, other staff and families demonstrates the  establishment of trust and our common goal to create a supportive learning environment for all -- children and adults.  When it became evident that not all students were as comfortable in the learning environment as others, the SLT  established an Equity & Diversity Committee to build consciousness and positively recognize the diversity within our  school. That staff and families could come together to address challenges related to diversity is a further example of  the trust we all have in each other. Diversity became a key area of focus for the SLT in the 2015-2016 school year as  we engaged the whole school in activities and dialogue in hopes of creating a more supportive environment. During  the 2016-17 school our focus was on strengthening the connections between the lower and middle school sites. In  2017-18 we focused on building strong committees to address diversity and wellness. Members of the SLT took on  this task and parents and teachers worked together to establish strong Equity & Diversity and School Wellness sub- committees of the SLT. Each sub-committee consisted of parents and teachers representing both the lower and  middle schools. Meetings were held at both sites, sometimes as full committees, sometimes as smaller committees  representing just the lower or middle school, depending on the need at the time. This work resulted in our school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      receiving the distinction, NYC DOE Wellness Council of the Year in Spring 2018. Together, with support from the NYC  DOE Wellness Team and a sexual education consultant we developed a health program for students in grades 5 - 8.    Professional Learning is important. In addition to Monday professional learning our teachers meet weekly as grade  level teams with the support of our instructional coaches and administrators.

In 2016-2017 this program expanded and all 8th grade students were enrolled in  Algebra I and Living Environment, culminating in the regents exams in those areas. These offerings continue for all  students with support for math teachers and administrators throughout the year through the citywide Algebra for All  initiative and professional learning in science through Urban Advantage. In 2018-2019 three of our teachers are Math  for America (MfA) fellows, receiving additional exemplary professional learning as part of this exclusive community of  educators.    There is a continued focus to strengthen STEM opportunities and a need to ensure equitable opportunities across the  grades.

Below, each data source is briefly described and strengths and weakness revealed by the data are  identified.   NYSED School Report Card   Data from the ELA and math state tests for students from grades 3 through 8. The report card reveals the percentage  of students in various student populations who received a score deemed “proficient”, scoring a 3 or 4 on the state  tests. The data from the NYSED School Report Card revealed both strengths and weaknesses in student performance  on the 2016 and 2017 state tests in ELA and math.   According to the 2018 data from NYSED, PS 8 students achieved higher levels of proficiency in ELA and math than the  averages for New York City schools and District 13 schools in both ELA and math.

While the Quality Review  revealed many strengths in academic rigor, it also noted one area PS/ MS 8 should work to improve, pedagogy.   1. Strengths: PS/ MS 8 was found to be “Well Developed” in most areas, including School Culture of High  Expectations, Instructional Core Curriculum, Assessments, Teacher Teams and Leadership Development. “Well  Developed” is the highest rating possible. PS/ MS 8 was found to be “Well Developed” in “Ensur(ing) engaging,  rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to Common Core  Learning Standards and/or content standards.”    2. Weakness: The quality reviewers deemed PS/ MS 8 “Proficient” in Pedagogy and noted that, “teaching practices are  aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs about how students learn best. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into the curricula the opportunity to provide high quality extensions was not observed  as a common teacher practice.”    In the 2018-2019 school year, we will improve overall academic instruction to provide high quality extensions for our  proficient learners.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Overall, the school provides a rich curriculum and many opportunities for learning. Student performance is high,  suggesting a supportive learning environment. However, our needs assessment revealed that for some students the  school needs to work harder in providing a supportive environment in which they feel emotionally secure and ready  for learning. This includes students of color throughout the grades. While the focus is creating a supportive  environment, we understand that in doing so, we will have to establish trust between students, staff and families, and  we will need to create strong family and community ties, thus this framework element is closely linked to other  framework elements. The following are evidence that highlights both the school’s strengths and suggests the need for  such work:   We exceeded our target in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide in Collaborative Teachers, ranked Well Developed in  indicators 4.1 and 4.2.    Quality Review 2013-2014:   o “Across classrooms, common instructional practices such as student groups, mini lessons, choice options,  instructional charts, monitoring student behavior, and teachers conferring with students, result in the engagement of  all learners, including English language learners and students with disabilities, in challenging tasks…. The incorporation  of these key instructional strategies has provided multiple opportunities for students to access learning in different  ways, with scaffolds and other instructional supports that allow them to construct meaning and deepen their thinking,  as evidenced by the exemplary student work viewed in classrooms.”   School Quality Guide 2014-2015:    Student Demographic Information:      % English Language Learners - - 3%     % Students with IEPs - - 15%     % Students with IEPs (less than 20% time with non-disabled peers) - - 0%     % Free Lunch Eligible - - 12%     % HRA Eligible -- 10%    % Temporary Housing -- 2%    % Asian - - 6%     % Black - - 15%     % Hispanic - - 11%     % White - - 60%     % Other - - 7%   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      Student Achievement – “Meeting Target”      School Survey 2014-2015:       Supportive Environment was the only category that was below the citywide % positive response for  elementary/ middle schools  Increase from 65% to 87% students reporting that they feel safe in the hallways, bathrooms and cafeterias.        Teachers and Parents had an overall favorable assessment of the school environment.

It  should be noted that only middle school students (grades 6 and 7 in 2013-2014) were surveyed, while  students in grades K-5 were not surveyed. Other indicators of school environment were rated more favorably  by students.    Principal’s Report to SLT 11/06/2014:    o Paraphrased: Some students of color in the upper elementary grades met with the principal and expressed that they  do not always feel that they belong.

Teachers will use common planning to plan curriculum focused on diversity and classroom instruction time to  implement the curriculum. Since common planning time and instructional time are already scheduled for teachers, an  adjustment in schedule is not anticipated at this time. Parents will volunteer time to achieve this goal in various ways,  including but not limited to working with family buddies, planning and holding events, and volunteering on  committees.

We exceeded our target in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide in Collaborative Teachers, ranked Well Developed in  indicators 4.1 and 4.2.    An assessment of the academic program and school practices suggests that while Collaborative Teachers is a strength,  there is room for growth in terms of how teachers collaborate for the purpose of improved instruction and student  outcomes.    ● Quality Review 2015-2016 (most recent QR Data)   o The vast majority of teachers are engaged in inquiry-based, structured professional collaborations that have  strengthened teacher instructional capacity and promoted the implementation of Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers systematically analyze key elements of teacher work and assessment data, and student work for students  they share.    o Support and evaluation of teachers is provided through feedback using the Danielson framework and analysis of  learning outcomes.    During the 2017-18 school year intervisitations were held regularly and teachers provided feedback to one another  via email after visits. During the 2018-19 school year intervisitations are further encouraged through in-house  showcases of teaching and learning. In October Grade 4 teachers showcased student talk, inviting colleagues in to  observe use of a teacher created Talk Rubric during whole class, small group and independent work across content  areas.

On a daily basis there are parent volunteers in our library, in our cafeteria assisting with lunch and recess  and supporting schoolwide events such as the annual Book Fair, Read-a-thon and field trips.    The subcommittees of our SLT, the Equity & Diversity and the School Wellness committees have solid representation  of parents and teachers.   Teachers attest to having close ties with families, working as partners to ensure academic and social/emotional  success.   In most measures of parent and family engagement in the 2017-18 School Survey, PS 8 rated highly. 90% of parents  favorably responded to questions regarding teacher outreach to parents, while 96% of teachers felt that teacher  outreach to parents was favorable. 94% of parents felt involved with PS 8.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K008, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 8 will support parents and families by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents. This  information will be maintained by the School Leadership Team.       In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association and parent  members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the  Parent-Teacher Association. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development,  especially in developing leadership skills when necessary;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: understanding child and adolescent development, grade- level curriculum, and assessment expectations; and training to build parents’ capacity to support their children’s  appropriate use of technology at home; helping students to appreciate the diversity of the community;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., grade level meetings with the principal, to share information about the  school’s educational program and other initiatives of the school and Chancellor, and to allow parents to provide  suggestions, ask questions and express concerns;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year  beginning with Curriculum Night in September and culminating with a preview of the upcoming year in May    ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on the School Leadership Team, sub-committees and/or Parent- Teacher Association;   ● supporting and hosting family events including, but not limited to, Potlucks, Paddlewheeler, and District Family Day;   ● maintaining a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are distributed to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress at the middle school via Skedula/PupilPath;   ● maintaining a school website designed to keep parents informed about school activities;         School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   13K008, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to assess the early literacy needs of ELL students, our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell book leveling systems and  word lists. Teachers also use Words Their Way to evaluate the student’s spelling stage and determine the phonics work that  needs to be done with each child. Kindergarten teachers use a concepts of print and letter/sound identification assessments.  This is also given to struggling readers in first and second as well as beginner ELLs, as needed. FUNdations also has unit  assessments to see how well kids are learning concepts and that is used in grades K-2. All grades do writing on demand in  narrative, persuasive and informational writing. This data helps the ENL teacher to better understand where the ELL students  fall in terms of the other monolingual classmates and examine the student’s phonics and literacy and language needs.  Information is shared between the classroom and the ENL teacher on an on-going basis. The information can help us to better  understand the strengths and weaknesses of our ELL students and to set up educational plans for them.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The classroom teachers and ENL teacher work together to ensure that all ELL students receive the necessary assessments,  both formative and curriculum-embedded ones. Sometimes the ENL teacher may help with a running record or do the Words  Their Way assessments. They will then meet on their preps or after school professional time to discuss the results and further  support their planning. Both the ENL and classroom teachers will also do on-demand writing assessments for each unit of  study and then discuss the results. The results are then used to guide instruction. Writing rubrics are also given out to students  as a way to help students self-assess and teachers to see where the students see themselves in terms of their needs and  development.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school evaluates the success of our program for ELLs based on performance on the NYSESLAT and other state exams, as  well as, on the progress we see the ELL students make in their classroom and with the ENL teacher. We hope to see ELL  students make progress by at least one proficiency level on the NYSESLAT and make progress on ELA and Math exams, where  applicable. We also look at Fountas and Pinnell running records for reading level improvement and writing samples, as well as,  sight word and spelling assessments. Additionally, all students do an on-demand writing sample in the beginning of the year  and write continually with the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher also monitors the writing development of the ELLs through the  weekly use of a dialogue journal and in class writing assignments and presentations. She also works collaboratively with the  classroom teacher and assesses and discusses the written work done in the classroom, as well as the child's reading ability and  habits, listening and speaking skills, and general mannerisms and presentation in class in terms of language development and  usage. Teachers look back to see where the child was at the beginning of the year, and trace the child's  development  throughout the year to the end. The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL gives us a way of tracking progress in all four stages  of language development. We also incorporate feedback from classroom and content area teachers, as well as the student  report cards. Students also complete their own self-assessments throughout the year and meet with and discuss their  strengths and weaknesses with the ENL teacher. The students themselves are given feedback on a regular basis so that they  can improve and understand their language development. Success is determined by a holistic view of the child and his or her  language development, progress, and usage.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are many structures in place to address interventions once the summative date has been gathered. Classroom teachers  and the ENL teacher meet to discuss the students' progress and then plan instruction accordingly. If there is a need for  additional intervention, they will request a PPC meeting with school staff, such as literacy intervention teacher and  SETSS/Special Education Liasion to plan for supports that can be first used in the classroom and then if necessary students will  also receive academic intervention services to further support the students' learning. Teachers and staff will then set a time to  meet again to further discuss progress and plan for additional intervention strategies to support the student in the classroom  and/or small groups. Classroom groupings are modified if needed to meet the needs of students. Teachers then share any  findings with parents during the Tuesday parent-engagement time or at another agreed upon time.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data to guide instruction with the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework for grades K-8. It uses high  quality, evidence-based instruction for all students, including ELLs at the Tier I, II, and III intervention levels, and incorporates  language development to move ELLs to where they need to be. The process begins with a universal screening process that is  adminIstered to all students. For ELLs, these means their parents are given a Home Language Survey to complete upon  enrollment and an informal interview of both the child and the parents are given by a certified pedagogue. If another language  is spoken and the child’s English is limited, the child is given the NYSITELL as an initial assessment. This helps teachers to  uncover any factors that could influence the student’s English language learning process and allows teachers to make  linguistically responsive instructional choices. Beyond screening and identification for ENL services to support language  development, ELL students also take part in RtI screening to access whether his/her literacy skills and competencies are  meeting grade level benchmarks. If an ELL student is flagged as at-risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53   competency, the student will receive targeted instructional support to bolster development in this area. This support is then  delivered in coordination with language support services.  Additionally, periodic assessments and data are recorded for students in the RtI framework. This continual look at data allows  teachers, both classroom and ENL teachers, to work together to design targeted instruction for the ELL students. When  progress is monitored, the expected rate of an ELL’s progress takes into account language development and background. The  student’s progress is then compared with levels demonstrated by peers from comparable cultural, linguistic, and experiential  backgrounds who have received the same or comparable intervention. Teachers and school leaders can use data to determine  when it is necessary to adjust instruction for all ELLs.  Knowledge of typical second language development and the student’s  history of first and second language (e.g. educational background) is considered when setting benchmarks.    We use the Response to Intervention (RTI) framework to provide systematic work with all students in a classroom and provide  an escalating process of interventions over a prescribed interval of time to determine if students are responding to the  assistance they receive. The RTI team plans and coordinates RTI throughout the school and helps to track and monitor student  progress. The ELL teachers works with this team, as well, when needed for her students. At first, students are offered TIer I  interventions in the classroom as the classroom teacher differentiates their lessons and customizes instruction for their  students' needs. Progress is monitored through running records, spelling inventories, on demand writing samples, and other  phonics and sight word assessments. Depending on how a student is progressing based on the data, students will continue  with Tier I interventions or be moved to a Tier II intervention that matches their needs. Students who are still lagging behind  with Tier II level instruction will then receive Tier III support by being pulled from their classroom and working with the  intervention teacher. If after several weeks of Tier III intervention and little to no improvement, the students may then be  referred to the School Assessment team for further evaluation.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use outcome assessments from the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math date to evaluate and inform our programs. The  data patterns across performance levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT indicate that many students test out of the NYSESLAT  in second grade. We have the majority of our ELL's in the kindergarten and first and second grades. We have seven  kindergarten ELLs at a range of levels ranging from Emerging, Transitioning, to Expanding. We have seven first graders who are  mostly at the transitioning or expanding level. One first grader when from the entering to the emerging level. Our seven  second graders are all at the expanding level, except for two. Of these two, one student went from entering to emerging and  has an IEP. The other of these two went from Emerging to Commanding after being in the program for only a year and just  coming to the country. Of the six third grade ELLs in our program, all but two are at the commanding level. One student has an  IEP and is at the transitioning level and the other student is at the expanding level and this is his second year in the country.  We have no 4th grade ELL students and only five fifth grade ELLs. Of these five 5th graders, three are at the commanding level  and the other two who are not are at the expanding level and also have IEPs. Therefore, it shows that according to our data,  the majority of ELL students in the program our elementary school make progress and then test out in the second grade.    The data and program population is more varied at the middle school, grades 6-8. In sixth grade, we have one student with an  IEP who has been in the program since she first arrived in second grade. She is at the expanding level. There is another  newcomer ELL in the sixth grade who is at the entering level. In seventh grade, we have one student who arrived in the middle  of third grade who is now at the commanding level and another student this year who just arrived and is at the entering level.  In 8th grade, we have one student at the commanding level and another who arrived this year at the expanding level. The data  varies greatly.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher shares the results of these findings in a meeting and on paper with the classroom teachers of the ELL students  and then both teacher's plan their lessons according to the student's current levels, needs, and goals              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELL instruction is delivered to ELLs in the freestanding ENL program as per CR Part 154.2. Students are grouped  according to their language proficiency and grade levels. Some language proficiency levels are mixed, as are grades,  depending upon the needs and make up of the students. Instruction is delivered by a dually certified ENL and  Common Branch teacher. This teacher works closely with the classroom teachers to ensure that the needs of the  children are being met accordingly. The ENL teacher also delivers standalone ENL to support the language needs of  the students. This grouping is done according to their language proficiency levels and grades.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable. We do not have any TBE programs.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable. We do not have any DL programs.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes are delivered in each program model. All entering ELL students receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction, including 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction. All  emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction, including 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated  ENL in ELA, and another 90 minutes that is either standalone or integrated. Transitioning ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL  instruction, including 90 minutes of integrated ENL in content areas and another 90 minutes that is either standlone or  integrated depending upon the students' individual needs. Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  instruction. All former ELL’s for up to two years receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in ELA or Content Areas.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our school ensures that core content is delivered in each program model. In the Freestanding ENL program (which is all our  school currently has), ELL students are given personal word walls, glossaries, picture dictionaries, word-for-word dictionaries in  English and their home language, and vocabulary lists. In addition, language is scaffolded for them in read alouds and class  presentations and lessons. Bridging is used to connect the ELL students’ content area knowledge with new vocabulary and  promote language development. Teachers also use technology, such as smartboards and computers to help build ELL students’  language skills through vocabulary, phonics, and reading comprehension games and read alouds. Charts and other visual aids  also help promote the students’ second language development. Teachers use alphabet, sight words, and picture cue cards to  develop the second language. Teachers also try to group or pair ELL students with English proficient students to serve as a  language model for the ELL student. Materials include leveled books, personal word walls, alphabet charts, reader's and  writer's notebooks, visual charts on the walls, and a number of different language games, including phonics and reading  comprehension games and other useful bookmarks to assist the students in reading. Maps and other visual aids are also used  to illustrate core content area learning. Bilingual books and bilingual dictionaries are also used to support the student's  language and content area acquisition and learning.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55       Our school ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year. Students are  encouraged to read in their home language and then write about it in English, or where available, write in their home language  and then use google translate to translate to English.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for all ELL sub-groups:     a. P.S. 8 does not have any SIFE students at our school. However, the plan for SIFEs is to include them in the appropriate grade  level classroom and provide them with the extra intervention services with the math intervention and ELA intervention  teachers where needed.  SIFEs will also work with the ENL and intervention teachers during the school day. These teachers will  work closely with the classroom teachers to ensure that the student is making progress. Instruction will be differentiated by all  teachers who work with the SIFEs and communication will be maintained on a regular basis between all teachers and parents,  as well, so that the student is brought up to grade level.     b. Newcomers (ELLs in U.S. schools less than three years): All newcomers receive the appropriate amount of ENL instruction as  mandated per CR-Part 154. Because No Child Left Behind (NCLB) now requires testing for all identified ELL’s in the country for  more than one year, these students are given extra support in preparing for the State exams. They are given support with  focused instruction on developing their language skills and understanding the language and strategies needed to be successful  on the State exams. Additionally, they are given support with the math or reading intervention teachers as needed. They are  also given word walls and picture dictionaries to help build and expand their vocabulary as well as access to the online reading  program--Raz-Kids, which helps expand their vocabulary and build their reading skills and letter-sound-identification skills.  They can also listen to books on tape in the content areas to help build their background knowledge. Brainpop is another  resource used for newcomers. The ENL teacher works with the classroom teacher to find ways to make the content area  accessible to these ELLs.     c.  ELL’s receiving service for 4-6 years receive the mandated amount of ENL instruction. Classroom teachers differentiate  instruction for the students and are made aware of their language needs. The ENL teacher also differentiates instruction and  works closely together with the classroom teachers to move these ELLs along. All teachers share information about the needs  and progress of the children and work together to support the students in a continuous manner. These ELLs take the NYSESLAT  and other standardized tests, such as the predictives, ELA, and Math exams throughout the year. All test scores are analyzed  and discussed by teachers working with the student. This helps teachers to focus instruction and provide the student with the  appropriate language scaffolds to support their language acquisition and development. An RTI plan will be created for the child  based on his or her needs. If needed, the child will also receive counseling and other support. Parents are also encouraged to  come in and meet with the teachers to also assist in helping the 4-6 year ELL students make progress. Shared reading, read  alouds, books on tape, word walls, and online reading programs, such as Raz-Kids with comprehension and vocabulary  questions and levelled reading systems, also benefit these ELLs, as well. They also engage in guided reading groups based on  their level.     d.  For long-term ELLs (those who completed more than 6 years in the program), the same interventions and strategies  mentioned above are also used. They are given intervention support and the properly mandated ENL instruction, in which the  ENL teacher focuses on the specific language needs. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher and RTI team to  build on these language needs both in the classroom and in the ENL pull-out program. The RTI team will meet to discuss the  needs of these students and develop an academic plan. Teachers may also attend a PPC (Pupil Personnel Committee) meeting  with SETSS teacher, guidance counselor, principal, and other related service providers and classroom and ENL teachers to  discuss the needs of the students and come up with an RTI Plan for the students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      e. Former ELLs are closely monitered by the ENL teacher and current classroom teachers. They are given the mandated  number of ENL minutes (90 minutes) of integrated ENL services. The ENL teacher works with the classroom teacher to help the  former ELLs in their class with their specific needs. Support is given to the classroom teacher to help meet the needs of the  former ELLs. Academic intervention services may also be provided on an as needed basis to assist the former ELLs. Former ELLs  will also be given testing modifications on State exams for up to two years after they reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students are given personal word walls, glossaries, picture dictionaries, word-for-word dictionaries in English and their  home language, and vocabulary lists. In addition, language is scaffolded for them in read alouds and class presentations and  lessons. Bridging is used to connect the ELL students’ content area knowledge with new vocabulary and promote language  development. Teachers also use technology, such as smartboards and computers to help build ELL students’ language skills  through vocabulary, phonics, and reading comprehension games and read alouds. Charts and other visual aids also help  promote the students’ second language development. Teachers use alphabet, sight words, and picture cue cards to develop  the second language. Teachers also try to group or pair ELL students with English proficient students to serve as a language  model for the ELL student.  Students are given low-level, but high interest content area books to read to access the content  area instruction.    Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a number of different instructional strategies and grade-level materials to provide access to  academic content areas and accelerate English language development. Among these are visual charts and graphic organizers,  levelled libraries with a variety of non-fiction texts, content area taxonomies, and word walls differentiated for the appropriate  grade level for each child. The books the child reads is on his or her level and writing assignments are motified so that the ELL- SWD can meet the same content area standards as his or her native speaking, non-SWD peers. The same strategies and  protocol for long-term ELLs and ELLs 4-6 years are also used with ELL-SWDs. Meetings are held to discuss the children's  progress. Counseling is provided when necessary. Students are instructed at a pace that is appropriate for them. Programs,  such as, Wilson and Fundations, are also used to support these learners. Some ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT classrooms, while  others may receive SETSS during the school day. The SETSS teacher and ESL teacher discuss the progress of the child and work  with the classroom teacher. Collaboration occurs amongst all parties involved including the parents. The school ensures that  ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL instruction receive the appropriate program because all teachers and out-of-classroom  personnel that work with the child come together during IEP meetings to discuss the child's academic and social-emotional  needs to ensure that his or her placement is the best fit.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  P.S. 8 uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive  environment. ELL-SWDs are scheduled for ENL during a time that does not conflict with the child's needs in their classroom as  per their IEP. ELL and classroom teachers discuss curricular and instructional strategies to support the needs of the ELL-SWD.  Modifications are made to curriculum and instruction to ensure that ELL-SWDs have access to the material being taught and  are meeting his or her language goals and needs. The school ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize the time  the ELL-SWD spends with non-disabled peers, both in his or her classroom and in the ENL group.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school has both an math intervention teacher and a ELA intervention teacher who provides additional support to students  who need further intervention throughout the year. In addition, the ENL teacher utilizes the Raz-Kids reading program, which  differentiated according to reading levels and provides comprehension and vocabulary activities for the students in a range of  content areas. Teachers can also access Brainpop to make the material more accessible for students.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends, we will have an after school program for our ELLs to further support their language and academic  needs. The after school program will focus on preparing students for the NYSESLAT and helping them to access core material,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      especially nonfiction readings, building both vocabulary and comprehension. We have found that many of our students are  successful in the listening and speaking sections of the NYSESLAT, but need more help with their reading and writing skills. For  this reason, the after school program will focus on increasing student's writing and reading abilities.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not have a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs such as the YMCA and Kids Orbit and Kids Cre8 after school programs.  Information is sent home to parents in the children’s teacher correspondence folder. If needed, this material is translated for  the parent. The ENL teacher also reaches out to parents that need assistance in registering their children for these programs  and assists with the registration process. Teachers and staff utilize an interpreter via the Big Word or the Language Line when  needed and also send information home in the home language for parents that need it using the Language Translation and  Interpretation Unit.    YMCA and Kids Orbit program provide an number of enrichment activities for ELLs including homework help. Kids Cre8  includes programs like knitting, robotics, video games, arts and crafts, exercise, running, cooking, football, basketball, among  others.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  There are many instructional materials used to support English language learners. Raz-Kids Reading program is a  differentiated, leveled reading program that allows students to independently read on their levels and answer comprehension  and vocabulary questions after they have done their assigned non-fiction or fiction readings. Because the readings are on the  student's own level, it helps each ELL grow and their own pace and meet their own academic needs. The genres include fiction  to non-fiction and include a variety of topics, allowing students to access many content area knowledge in both social studies  and science. This helps to expand and grow their background knowledge..    The ENL teacher also utilizes various language and phonics software with the students. Students have access to numerous  websites for building language and phonics skills, such as Starfall, abcya, abcfastphonics, eslgamesworld, vocabulary.co.il,  breakingnesenglish.com, and Brainpop among others. Students also have access to levelled libraries, native language books,  and a school library with many types of books on various topics. Maps, diagrams, and charts are used to support content area  instruction. The ENL teacher also provides language games that students use to develop their language skills and interact with  other students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We only have an ENL program at our school. Home language support is delivered and assessed in this program. Word to word  dictionaries and glossaries are used as well as google translate and other bilingual dictionaries and resources. If the student  speaks Spanish, the Spanish LAB is given to assess the student's language ability in Spanish. When available, students are given  books in their home language. Each student is given a HLIS form, parent and student interview, and if the need is determined,  they will be given the NYSITELL which will determine their need for ELL support services.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our school ensures all required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. Where needed,  the school will order new materials for the students that is selected by the school’s ENL teacher and classroom teachers.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share a building.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELLs are invited in to tour the school and meet with the ENL teacher,  school guidance counselor, parent coordinator and assistant principal or principal.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered to ELLs in grades 6-8.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Teachers of ELL's regularly attend professional development that supports ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning  Standards. This PD is both done at the school level and offered by the DOE. If one teacher attends, he or she turnkeys it for the  rest of the school. These PD's include ELL scaffolds and strategies, looking closely at the Common Core standards and how they  apply to all students, including ELLs, and ways to support ELLs in meeting the standards. Rubrics are used and examined to help  guide the instruction and also provide clear guidelines for the students. Also teachers look at the academic language that is  necessary for ELL's to understand in order to meet these standards and also ways to develop their academic vocabulary  through read alouds, direct instruction, and group work and ways to develop their writing to meet the Common Core Learning  Standards    Teachers of ELLs attend PD on an ongoing basis during the school year. Every Monday afternoon there is professional  development at our school.

Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2. 15% of the total hours for all teachers and  50% of the total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Teachers have  access to PD through the DOE website and Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project. Additionally, our school has weekly  PD after school on Mondays.  Teachers keep records of the agendas of the professional development that they attend.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development,  language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This is done in the spring of  each year. The ENL teacher reaches out to the parents and classroom teachers of the students and sets up a meeting that is  convenient for all parties involved. Sometimes this takes places during the Tuesday parent-engagement time, but can be  scheduled at another time, as well. Letters are sent home to the parents about this meeting, or they are contacted via phone  or email. Translation in the parents' home langauge is provided if needed for the letters that go home informing the parents of  these meetings and an interpreter is present at these meetings if needed, as well.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parent involvement are our school is quite good. Some parents come in to their children’s classrooms to teach about and  share things from their culture on a regular basis. Most parents attend all parent-teacher conferences and any additional  meetings, including, but not limited to IEP meetings. Interpreters in the parent's preferred langauge is provided at these  meetings as needed. Parents also attend shows for their children, like drama, music, dance, and art performances and  publishing parties given monthly in their children’s classes. The parent coordinator also hosts a services of workshops for  parents in the evenings throughout the school year and teachers do, as well, including testing information meetings for  parents. The school's literacy coaches also hold workshops for parents, as well, that include topics such as testing and also  reading strategies and support. Translations services in the parents' home languages are made use for parents whose  preferred language is a language other than English so that they can be informed of these events and participate.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patricia Peterson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).

Parents also fill out a biographical card that includes what  language(s) they speak. Based on the answers to these questions as well as the parent’s verbal requests, the  school then provides parents with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand.       If the parent is new to the school but not new to the New York City Department of Education, the appropriate  administrators and pedagogues, including the school’s E.L.L. coordinator/teacher and LAC, will look at the child’s   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      HLIS to determine if a language other than English is requested for communication.
