This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Public School 214's Mission Statement:   Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to educate every child to his and her fullest potential. We provide a comprehensive, standards-driven  instructional program designed to address the varied learning styles and ability levels of our students. We strive to  build a strong collaborative relationship with parents and guardians as they have an integral part in our students  achieving standards of excellence.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         Public School 214’s School Vision Statement:    Every Child, Every Journey... At PS 214K we strive to provide rich, motivating learning experiences for every child. Our  goal is to establish environments which opens the doors to a life of learning. We are here to support our students,  their families and the community in your path to global citizenship in this 21st century.       Public School 214’s Instructional Focus for 2018-2019:    To engage all students in guided reading instruction, specifically strategies to develop and master word meanings,  which will expand their reading comprehension and increase literacy achievement school-wide.      Public School 214’s Equity Vision Statement for 2018-2019:       PS 214K is committed to the belief that all students are entitled to opportunities that will allow them to access all  learning and become successful. This equity commitment will be achieved by:     holding the school community accountable to high expectations for all student learning;    providing intentional experiences and resources for all students which will allow them to access both      academic and non-academic learning, and empower each to advocate for themselves;  confronting both racial and economic disparities by celebrating our diversity, breaking down cultural barriers  and building an appreciation for unique, diverse learners;     providing intensive, data-driven interventions and social-emotional supports for all students to face and deal   with challenges, and grow into successful global citizens.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 214K is located in City Line, a sub-section of East New York, Brooklyn, bordering Queens. As City Line is  one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Brooklyn, we celebrate the diversity of our student population,  which is largely Bengali and Hispanic. We have full classes on every grade, which includes full-day Pre-Kindergarten to  Grade 5. The school population comprises 13% Black, 33% Hispanic, 3% White, and 49% Asian students. The student  body includes 15% English language learners and 15% special education students. Boys account for 52% of the  students enrolled and girls account for 48%.   Due to our increase in immigrant populations and based on targeted needs evident for all of our students, especially  our English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities, we are striving to increase comprehension and language  proficiency across all grades. To meet these goals we are increasing our support staff for Response to Intervention  Services. In addition, increased professional development by our English as a Second Language providers, increased  leveled trade books in classroom libraries, use of the school library as a literacy center will help to support the  increase in reading and writing proficiencies. We continue our partnership with the Cypress Hills Development  Corporation for a new neighborhood Beacon Program which will offer after school and weekend programs, infusing  literacy support, for students and families within our community. This 2018-2019, we continue our partnerships with  the Lang Lang Foundation who supports us with our Piano music program in grades 2 to 5. Also, we are partnering  with Beat the Streets this year for a new wrestling program for both boys an girls, to help our students build  discipline, confidence and self-esteem. Throughout the year, we partner with the Brooklyn Public Library to ensure  our families are up to date with their cards and new offerings from the library for reading support. Through generous   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      grants from our local councilman, we are able to bring in arts residencies such as 'Inside Broadway' for grade 2 in  which are students become versed in Broadway music, dance and production.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As a school with approximately 15% of our student population with special needs, our goal is to provide targeted  support for all of our special needs students. The school-wide data for 2017-2018 reflect test scores in grades 3, 4, & 5  are at a low in both ELA and Math. To help our teachers in support our students we are providing ongoing  professional development for differentiation, autism, behavior management, Response to Intervention, and building  the capacity of our Early Childhood teachers on Wilson Fundations. With the help of a new Universal Literacy Coach  for grades Kindergarten to 2, the use of the response to intervention resources will help target literacy needs within  small groups. To meet the diverse needs of our special needs students, we are implementing innovative approaches  to providing individualized learning opportunities. We are designing a pilot program to include towards flexible  programming for identified students in grades 3, 4, and 5. Our newly formed School Implementation Team (SIT) along  with our Pupil Personal Team (PPT) reviews IEPs and supports teachers on improving the quality of the IEPs during  weekly and monthly meetings. In addition, the continuous reviews of the IEPs allow for the addition of parent voice.  Through the use of ongoing case management, we are tracking student progress to determine individual student's  needs and plan accordingly.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We will continue to provide ongoing support for Advance , the New York City Department of Education Teacher  Evaluation System, as well as, a constructive lens of Common Core Learning Standards for all staff. Several areas of  focus for 2018-2019 include the need to increase student engagement through practices of discussion and critical  thinking, the need to increase students’ reading stamina across grades Kindergarten to 5, the need to increase  students’ writing stamina across grades Kindergarten to 5, the need to share best practices for differentiation and  multiple entry points for all students, and implementation of a comprehensive progress monitoring system for all  students, which will include Response to Intervention, to track ongoing progress across core subjects.   For the 2018-2019 school year, we continue to celebrate our record as a school ‘In Good Standing’ as per the New  York State Report Card. This school year, we will continue to offer Professional Learning Opportunities designed by  our active professional learning communities, which provide teacher support on sharing best teaching practices for  differentiation, classroom environment, reflective planning, intervisitations, normed understandings of Danielson’s  Framework, and revisions of grade-wide curriculum maps and unit plans. In addition, we will continue to partner with  Brooklyn North, District 19 Professional Learning Opportunities, educational consultants and other agencies for job- embedded professional development. The success of our ongoing learning opportunities will be evident in our  students’ progress in the core subjects. Through reflective planning and teacher training, teachers are building their  practices to include interdisciplinary, hands-on experiences for students to engage them in more meaningful and  challenging learning. Several goals for our students include the use of a fully functional school library which will give  students and families opportunities to explore literacy and research, as well as, building a STEAM: Science,  Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math and program in PS 214K. Our acclaim is that our students graduate on to  many top middle schools in District’s 19 and 27.   We are excited that PS 214K will continue to expand on the school wide initiative, MTSS/PBIS. MTSS (Multi-tiered  School System) and PBIS (Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports) are school wide programs where students  and staff work together to create a positive, safe, and nurturing academic environment. Parent letters will be sent  home with descriptions about MTSS/PBIS and what it looks like in our school.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS214K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

As per the  LAB-R/NYTL/NYSESLAT 2018 data and June 2018 register, we have 122 English as a New  Language Learners. Our after school program will be designed for newcomer ENLs and SIFE  ENLs (students with interrupted formal education), as well as ELLs who are struggling readers  in grades 3 - 5.  3rd grade consists of 17 students (5 Entering, 2 Emerging, 3Transitioning, 7  Expanding levels), fourth grade consists of 15 ENL students (1 Entering, 1 Emerging, 3  Transitioning, 10 Expanding); fifth grade consists of 12 ENL students (2 Entering, 1 Emerging, 5  Transitioning, 4 Expanding). The differentiated, small group instruction and activities will  provide these students with phonics using the Wilson Reading System, methodologies learned  from Teachers College Workshop to support their reading, writing, and math skills using Go  Math that they may be lacking.  Our intention is to create a proactive support for students to  narrow their knowledge gap with their peers so that these students gain confidence and perform  better on the state wide ELA, Math and NYSESLAT exams. English will be the language of  instruction.  All After School programs will be facilitated by licensed ESL/ Bilingual teachers.  Three teachers will facilitate the after school program and three teachers will facilitate the  Saturday program.  Analysis of NYSESLAT (2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18) and the ELA NY State Exam data  (2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18), indicates that reading and writing are the lowest modalities  among our ENLs. Therefore, instructional focus and activities will be heavily concentrated on  developing their reading and writing skills. Additionally, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and  reading comprehension will be taught. Our goal is to foster the love of reading, while teaching  various reading skills to enhance students’ reading and comprehension and speaking. Curricula  will be organized around “big questions”, involve authentic reading and writing experiences, and  provide textual choices and meaningful content for students. Our program will also focus on  developing phonemic awareness especially for the students who are in Entering, Emerging and  Transitioning stages and reading comprehension and writing will be the focus for students in the  Expanding stages. The analysis of our 2017-18 Math State Test indicates that students are in  need of intensive intervention in Math. Therefore, math instruction will be added to support them  in math skills that students might be lacking in.We will use methodologies learned from  Teachers College Workshop to enhance literacy skills, as well as content-based materials to  ensure that students are exposed to rich academic language. The teachers will select complex  texts for read aloud during the mini lesson. Through deconstruction and reconstruction  of  complex texts, students will learn different literacy skills, such as grammar, vocabulary, main  idea, context clues, sequencing and characterization, as well as content area knowledge. In order  to support student’s comprehension, scaffolds will be used during all lessons. One of the most  important steps in critical reading is to make predictions about a piece of writing prior to the first  reading. For our entering and emergent readers, we will use a strategy called, 'taking a book  walk' where students make predictions prior to reading, which enhance their understanding of  what they will read.

As part of our Teachers' College  Workshop, students will need to be read independently, supported by several online reading  programs, as well as the provided leveled library. Students have been tested through running  records and they will have access to online reading programs. In addition, students will also  receive instruction to prepare them for the NYSESLAT assessment.  The two programs will be held after school on Wednesdays and Thursdays for two hours. These  programs will begin around November 2018 and will last approximately 20 weeks. It will begin  at 2:30pm and end at 4:30pm.  The number of After School sessions will be approximately 40  sessions depending on budget.   The After School program will consist of 3 groups. The students who will participate in the After  School program will be 3rd, 4th and 5th graders whose levels are entering, emerging and  transitional. Each group will maintain a total maximum of 20 students. During the after school  program on Wednesdays and Thursdays, students will receive instruction from three teachers.  The two teachers hold ENL/ Bilingual licenses and one teacher a common branch license, and  they are familiar with the needs of ENLs and have demonstrated various learning strategies for  reading and writing that are aligned to the Common Core Standards. Students will be sub  grouped according to their reading levels and grades. During the time allocated, students will  receive rigorous instructions focusing on all four modalities of NYSESLAT such as reading,  writing, listening and speaking skills. We will use methodologies learned from Teachers College  Workshop to enhance literacy skills, as well as content-based materials so students can be  exposed to rich academic language. The focus of the instruction will be content based so students  will be able to read non-fiction texts, understand scientific concepts and their corresponding tier  2 and 3 vocabulary. The goal of instruction is not only to teach content specific topics that are  aligned to the Common Core, but to move students at least two grade levels in their reading  skills. The language of instruction will be English. All records will be maintained, including  program notifications to parents in their preferred languages, student attendance, and student  portfolios, which  will be kept on file in the ENL room.  The students will also practice expository and narrative writing and the use of tools like semantic  mapping to organize writing. The analysis of the 2017-2018 Math State Test indicates that  students are in need of intensive intervention in Math, especially in number sense and operations.  Therefore, math instruction will be added to support the ELLs by increasing their vocabulary  word bank , used of pictures and manipulatives, modified teacher talk so the students will ask  have time to process questions and formulate responses during explicit instruction, use of  sentence frames ,etc.  Home language support will be provided by offering bilingual glossaries  and on line education programs, such as, Imagine Learning and RazKids.  Also, Mrs. DeJesus,  the Assistant Principal who will be supervising the program, speaks Spanish.  All program  notification letters will be sent out in the parent’s preferred home language.  Materials that are used for the After School Wednesday and Thursday as well as for the Saturday  Programs will be different than the materials used for daily instruction. Online educational  programs will be used to support this program: Imagine Learning, RazKids, Reading Rescue  pilot, and IXL.    Laptops will be provided for students to access to these online programs that  support differentiated instruction, and 2 desktops computers will be used to support the Imagine  Learning program. In addition, we will use fiction and non-fiction materials for small group  guided reading and for independent reading, writing as well as the NYSESLAT Student Practice  Books and ReadWorks. For teachers the audio CDs and the annotated teacher’s edition will be  purchased. These materials support the Common Core Standards and content area instruction in  the classroom.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             The ethnic composition of P.S 214K has changed in the past 3 years. As of June 2018, the school  has 924 students of which 122 are current ENLs, mandated to receive ENL services as per the  amended CR Part 154 regulations. The school also has a dual language program on grades  Kindergarten, First and Second. Given the increase of ELLs and the demands of the amended CR  Part 154, we must continue to the strengthen the skills of our ENL/ Bilingual Certified and all  teachers who hold Common Branch licenses on literacy and ENL strategies. To raise the  achievement levels of our ELL population, particularly our SIFE students, it is critical that all  teachers of ENLs differentiate and scaffold instruction.  P.S. 214K staff and teachers receive 80  minutes of professional development each week during Professional Development  day.  Professional Development is mandated on Mondays from 2:20 pm to 3:40 pm and on  Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 3:35 pm.  Beginning in September 2018, Administration and ENL  Coordinator will conduct a series of ELL workshops during this period on ENL strategies,  Specially Designed Instruction and RtI.  Teachers of ELLs, including classroom teachers who  co-teach with standalone ESL teachers, will attend these workshops. In addition, throughout the  school year our ENL teachers and teachers who work with our ENLs will attend various ENL  workshops offered by the Office of English Language Learners and ENL workshops offered by  Brooklyn North Field Support Center. Pedagogues and administration are encouraged to attend  professional learning sessions to enhance and deepen their knowledge of strategies to utilize and  improve the achievement of English Language Learners. The teachers who attend workshops  will turnkey the pertinent information to all teachers, who have ENLs in their classrooms. The  information is turn keyed during monthly meetings, common planning periods to discuss  effective strategies for instructing English Language Learners.  Agendas and attendance sheets of teachers that attended these meetings and Professional  Learning workshops will be kept on file. These workshops are no cost to the program. In  addition, teachers who work in the Title III program will receive ongoing PDs related to the  program throughout the length of the program on best practices, such as assessment, effective  strategies, vocabulary instruction and reading strategies. To ensure home and school connection,  the Parent Coordinator, Mr. Zakir Uddin, will also provide workshops to the parents of ENLs on  reading and comprehension strategies, online educational programs and test taking strategies.  Our topics of workshops that are provided by the ENL teachers will include the ELL  identification process, the various stages of second language acquisition, language challenges vs.  language disabilities, practices that are most effective in teaching ELLs, and analyzing data from  ELL assessments and the ELA exam to shape instruction.  Teachers will examine the latest  research on instructing ELLs and will use the Common Core Standards to guide them in creating  differentiated lessons and activities to meet the diverse learning needs of ELLs.  A focus will be  on incorporating into lessons the grade-specific skills outlined in the language proficiency,  speaking and listening sections of the Common Core Standards.   These professional learning opportunities have clear agendas, handout supports for educators,  along with the names of the teachers attending the workshops that are kept in the main  office.  Teachers will also examine the four sections of the NYSESLAT for each grade band and  will highlight the tasks and skills that overlap with the ELA exam.

In addition, an  expert will provide Professional Development for teachers on ELL reading strategies, vocabulary  instruction and best practices.    Furthermore, all teachers will receive Professional Developments on ENL topics from a CITE  ENL instructional consultant in addition to professional development on SIFE students and how  SIFE students are best supported and in the classroom. The school has adopted the Teachers  College Reading and Writing Programs. These professional developments will positively impact  the progress of ENLs in PS 214K. These programs will also support the language development  of ELLs.  The on site professional development seeks to provide access to high levels of rich,  cross curricula literacy using a variety of supports. It focuses on supporting teacher assessment  of language proficiency with ongoing assessment and setting of language goals. The programs  also examine the use of visuals, oral language practice, and instructional methods that respond to  the linguistic and literacy needs of students. Topics such as close reading, developing centers,  and note-taking are addressed.  The teachers will also receive ongoing, comprehensive training,  professional development, and coaching from the NYU RBERN consultant on topics such as:-  the newly amended CR Part 154- the ENL co-teaching model- how to teach academic language  to ELLs  through transferable skills- use of visuals and oral practice in the content area- using  background knowledge to help students make home to school connections- how to explicitly  teach phonemic awareness, phonics, and decoding skills in order to build fluency and vocabulary  comprehension to ENLsIn addition, the staff at PS214K will be highly attuned to the emotional  strains ELLs may have as they adjust to a new country and language.  The school will  offer PDs on:  - racial equality and disparity- cross-cultural communication, and the history and cultural  background of ELLs families- creating a supportive environment for families and their children-  using the buddy system for parents in order to engage them in the school wide events, meetings,  etc.The providers for Professional Development are:- CITE: ENL instructional consultant;  tentative start date: October 2018 to January 2019; Cost of this PD is $3,497.00.  - NYU RBERN: Gloria Ortiz, NYS ELL Compliance representative; start date: September 2018,  ongoing support- Citywide and BFSC ENL Workshops: all ENL teachers will attend: start date:  September 2018, ongoing support   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

In addition, informally teachers use running records on RazKids for assessing the literacy  progress of at-risk students and ELLs.  Using Fountas and Pinnell, teachers in all grades assess literacy skills three times per  year (fall, winter, and spring).  Using data from these assessments, classroom teachers collaborate with ENL teachers to  address the specific learning needs of the ELL students.  Teachers then use the data to shape instruction and to form groups.In  addition, Imagine Learning data are other tools we use to assess the comprehension skills of ENL students in grades 3-5.    The analysis of NYSESLAT (2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17) and the ELA State Test 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, indicates that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      reading and writing are the lowest modalities among our ENLs. The analysis of our 2016-17 Math State Test indicates that  students are in need of intensive intervention in Math.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The analysis of NYSESLAT (2016 and 2017) and the ELA State Test 2015-16, 2016-17, indicates that reading and writing are the  lowest modalities among our ENLs. Therefore, instructional focus and activities will be heavily concentrated in developing their  reading and writing skills. Additionally, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and reading comprehension will be taught. Our goal is to  foster the love of reading, while teaching various reading skills to enhance students’ reading and comprehension and speaking.  Curricula will be organized around “big questions”, involve authentic reading and writing experiences, and provide textual  choices and meaningful content for students. Our program will also focus on developing phonemic awareness especially for  the students who are in Entering, Emerging and Transitioning stages and reading comprehension and writing will be the focus  for students in the Expanding stages. In addition, our school-wide instructional focus is to use school-wide data to plan  standards-based, reading, writing and problem solving activities which will support mastery in academic and domain-specific  vocabulary within Literacy and Mathematics for all our students. Therefore, teachers are provided with training on TC Reading  and Writing, Math and ENL topics.  In addition, ENL students receive small group instructions from their ENL teacher using Wilson Reading Intervention and best  practices. ENL students who do not make the adequate progress and considered at-risk or below benchmark levels, the RTI  team and the ENL team will work in collaboration to select the times and students for the AIS reading intervention and math  support program. Then, the AIS teacher(s) provide additional Tier III intensive instruction 1:1 or in small groups focusing on  phonics,  decoding, comprehension skill and/or math skills to allow the academic progress of all ENL students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ENL staff and administrators analyze NYSESLAT scores to evaluate the success of our programs.  We examine the scores of  each individual ELL from year to year to ensure that all ELLs are going up at least one performance level (i.e. from entering to  emerging, transitioning to expanding), and that advanced students are achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  The EDAT  targets guide our analysis.  ENL teachers, the Data Specialist and Administrators received in depth training on EDAT as to how  to create and analyze its data. For performance that is stagnant, we identify the area - listening, speaking, reading or writing -  that is most difficult for the student.  This EDAT data helps shape instruction to ensure student progress.  Since reading  comprehension and writing are vital areas of focus for ELLs in the school,  the TC Reading and Writing Programs was  implemented in 2016-17 to improve our students' reading and writing skills. Teachers look to see that students are mastering  both the grade-specific skills outlined in the Common Core Standards and the skills needed to achieve proficiency on the  NYSESLAT.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to develop and analyze assessments, and to create rubrics that  are aligned to the NYS CCLS as well as the Targets of Measurement assessed on the NYSESLAT.  Data from the ELL periodic  assessments, Teachers College writing tasks, and Fountas and Pinnell running records help ENL and classroom teachers target  instruction in grades K - 5.  For students in grades 3 - 5, both ENL and classroom teachers use data from the NYS ELA  assessments to determine how instruction can be targeted for ELLs. In Math, teachers were provided with Professional  Development on how to solve problems using manipulatives, visuals, domain-specific vocabulary and create real-life math  problems in order to make Math more meaningful.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We will use methodologies learned from Teachers College Workshop to enhance literacy skills, as well as content-based  materials so students can be exposed to rich academic language. The teachers will select complex texts for read aloud during  the mini lesson. Through deconstruction and reconstruction of the complex texts, students will learn different literacy skills  such as grammar, vocabulary, main idea, context clues, sequencing and characterization, as well as content area knowledge. In  order to support student’s comprehension, scaffolds will be used during all lessons. One of the most important steps in critical  reading is to make predictions about a piece of writing prior to the first reading. For our entering and emergent readers, we  will use a strategy called taking a “book walk” where students make predictions prior to reading which enhance their  understanding of what they will read. This will give them opportunity to learn new vocabulary and comprehend the text. For  comprehension teachers will model different literacy skills, such as main idea and details, compare and contrast, sequencing to  help students’ comprehension as they are reading. As part of our Teachers College Workshop students will need to be read   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         independently and that will be supported by several online reading programs that will be used in the program as well as the  provided leveled library. Students have been tested through running records and they will have access to online reading  programs. In addition, students will also receive instruction to prepare them for the NYSESLAT assessment.We also support  our ENL students by inviting them to participate in our After School Program and the Saturday School Program in which  students receive targeted, scaffold, small group instruction along with ELA and Math Test practice.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ENL students take part in RtI screening to assess whether their literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade level  benchmarks. If an ENL student is thought to be at-risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill or competency, the student  receives  targeted instructional support to bolster development in this area. This support is delivered in coordination with  language support services. Classroom teachers ues Fountas and Pinnell running records, as well as periodic benchmark  assessments for math and ELA. Formative and summative assessments (NYSESLAT; ELA and Math NYS assessments) are also  used to measure students' progress.  In addition, the EDAT provides ENL teachers and General Education teachers the  adequate progress of the ENL students. ENL teachers and the Data Specialist were trained on how to interpret EDAT data and  share that information with the General Education teachers so they can target instruction based on the needs of ENL students.  All students receive rigorous, evidence-based Tier 1 instruction focused on promoting language and literacy development: oral  and written language, word reading and spelling skills, fluency and reading comprehension.   In measuring student growth, the  NYC Performance Assessments are administered in September, when available, to provide us with a baseline in ELA and math -  and again at the end of the school year.  Tier II students receive proactive support in the form of small guided reading groups,  conferencing with the teacher, peer to peer interventions and online resources. After school and Saturday academies are also  offered to ELLs who perform below grade-level.  In addition, the focus is on scaffolding instruction with the use of graphic  organizers, intensive vocabulary teaching of Tier 1, 2 and Tier 3 content specific vocabulary, as well as reading from various  resources. If the student continues to struggle and is not making adequate progress, we consider Tier III interventions, which  include intensive 1-on-1 instruction and collaboration with intervention teachers and other service providers.                              6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on the EDAT data, the NYSESLAT exams, ELA and Math Standardized State exams show that the greatest needs of our  ENL students are in reading and writing.  As a result, and to help students prepare for the NYSESLAT exam, ENL teachers, in  collaboration with classroom teachers, are focusing on improving both the reading and writing skills of our ENL students.  ENL  students receive additional support in reading and writing, as budget allows, through after school and Saturday Academy  programs, which offer test preparation and enrichment for our SIFE and newcomer ELLs. We also have increased resources for  our classroom libraries, purchased laptops and online language and reading tools such as  Imagine Learning licenses and Raz- kids subscriptions. For Math, we have bought an online subscription for IXL to improve the various skills for ENL students.  Moreover, we have added  online trade books, use of vocabulary visuals, have re-opened and expanded resources in our  school library, and implemented Teachers College Reading and Writing on all grades.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Part IV: ELL Programming  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63        Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As per the 2017-2018 SY, CR Part 154 mandates, the school offers an integrated ENL standalone program and a co  teaching integrated ENL program. Three licensed ENL teachers provide the integrated and standalone ENL services for  the six ELL levels in the heterogeneous K – 5 classrooms. For integrated ENL, the licensed ENL teacher provides the  services with a common branch licensed teacher, and co-teaches students who are grouped by their levels in order to  differentiate instruction. For standalone ENL, the students are grouped by their levels in order to ensure that their  mandates and educational needs are met. Since the proficiency levels vary in every ENL classroom, the certified ENL  teacher ensures that all students have met their mandates in both the integrated and standalone settings.Entering  students receive 180 minutes (four 45-minute periods per week) of both standalone instruction in a small group  setting as well as 180 minutes (four 45-minute periods per week) of integrated co-teaching in the larger classroom  setting with both an ENL teacher and an ELA teacher for ENL/ELA instruction.Per CR Part 154 mandates, flexibility is  given to the emerging and transitioning leveled students. Emerging students receive 180 minutes (four 45-minute  periods per week) of integrated co-teaching in the larger classroom setting with both an ENL teacher and a common  branch licensed teacher for ENL/ELA, and at least 90 minutes (two 45-minute periods) of standalone instruction in a  small group setting. Based on initial and ongoing teachers ’assessments, emerging students get an additional 90  minutes(2 periods) either in a standalone setting or integrated co-taught classroom with either ELA or other content  area. Transitioning students receive 90 minutes (two 45-minute periods) of integrated ENL services in ENL/ELA. In  addition, also based on initial and ongoing teachers’ assessments, transitioning students get an additional 90 minutes  (2 periods) either in a standalone setting or integrated co-taught classroom with either ELA or other content  area.Expanding students receive 180 minutes (four 45-minute periods per week) of integrated co-teaching in the  larger classroom setting with both an ENL teacher and a common branch licensed teacher for ENL/ELA or content area  instruction.As per the mandates, students whose levels are at the commanding level are also provided 90 minutes  (two 45-minute periods) of integrated ENL services in either ELA or a content area. During integrated co-teaching, the  ENL teacher and the ELA teacher provide scaffolding, vocabulary development, and other ENL strategies to support  the commanding level students in the class. In addition, the ENL teacher focuses on the linguistic and language  demands that the students need to access the content of the English lesson. The classroom is equipped with a leveled  library, in addition to some instructional materials in students’ native language.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      For the 2017-2018 school year, the dual language program will be offered in grades K-3. The program is staffed by  dual bilingual certified teachers. The instructional model is 50% Spanish and 50% English. Both literacy and content  are taught in both Spanish and in English. Instruction is delivered in one language at a time. The students receive  literacy in the Spanish language during HLA, math and science. Vocabulary development is the focus in both  languages. The bilingual teacher also uses ENL strategies in all other subjects. As per mandates, the ENL students in  the DL programs receive their mandated services from the dually certified bilingual and a ENL teacher in a standalone  setting as required by their ENL proficiency levels. The classes are comprise of approximately one-half native English  speakers and one-half native Spanish speakers. In this way, students act as language models for one another. In  Kindergarten through 3rd grade, we follow a self-contained, 50/50 roller coaster model, in which the teacher teaches  Language Arts word study, Science and Math in English one day and in Spanish the following day. Students spend an  equal time learning these subjects in both languages.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As per the 2017-20178 SY, CR Part 154 mandates, the school offers an integrated ENL standalone program and a co-teaching  integrated ENL program. Three licensed ENL teachers provide the integrated and standalone ENL services for the five ELL levels  in grades K - 5, which all contain heterogeneous levels. Flexibility is given to the emerging and transitioning leveled students.  As per the mandates, students whose levels are at the proficient/ commanding levels are also provided 90 minutes of  integrated ENL services in either ELA or a content area. In addition, services are provided to students who have reached their  proficient levels in the previous 2 years. For integrated ENL, the licensed ENL teacher provides the services with a common  branch licensed teacher, and co-teaches students who are grouped by their levels in order to differentiate instruction. For  standalone ENL, the students are grouped by their levels in order to ensure that their mandates are met. Since the proficiency  levels vary in every ENL classroom, the certified ENL teacher ensures that all students have met their mandates in both the  integrated and standalone settings. The classroom is equipped with a leveled library, has access to online reading programs  and laptops, iPads, in addition to some instructional materials in students' native language. In the integrated setting, the ENL  certified teacher co-teaches with the common branch K-6 certified teacher. Using differentiation, they provide scaffolding,  vocabulary development, and other ENL strategies to support the various levels of students in the class. Each year the ENL  teachers develop a schedule for all ENL students as mandated by the CR Part 154 .        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are taught in English through both the integrated and stand alone models based on students' proficiency levels.  The integrated model is essential in order to provide students with models of what is expected at grade level. The common  branch teacher works cooperatively with the ENL teacher to teach the same content at the same time. The content teacher  may present the content objective in a mini lesson and will present the content using close-reading, 'chunking' and other  strategies, while the ENL teacher provides ESL strategies through scaffolds, graphic organizers, visual support for challenging  vocabulary, sentence starters and provides explanations to help ENL students comprehend the material being taught. If  needed the native language is used for clarification. One of the 7 co-teaching ENL models will be used when working with  students. All tasks and objectives are aligned to the Common Core Standards using differentiated instruction for the various  proficiency levels of students. During these services students will continue to work to improve their reading and writing with  the support given by the ENL teachers. In Math, the common branch certified K-6 teacher models the lesson for the students  and the ENL teacher uses manipulatives, visuals and ENL strategies as a support.            4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   After administering the NYSITELL, students' whose home language is Spanish are given the Spanish LAB to evaluate their  proficiency in their home language. Students are offered the option to take the Math NYS assessment in their native  languages, using translated versions of the assessments if available, or oral translations through licensed pedagogues. In  addition, students are evaluated using the LENS, if they are identified as SIFE during the initial screening. In addition, PS 214  offers RazKids, a research based online reading support and Imagine Learning licenses for ENL learners as a language  acquisition support. Currently, the school's Go Math curriculum is also offered in Spanish so students can access the booklets,  glossaries and tutorials online       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For SIFE students, the ENL teachers ensure that they are receiving their mandated services outlined by the Part 154-2. The SIFE  students receive rigorous instructions focusing on all four modalities of NYSESLAT such as reading, writing, listening and  speaking skills. We also use methodologies learned from Teachers College Workshop to enhance literacy skills, as well as  content-based materials so students can be exposed to rich academic language. In addition, foundation skills such as  phonemic awareness, sight words, letter-word recognition and letter writing are taught at this level. The focus of the  instruction is also content based so students will be able to read non-fiction texts, understand scientific concepts and their  corresponding tier 2 and 3 vocabulary . The goal of instruction is not only to teach content specific topics that are aligned to  the Common Core Standards but to move students at least two grade levels in their reading skills. In addition, students will  receive alphabet practice to build phonemic awareness, learn to use sentence starters and graphic organizers to learn how to  organize information. During their instructional day, since they are at the early stages of language acquisition, they receive  instruction through Total Physical Response, chants, songs, rhymes. As additional support, AIS and student mentoring by  pedagogues are services that are also implemented to ensure that these students make adequate yearly progress. Students  use technology to access easy to read books, trace letters, and identify rhymes. Access to RazKids and Imagine Learning online  reading tool, are also provided and used as a support. We will also use instructional materials in English and Spanish from the  American Reading Company, that is designed for SIFE populations. In addition, after-school and Saturday Academy is offered  to SIFE students to ensure their success. For Newcomers, ENL providers ensure that the early stages of language acquisition is  met through small group instruction in an integrated setting with their peers as well as in a standalone setting. For early stages  the ENL teacher provides the following strategies that are also incorporated in the Teachers College curriculum, such as Total  Physical Response, vocabulary teaching using visuals, building on prior knowledge, providing sentence starters, using chants,  teaching blends, sight words. The content areas are taught through differentiated leveled texts. This allows students to learn  the same content through different texts that are at their reading levels to ensure comprehension. As an additional support,  students will have an opportunity to use Imagine Learning software that has various language acquisition supports. For  Developing students, the ENL providers and classroom teachers collaborate and closely monitor the progress of the student.  The focus of the instruction remains on reading for information, building on stamina and content vocabulary building along  with peer interaction. For Long Term students the focus is writing and reading for information. Trends show that the writing is  their weakness and that is the reason for the long term status. They will use content based materials so students can be  exposed to rich academic language so students will be able to read non-fiction texts and understand scientific concepts and  their corresponding tier 2 and 3 vocabulary. The few numbers based on EDAT prove that we do not have a large number of  long term ENL students. The majority of our long term ENL students are SWD. For Former ELLs the focus is vocabulary  enrichment and various reading strategies to ensure that they continue to receive support from a certified ENL teacher. Their  progress is closely monitored by the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   For ELL-SWDs differentiated, explicit, systematic and supportive instruction is provided by ENL specialists and Special  Education teachers. In a safe learning environment, students with multiple intelligences and learning preferences learn  through TPR activities, hands on materials, and tasks that are fit to their needs. ENL teachers provide the visual learners with  pictures, kinesthetic learners are given movements or gestures, logical learners are given definitions. The curriculum is  differentiated and scaffold supports are provided for SWDs along with supporting and enrichment materials (ex: leveled texts).  Will continue to use the Teachers College Reading and Writing programs to facilitate independent reading and writing. This will  include visual and hands on learning activities, modeling, scaffolds, graphic organizers, and more. Tasks are also Page 8 aligned  to the Common Core Standards and differentiated to their needs and their reading levels.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order to meet the needs of our diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency, ELL-SWDs are  being serviced in an integrated setting. If needed, ELL-SWDs are being serviced in a standalone setting one on one or with a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      small number of students of the same proficiency level. The school uses the standalone model for 2 units to service ELL  and SWDs. The classroom and ENL teachers collaboratively plan literacy strategies, using explicit teaching and flexible  grouping. The student's IEP is complied with to enable them to meet their IEP goals and attain English proficiency.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and math are focuses on Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students to help  further support their language acquisition skills and give them additional support in content area subjects. Tier III RTI services  are available through our AIS reading recovery teacher for ENL students who are not making progress even with classroom  interventions. Tier III RTI services use a variety of different programs based on students needs such as Wilson, guided reading  and math. These students are reviewed after a 6 week period to see if any progress is made. Student progress is tracked in  different areas such as phonics, vocabulary, and decoding, and reports are generated to track the ENL students' progress.  RazKids, a computer based reading program is used to support ENL students in reading so they have the opportunity to read  and listen to leveled texts and answer comprehension questions. Imagine Learning software, an online language acquisition is  also used as an additional support which focuses on phonics, sight words, every day language, reading and comprehension,  These reports can also be generated to track ENL students' reading time, academic and language acquisition progress.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      PS 214K will continue to use the Teachers College Reading and Writing programs which provide students with skills to access  high levels of cross-curricula literacy. In addition, the school offers after school programs and Saturday academies that support  ENLs in learning academic and social-emotional skills. The school also has a library which encourages students to read daily, in  both English and their native languages. We are using a school wide PBIS program which will also facilitate social-emotional  learning.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No services will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs have equal access to all school programs in PS 214K. Supplemental services are provided to all students in After-School  programs and Saturday ENL Academy, if the budget allows.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  RazKids and Imagine Learning online reading programs are provided for ENL students which can be accessed from home as  well. In Page 9 addition, the Imagine Learning online language and reading program is being used by SIFE and Newcomer ENLs  to support their language development and academic progress. IPads and lap-tops are available for small group instruction at  PS 214k. Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are accessible in the school and online. IXL online math program is used in the  classroom and at home. Each class is scheduled to attend the computer lab. Data from these online programs provides  teachers feedback on how to best adjust their instructions to meet the needs of ENLs and track their progress.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Newcomer ENLs are encouraged to write responses to literature in their native languages. Bilingual trade books are available  for ENLs to read, as are bilingual dictionaries and glossaries. Bilingual dictionary software is utilized. Bilingual paraprofessionals  deliver native language support to ENLs when mandated by their IEPs and when they are working in a classroom that has  students who speak the same native language. In addition, the GO-Math program provides a bilingual edition in Spanish to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      support native Spanish speakers. In the Dual Language programs, Spanish Language is being used in 50% Spanish and 50%  English model.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ENL teachers support ENLs by using appropriate age and grade level materials and resources using different entry points and  best practices. ENL teachers provide complex texts using ENL strategies to students of different ages and grade levels that are  aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Visuals, scaffolds, and hands-on materials are used to enhance  comprehension and ensure that students' language acquisition and content area needs are met. Information on services is  shared with all staff who are advocates for all students.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    RazKids reading program is provided for ENL students which can be accessed from home as well. IPads and lap-tops are  available for small group instruction at PS 214k. Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are accessible in the school and online. IXL  online math program is used in the classroom and at home. Each class is scheduled to attend the computer lab.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     There are no activities that are offered before the beginning of the school year. If the student enters during the school year,  the Saturday Immigrant and ELLA Programs as well as the ESL/SIFE After School Program are being offered. In these programs  students receive rigorous instructions focusing on all four modalities of NYSESLAT such as reading, writing, listening and  speaking skills. The focus of the instruction is content based so students will be able to read non-fiction texts, understand  scientific concepts and their corresponding tier 2 and 3 vocabulary. The goal of instruction is not only to teach content specific  topics such as math, reading and writing that are aligned to the Common Core Standards but to prepare students for the NY  State Standardized Math and English as well as the NYSESLAT exams. In addition, Parent Outreach workshops are offered to  assist newly arrived students and their parents so they can easily adjust to and understand the school environment. We had  also invited our ENL parents to student performances throughout the school year and to outside performances during the  Saturday ELLA program. For example, the Nai-Ni Chinese Dance Company performed for our Saturday programs. In addition,  parent workshops are offered on the summer slide, expectations for Kindergarten and on various academic health topics. The  school is working on building a supportive environment that responds to the immediate socio-cultural and linguistic needs of  the students and their families. Some of the activities that are also offered throughout the year are PBIS School Spirit Days,  PTA fundraiser days and movie nights. The PS214K staff needs to be highly attuned to the emotional strains these students  have as they adjust to a new country and language.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   For the 2017-2018 school year, the dual language program will be extended to not only grades K-2 but to  grade 3 as well. The program is staffed by dual bilingual certified teachers. The self-contained   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         instructional model is being implemented in the Dual Language Programs in PS 214K. The classes are  comprise of approximately one-half native English speakers and one-half native Spanish speakers. In this  way, students act as language models for one another. In Kindergarten through 3rd grade, we follow a  self-contained, 50/50 roller coaster model, in which the teacher teaches Language Arts word study,  Science and Math in English one day and in Spanish the following day. Students spend an equal time  learning these subjects in both languages. Instruction is delivered in both languages without translation.  Vocabulary development is the focus in both languages. The certified bilingual teacher uses ENL  strategies in all subjects. Printed language of Spanish and English are clearly separated in the DL self  contained classrooms; English is printed in blue and Spanish in red. English language bulletin board is set  up on one side of the classroom and Spanish language bulletin board on the other side of the DL  classroom. Teachers use flexible grouping and differentiation to meet the needs of native speakers and  language learners. Professional Development and Support       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The school has adopted the Teachers College Reading and Writing Programs. These programs also support the language  development of ENLs. The on site professional development seeks to provide access to high levels of rich, cross curricula  literacy using a variety of supports. It focuses on supporting teacher assessment of language proficiency with ongoing  assessment and setting of language goals. The programs also examine the use of visuals, oral language practice, and  instructional methods that respond to the linguistic and literacy needs of students. Topics such as close reading, developing  centers, and note-taking are addressed. The teachers will also receive ongoing, comprehensive training, professional  development, and coaching from the NYS Language RBERN on topics such as: - the newly amended CR Part 154 - the ENL co- teaching model - how to teach academic language to ENLs through transferable skills - use of visuals and oral practice in the  content area - using background knowledge to help students make home to school connections Page 11 - how to explicitly  teach phonemic awareness, phonics, and decoding skills in order to build fluency and vocabulary comprehension to ENLs. In  addition, the staff at PS214K needs to be highly attuned to the emotional strains ENLs may have as they adjust to a new  country and language. The school will offer PDs on: -cross-cultural communication, and the history and cultural background of  ENLs -creating a supportive environment for parents - using the buddy system for parents in order to engage them in the  school. The providers for Professional Developments are: - CITE: Center for Integrated Teacher Education, ENL instructional  consultant; - RBERN/NYU: Gloria Ortiz, NYS ELL Compliance representative; ongoing support - Learning Partners Program:  Zosia Sorbo, LPP Instructional Support: ongoing support and PS 230 school visits - Teacher's College ENL Workshops: all ENL  teachers. The TC Reading and Writing workshops are offered to all classroom teachers. The Language RBERN also offers  professional development on strategies for ENL literacies, and teachers will be scheduled to attend their city-wide PDs. The  school also has hired the services of CITE to provide professional development on literacy strategies to all teachers. All  teachers receive Professional Developments on ENL topics and from CITE, ENL instructional consultant who will provide  Professional Development on SIFE students and how SIFE students are best supported and in the classroom. The school has  adopted the Teachers College Reading and Writing Programs. These professional developments will positively impact the  progress of ENLs in PS 214k. These programs will also support the language development of ENLs. The on site professional  development seeks to provide access to high levels of rich, cross curricula literacy using a variety of supports. It focuses on  supporting teacher assessment of language proficiency with ongoing assessment and setting of language goals. The programs  also examine the use of visuals, oral language practice, and instructional methods that respond to the linguistic and literacy  needs of students. Topics such as close reading, developing centers, and note-taking are addressed.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  To meet the mandates of 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours of bilingual/ENL teachers to receive ENL  specific professional development, the ENL department will plan ENL Professional learning opportunities for all teachers, such  as reading comprehension, reading strategies, vocabulary learning, best practices in DFfT, etc. In addition, ENL teachers attend  district wide meetings provided by the district. Records and agendas are kept in the ENL room. In addition, ENL instructional  consultants will be providing Professional Development on best practices, vocabulary instructions and how to best impact the  ENL students' academic progress and language development. Parental Involvement           Parental Involvement      1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school will provide annual individual meetings with parents of ENLs to discuss program goals, progress, language Page 12  proficiency assessment results, and language development in content areas. In addition, individual parents may make  appointments with ENL teachers on Tuesday afternoons during parent engagement time. Translation services will be provided  by staff members who speak the parents home language or the Language and Interpretation unit. The ENL teacher will have a  list of parents' preferred languages to plan for their interpretation and translation needs. In addition, there will be workshops  offered to parents of SIFE students, parents of ENL students and students in Dual Language Programs.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  PS214K encourages and supports parental involvement with the goal of building strong parent involvement in our school. With  the encouragement of all parents to become active participants in their child's life and educational process, PS214k invites  them to participate in a variety of parent workshops and activities both at the school and district level. The school is working  on building a supportive environment that responds to the immediate socio-cultural and linguistic needs of the students'  families. In order to foster parental involvement in PS214k the following policies are being implemented. In addition, students  are provided information on the courses offered by the Office of Adult and Continuing Education, which is offered in our  building. TRANSLATION SERVICES AVAILABLE For written translation of important school documents, PS214k uses the NYCDOE  Translation and Interpretation Unit to provide translations and the NYCDOE letters that are available in several languages. For  oral translations we request the services of bilingual teachers. We make use of these staff members during Parent Teacher  conferences and other important school meetings (i.e. IEP meetings) and activities. Parent/Teacher Conferences and Meet the  Teacher Parent/Teacher Conferences are held three times a year at PS214K. Teachers are also available for Parent Engagement  every Tuesday afternoon from 2:20-3:00pm. Letters are sent home by the ENL teachers to invite parents to schedule  times/days that are convenient to them. These letters invite parents to provide the ENL teachers with their emails and phone  numbers so they can communicate with their student's teachers regularly, if so desired. Teacher school emails are included on  these communications. In addition, conferences can be scheduled before, during and after the school day to accommodate  parents’ schedules. Notices of when these conferences are held are sent home with students. At these conferences, parents  will have the opportunity to meet with classroom teachers as well as school-based teacher specialists (e.g. ENL teacher, SETSS  teacher, AIS teachers). School counselors, therapists and other staff members are also available to assist parents. In the fall,  “Open School Week” is held. Parents have an opportunity to visit their child’s classrooms and observe the daily teaching  methods and routines. In addition, our school hosts “Meet the Teacher” evening each September. These meetings are  designed so that parents can learn about the curriculum, classroom rules and students’ requirements. Translation and  interpretation services are available at this time through our parent bilingual buddies and staff members. Although parents will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         not have the opportunity to meet individually with their child’s teacher at this time, these meetings provide a valuable  opportunity to hear what students will be learning about during the year, discuss ways parents can help students at home, and  familiarize parents with the educational program. Coupled with Parent/Teacher Conferences, “Meet the Teacher” meetings  give parents a broad understanding of what their child’s school year will be like. Parents of ENLs are also invited to attend 2  meetings a year to discuss promotional policies. Pre- K and Kindergarten Orientation: PS214K hosts a Pre-K/Kindergarten  Orientation Meeting as well as a Kindergarten Dual Language Orientation Meeting for the parents of incoming students and  their families. The orientation is held in late spring, as well as the first day of the new school year, and gives families an exciting  preview of their children’s 1st years in school. Curriculum Fairs, Musical Performances, School Plays PS214K sponsors many  musical and curriculum-based presentations which provide an opportunity for parents to experience the educational activities  their children are taking part in. This is a great opportunity for the students to present their Page 13 experiences uniting the  curriculum with the Arts. Special presentation are also offered for prevention of bullying and respecting others. In addition,  parents and students participate in a number of extracurricular activities. These include Native Language Literacy Night, Math  and ELA game nights, PBIS School Spirit Days, PTA fundraiser days and movie nights. School Leadership Team (SLT): Our  parents are actively involved as members of the School Leadership Team. As per the Chancellor’s mandate, and in accordance  with Section 100.11, parents comprise half the members of the team. Through membership on the SLT, parents have  opportunity for planning and evaluating school programs and procedures, including the school‘s parent involvement policy.  English Language Learner (ENL) Parent Orientations Annual parent orientations are held for parents of ENLs and potential  ENLs, as specified in New York City Department of Education requirements. These orientations are provided so that parents  can make informed choices about programs for their children. School Sponsored Parent Workshops and Classes PS214K  provides many opportunities for parent participation by offering parent workshops on a wide variety of topics including:  Parenting Skills, Homework Help, Graduation, Testing and the Common Core Curriculum, Nutrition and Fitness, Summer Slide.  In addition, PS214k invited parents for various student performances throughout the school year as well as to performances by  outside performances during the Saturday ELLA Program. For example, the Nai-Ni Chinese Dance Company performed for our  Saturday School students and parents.To facilitate the adjustment to a new environment/community, the school is working on  building a supportive environment that responds to the immediate socio-cultural and linguistic needs of the students' families  by offering parent workshops related to school information, such as school timing, the attendance policy, bussing, the school's  grading policy, and the free lunch program. In addition, parents are instructed on how to use the NYCDOE and PS214K school  website to track their child's progress, special services, how to stay in contact with the school, and CBO Beacon and health  concerns. Also, our school offers ongoing English as a Second Language classes for adults. These workshops and classes are  scheduled at convenient times to accommodate parents’ schedules. These workshops and classes are facilitated and led by the  parent coordinator, counselors, administrators, and many teachers in the building.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sharon Mahabir, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Michael Friedsam                                                                              School DBN: 19K214  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration, parents/guardians of new students complete the HLQ (Home Language Questionnaire) to  indicate the language(s) spoken at home. Translated versions of the HLQ are available for parents/guardians  whose home language is not English. The form also informs the school of the language in which parents prefer to  receive information (both written and oral). The school's pupil accounting secretary is responsible for reviewing all  blue cards to ensure that the parents' preferred written and oral language (s) reflects the student's biographical  information in ATS. Also, parents communicate their language needs (both written and oral) to various staff  members at our school: the principal, the assistant principals, the school secretaries, the Bengali-speaking parent  coordinator, the ENL staff, the Spanish-speaking aides, and teachers, among others.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    English,Bengali, and Spanish  are the three main native  languages of the students at  P.S. 214K. The school also  has students who speak  Arabic, Urdu, and  Portuguese, although the  number of students who  speak these additional  languages are much lower.  While the school generally  does not have problems with  the written translations in  Spanish, some of our Bengali  families find it difficult to  read the written translations  produced outside of the  school. In general, we find it  more productive to translate  forms and letters orally into  Bengali. This is mostly done  by our Bengali-speaking  parent coordinator, and  several staff members who  also speak Bengali. Bengali  parents needing clarification  either call the parent  coordinator or come to the  school for assistance. Our  ENL department reviews  HLQ forms throughout the  school year and informs the  administration and staff of  written translation and oral  interpretation needs. To  ensure that parents receive  the correct written  translation, school staff refer  to ATS reports to verify  home language. The school  secretaries and Bengali- speaking parent coordinator  also play a major role in  identifying and reporting  written translation and oral  interpretation needs. As  mentioned above, the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75     school's pupil accounting  secretary indicates parents'  preferred written and oral  language (s) in ATS.

These notices  inform parents of school events, school  closings due to holidays, the location of the  main office, and  identification/documentation needed,  among other things.      P.S. 214K has purchased a website program  called E-Chalk. The website will be a direct  tool for school-home communication on the  latest schoolwide updates. Also, it will allow  teachers to post homework, lessons and  class events on the website.

Teachers, including  ENL staff, paraprofessionals, aides,  custodial staff and an assistant principal  provide oral interpretation services in  Spanish. Oral interpretation services  are needed on a daily basis and occur in  a wide variety of settings - both formal  and informal. Every day staff members  provide oral interpretion services in the  main office and on the phone. Oral  interpretation services are also  available during drop off and dismissal,  parent workshops, parent/teacher  conferences, assemblies and  ceremonies. Spanish and Bengali- speaking staff members are also  present at ENL parent orientation  meetings that are conducted by the  parent coordinator and ENL  department. At these meetings, a video  describing the various ENL programs is  shown in the native languages of the  parents.      PS214K has also purchased  SchoolMessenger, which is a telephone  outreach service to parents in their  native language. The service calls for  attendance, lateness, school events,  conferences and workshops.
