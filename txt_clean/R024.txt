This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Myra S. Barnes Intermediate School is dedicated to the belief that all students can meet high standards of excellence.  The school will provide a positive and supportive environment for all students, staff and parents. This will emphasize  the school and it's commitment in ensuring the children’s cognitive, creative and social growth. All our students will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      develop academic and social skills and responsibilities which will enable them to become productive and law-abiding  citizens of the community.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school collaborates with organizations such as NYC Urban Advantage, CASA-The Intrepid Museum, United  Activities Unlimited, CHAMPS, Beat The Streets and Staten Island Zoo.   Our Talent choices of Band, Performing Arts, Graphic Arts, Dance and Media allow students to choose areas of study  to be proficient in and continue learning while attending high school and beyond. Students also have the ability to  study a world language in either Spanish or Italian.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Over twenty percent of our student body consists of students with disabilities. Close to sixty students are in our  programs for Autistic students such as the Transitional Autism Program (TAP) and Horizon.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the last year our school has remained consistent in all elements of the Framework for Great Schools. This can be  seen especially in the School Quality Guide. Our focus this year continues to be around Collaborative Teachers and the  work we are doing with Learning Teams, Department Teams and Grade Teams and how teams are serving the needs  of students by examining student progress collectively.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R024   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1267   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In the 2017-18 school year our student attendance rate was 93.55% and we did not met our goal of 95%. We have  worked well to attempt to reach this goal but have fallen short due to matters out of our control.      A supportive environment where we discuss the importance of student attendance with students, parents and faculty  will be assessed constantly as we believe informing parents of how absences lead to lost instructional time is crucial.  It is a priority to reach our goal of 95% student attendance as it impacts student performance.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Teaching practices across classrooms are aligned to curricula and the Danielson Framework for Teaching to reflect a  set of beliefs of how students learn best. Teachers consistently provide multiple entry points to support student  subgroups with the curricula.   Across classrooms, core beliefs are evident in teaching practices resulting in work products reflecting higher-order  thinking.   A need to effectively align to the Framework for Great Schools is to raise awareness of teachers to provide questions  that lead to higher order thinking. Work around essential questions for a lesson or unit need development.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Barnes Intermediate School 24, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

The program will support ELL students by providing a place and  time to fully engage in a reading text.  Students will choose from one of two graphic novels to  read: The Arrival by Shaun Tan or Little White Duck: A Childhood in China by Na Liu. Students  will read and discuss the novel and the author’s point of view. Students will learn strategies for  reading comprehension,  such as graphic organizers, answering questions, summarizing, student  generated questions and so forth.  Students will answer questions led by the teacher and create a  vivid and well written account of the story. Through reading, students will understand the larger  picture of the world, their connection to the world around them and gain a sense of  understanding. Students will create a book review and interpretation of the book; by the students  for the students. Students will be able to review a book and use different means to interpret the  book (art, power point, pictures, writing, poetry, etc.). We will display their work in our  classroom 'gallery'.   Students who join the after school will also have the ability to get help in homework, extra  academic support, and enrichment activities through flexible groupings. This is particularly  helpful for students who may not have access to academic resources or help at home. This  program would offer academic support for English Language Learners to fulfill their  requirements for school. All ELL students are eligible to participate in the program but will be  targeted based on NYSESLAT, ELA, and MATH state wide tests in Spring 2018. They will also  be targeted as a result of their first marking period report card grades for our new students in 6th  grade, and classroom observations. The program will last from November 1, 2018 until the end  of May 2019.   Instructors will teach students strategies and skills to increase comprehension  and critical thinking. Students will have access to computers and iPads, as well  as the school library to increase computer literacy, literacy in general and to fulfill online  assignments for school. These additional hours will create a place for ELL students  to get help,  review and learn how to make progress with their native speaking counterparts in class. Students  will have a personal instructor guide them in a safe environment to learn and grow in a small  setting.   The ENL teachers will keep attendance records via an Excel spreadsheet on the shared computer  in the classroom. There is no data analysis to be provided. IS 24 only has only one year to reflect  on.

Evidence of participation is kept by  providing copies of certificates of completion or registration receipt from attendance at  workshops. The expectation is that evidence will be seen in the classroom for more inclusive  learning for ELL students along with native born speakers. ENL Teachers will be provided  opportunities for out-of-school learning during the instructional day to attend workshops at  Fordham University and local institutions to build strategies in making progress with ELL  students. The ENL teachers keep a binder with information from PDs, which include the agenda,  certificates and paperwork associated with PD. PDs will positively impact the progress of  ELLs by having teachers that are up to date with policies, strategies that work, and newly  published materials. PDs allow teachers from different schools to collaborate on what works and  what doesn't work. Content area teachers will have turn key or ENL created PDs to address  the  particular needs of our students. Content area teachers will be chosen due to the ELL  population in their classrooms.

We will provide a translator for parents either in house, via computer or the school  translation services provided by the DOE. Parent engagement activities will target specific  strategies that will impact higher achievement for ELLs and will make all inclusive events more  readily available to ELL parents.  The topics discussed will have emanated from the feedback  that parents will have given to us via a survey sent home.  The workshops fit into the dates  because they enmesh themselves with the open houses for high schools, as well as the transition  from grade school to high school.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Formative assessment tools that IS 24 uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs include, but are not limited to  NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA scores, Periodic Assessments (ELA and Math), Skedula/PupilPath, and teacher made assessments.  The insights that the data provides allow the ENL instructors to create lesson plans that are individualized to the students’  needs, either as a collective group or specific student. Teachers can derive from the information provided through  Skedula/PupilPath where the weaknesses and strengths of the students lie. If many of the students are having trouble with  information and understanding, literary response and expression, critical analysis and evaluation and other concepts, the ENL  instructors gears the class to review, relearn and become proficient in those specific areas, while still maintaining the strengths  that the students have in other areas.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         There are several structures that we have in place to support guided instructional planning for ELLs. Our ENL department  reviews data collected from various standardized formative assessment, including IEPs, and teacher created assessments given  throughout the year to guide instruction.    A student’s new language development is considered in instructional decisions. All ELL information is emailed to all teachers of  ELLs at the beginning of the year. Teachers have access to the English language proficiency level, YOS, native language, IEP, etc.  Teachers work collaboratively with the ENL instructors to ensure that students can partake in class as much as possible, no  matter their level of English proficiency. Teachers take into consideration students strengths and needs in order to create  lesson plans that provide quality and understanding. ENL instructors are in constant collaboration with the general education  and special education teachers. The ENL instructors attend professional development given by supervisors, correspondence via  email and phone in order to make sure that all teachers involved in the students’ academic progress are included in driving  instruction. ENL instructors also talk with guidance counselors as well.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessment or baseline/benchmark assessments being used to identify baseline/progress and areas of need  include but are not limited to: NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA and Math state test, department made benchmarks (ELA & Math)  given twice a year, and teacher made assessments.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are several structures in place to address intervention once the summative data has been gathered.    Interventions are introduced/provided based on students’ needs to support teachers, administrators, and parents. Students’  progress is continually monitored to determine which intervention should be maintained, changed, or omitted.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Outcome assessments data that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are: NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA and Math  state test, department made benchmarks (ELA & Math) given twice a year, and teacher created assessments. The ELL Data  Analysis Tool and the RLAT from ATS are used to convert students’ data on the NYSELAT to determine their strengths and  needs based on each modality.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Structures in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our programs are:         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         As per CR Part 154.2 freestanding ENL is delivered as a standalone and integrated model.      Beginner / Entering  ELL receive a total  of 360 minutes, 180 minutes standalone and 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA.    Low Intermediate / Emerging ELL receive a total of 360 minutes, 90 minutes stand alone, 180 minutes integrated  ENL/ELA  and/or 90 minutes as standalone or integrated.    Intermediate / Transitioning ELL receive a total of 180 minutes,  90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA  and or 90 minutes  standalone.    Advanced / Expanding  ELL receive a total of 180 minutes, 180  minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 0 minutes of  standalone.    Proficient / Commanding  ELL receive a total of  90 minutes integrated, and 0 minutes of standalone.      Students pulled for standalone  classes are provided with all facets of learning English, using ENL methodologies and  approaches. Students are serviced in grade bands of sixth and seventh or seventh and eighth, heterogeneous and  homogeneous classes.  Depending on students test scores, strengths and weaknesses, students will be placed into  different groups. Beginners will form a group of their own; however, exposing beginner students to all level ELL  students allows them to interact in their own language, learn from their peers, create friendships and promote social  interactions in an informal and safe atmosphere. Low intermediate students may be placed with high level beginners,  while high intermediate and advanced students may be placed together. These groups also can vary depending on the  dynamics of students, grade levels, and scheduling difficulties.    All instructional minutes are reviewed by the Special Education grade A.P. and the Principal, to ensure that students  are receiving mandated minutes of ELL instruction. The grade AP and Principal collaborate with the ENL instructors for  the proper placement of students. The ENL instructors, follow the new mandates according to the revised CR Part  154.2, push into class and provide support for students and the general education teacher via ENL methodologies and  strategies. The ENL instructors collaborate with general education and special education teachers to make sure that  lessons are constructed for ELLs and general education students. Teachers work together to assure that all students  are receiving well planned and explicit instruction. The ENL instructors further support students during small group  instruction in an integrated setting.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     b. TBE program. N/A   c.  DL program.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided to proficiency levels in each program model by  reviewing CR Part 154.2. Entering students receive 360 minutes in total. 180 minutes are delivered in standalone ENL and the  other 180 minutes is delivered as an integrated ELA/ENL class. Emerging students receive 360 minutes in total. 90 minutes are  delivered as a standalone ENL, 180 minutes are delivered in an integrated ENL/ELA class, and 90 minutes are delivered through  ENL/ELA or any other content area class (Math, Social Studies etc.). Transitioning students receive 180 minutes in total. 90  minutes are delivered in an integrated ENL/ELA class, and 90 minutes are delivered through ENL/ELA or any other content area  class. (Math, Social Studies, etc.) Expanding students receive 180 minutes in total. 180 minutes are delivered in an integrated  ENL/ELA class and/or any content area class.

(Math, Social Studies, etc.) The  mandated number of minutes is reviewed with the Special Education Assistant Principal and the Principal to ensure that the  mandated number of minutes is correct.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   To support ELLs with the academic rigors of school demands, ENL teachers deliver content area instruction, using ENL  strategies, approaches and methodologies. Students comprehend content area ideas and enrich language development  through a variety of different approaches.     The ENL teachers uses grade level content area textbooks, word walls, printed materials, the use of computers, visuals aids  (posters, pictures books, flashcards, educational games), and graphic organizers to help promote ELLs to achieve higher  academic grades. The CCSS also demands a new set of vocabulary and accountability that is infused into the instructional  setting. Creating accountable talk allows students to learn the terminology associated with the CCSS as well as using it and  practicing the terminology so that it becomes part of their word inventory.    Approaches used with ELLs include but are not limited to the following:  Whole Language Approach  Input Hypothesis  Affective Filter Hypothesis  Funds of Knowledge  Think/Pair Share  Graphic Organizers (K-W-L, Anticipation Guides, etc.)  Monitoring  Inferencing/ Predicting  Identifying important information  Generating and answering questions  Synthesizing  Summarizing  Organizing ideas  Making connections  Activating Prior Knowledge  Teaching mini-lessons  Modeling  Providing practice opportunities  Reflecting  Guided Reading  Total Physical Responses (TPR)  General/ Content-specific literacy skills    Approaches include a variety of educational games for students in developing vocabulary and language fluency, Vocabulary  Directions, MyWord, Let’s Talk, Quiddler, Bananagrams, etc. Educational games and differentiating instruction allows for  students with different styles of learning, the ability to learn and retain information. Content area subjects are delivered to  ELLs using a variety of methods and approaches. ENL teachers and content area teachers work collaboratively to ensure that  students are receiving quality education. Teachers actively modify the nature of assignments using multiple points of entry.    • Repeat/rephrase text  • Use vocabulary with specific contextual clues  • Ensure that reading has a specific purpose  • Categorize vocabulary   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      • Word banks  • Teach note taking  • Filling in the gaps for those who lack past experience    Differentiation of instruction ensures that as many students as possible are comprehending information and language. These  and other strategies are used on a continuous basis throughout the school year. ELLs have access to computers to aid  comprehension during class instruction. The ENL teachers use many types of approaches and strategies to better enable  students to learn in a meaningful manner: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, linguistic, videos, written work, listening skills, words  walls, etc. It is imperative for students to start acquiring specific language, learning experiences that use a variety of  techniques, learning higher order thinking and learning skills. Successful language acquisition for the ELL can be encompassed  in making sure that the school is aware of Learner Characteristics (including internal factors such as attitude, motivation and  personality), Situational or Environmental Issues, Prior Language Development and Competence and understanding the Three  Levels of Language Proficiency. There have also been six shifts in the CCSS which ENL teachers must incorporate into their  classroom instruction: Balanced Literary and Information Text, Knowledge in the Discipline, Complexity of Text, Text Based  Answers, Writing from Sources and Academic Vocabulary. The ENL teachers use scaffolds to “bridge for language and content  learning to achieve the CCSS and language, literacy and higher ordering thinking skills for ELLs” (CCSS & ELLS by Estee Lopez,  Ed. D, 2012).    The ENL teachers of entering and emerging level students will instruct and assess for print concepts, phonological awareness,  phonics, and word recognition/fluency. The challenge for entering and emerging level ELLs will prove difficult for these  students because they are at the initial stages of the second language acquisition process. Therefore, the ENL teachers must  use explicit and age appropriate instructional approaches to teaching reading in English, as well as the form and function of  language and literacy (CCSS & ELLS by Estee Lopez, Ed. D, 2012).     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   IS 24 is currently in the process of searching for screeners for those students in which high incident languages occur.  At the  present time, Fontas & Pinnell and state assessments, such as the Spanish LAB-R, are used to appropriately evaluate students  in their home languages throughout the year. Standardized tests provided in foreign language are also used to evaluate home  language. (Math, Science, etc.)     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Instructional plans for SIFE students are developed to bring students up to grade level. General Education teachers and  guidance counselors will be notified that these students are SIFE. Teachers will create a buddy system with peers or classmates  who can show students around and help them adjust to the daily schedule. Teachers will initiate small group activities,  collaborative teaching, individualized goals, and greater focus on SIFE students so they can achieve greater academic  success. SIFE students will begin their academic education where they left off. Through proven strategies, teachers will enable  students to link new information to prior knowledge. SIFE students will make gains by learning the fundamentals of math,  English, social studies and science. It is important to understand that SIFE students will learn better when academic subjects  flow across all domains. Therefore, a student learning about the scientific reasons of erosion of beaches in earth science and  then continues to language arts, that ELA teacher can take the same vocabulary within the same context and then expand on  the ideas of the words throughout lessons to come. The math teacher can take vocabulary words found in science or English  and state them in math word problems. Students are exposed to the vocabulary in different settings and often throughout the  day or week. Teachers reinforce language as a living entity and make sure that it can easily connect to all subjects and students  are being exposed to the language more often. This allows students to see words and themes in different subject areas.  Students see the many ways language and subjects are connected across all domains. As a result, SIFE students gain a greater  knowledge base which leads to academic success.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47        b. Students who have been enrolled in NYC Public Schools for less than three years have goals set to familiarize them with  learning the basics of the English language. This allows students to function socially in and out of school, and succeed  academically. Students will begin to understand and use their *BICS and *CALPS dependent on the situations they find  themselves in. Students become familiar with statewide exams given in Math, English, Science and Social Studies. Teachers  help students by providing them with samples of the NYS exams (Math, ELA, NYSESLAT, Social Studies, and Science). Students  receive DOE approved glossaries to use in class and during statewide exams. The students become familiar with these exams  in terms of phrases and terminology, strategies, etc. The ENL instructors review techniques for taking high stakes tests such as  reading directions and questions first, skimming the passages for answers, using context clues, practicing from past exams,  reviewing frequently used vocabulary, and reviewing rubrics. Students will also have support structures in place, such as,  buddy systems, guidance counselors, outreach programs for parents, including PTA meetings, school letters translated, classes  to learn English for parents, and more.    *[BICS- Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skill/CALP-Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency]    c. Students enrolled in ENL between 4-6 years will have their test data (New York State ELA and Math scores, NYSESLAT scores,  ELL Periodic Assessment tests, Pupil Path, E-LAP, RAI and other diagnostic exams) analyzed by their teachers to determine  their needs. Examining test data enables teachers to identify specific weaknesses, and allows them to develop higher quality  lesson plans attuned to their students’ needs. Strategies used to aid students in class and reach proficiency on  the NYSESLAT include vocabulary enrichment, reviewing rubrics from tests, increasing reading comprehension, enriched  language, grammar, word walls, graphic organizers, etc. Teachers will incorporate educational games, online reading and  listening activities to increase language acquisition and academic achievement. The information enables teachers to develop  plans based on student data and needs.    d. Long Term ELLs, having completed six or more years of ENL, will have their test data disaggregated and abilities assessed.  Reading comprehension, vocabulary enrichment through a variety of methods (read alouds, guided reading, think aloud, etc.)  and other proven methods, such as words walls, online activities, visual aids, graphic organizers will all be used to help long  term ELLs reach proficiency and improve in all their academic areas. Students will focus on their needs while still maintaining  their strengths. Students will obtain new techniques, strategies, and skills to achieve their best. Periodic evaluation through  teacher observations and assessments (RAI, ELL Periodic Assessments, teacher made exams), will aid in identifying student  deficiencies. Students may also be evaluated for educational weaknesses unrelated to language acquisition. Teachers, with  parent’s permission, will contact appropriate bilingual evaluators, to help identify a student’s weakness, if necessary.    e. Plans for students who are commanding/former ELLs (in years one and two after testing proficient) have integrated ENL  support. F-ELL (former-ELLs) are given support in ELA and/or other content areas. ELLs within two years of testing receive ENL  support. ELL students can seek help with the ENL teachers for extra help, during Homework Help, from 7:10 to 7:40 in the  morning, five times a week, and AIS/or at risk, so that they can become successful in their classes. Students who fall into the  category of having received commanding on the NYSESLAT within two years are entitled to support such as testing  accommodations and class help. Testing accommodations for F-ELLs (in years one and two after testing proficient) are as  follows:    Accommodations for LEP/ELL students on state assessments:    Schools may provide testing accommodations to LEP/ELLs, as needed, on all NYS ELA and content-area assessments (i.e.,  Mathematics, Science and Social Studies). Testing Accommodations for LEP/ELLs students on NYS ELA and Content-area  assessments include:    • Time Extension (all exams): Schools may extend the test time for LEP/ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments  and on Regents Examinations. Principals may use any reasonable extensions, such as "time and a half" (the required testing  time plus half that amount), in accordance with their best judgment about the needs of the ELLs. Principals should consult with  the student's classroom teacher in making these determinations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48        • Separate Location (all exams): Schools are encouraged to provide optimal testing environments and facilities  for LEP/ELLs students. NYS assessments may be administered to LEP/ELLs individually or in small groups in a separate location.    • Third Reading of Listening Selection (English Language Arts Exams Only). Proctors may read the listening passage three times  to LEP/ELLs on grades 3-8 English Language Arts assessments and on the Regents Comprehensive Examination in English.    • Bilingual Dictionaries and/or Glossaries: LEP/ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects  except foreign languages.    • The bilingual dictionaries and glossaries may provide only direct one to one translations of words. Bilingual dictionaries  and/or glossaries that provide definitions or explanations are not permitted. Bilingual glossaries in the content areas are  available for downloading at: http://www.p12.nysed.gov/biling/bilingual_glossaries.htm    • Simultaneous use of English and Alternative Language Editions are not allowed for English Language Arts Examinations. For  state examinations for which the Department provides written translations, ELLs may use both English and an alternative  language edition of the test simultaneously. However, they should be instructed to record all their responses in only one  language. The alternative language edition used by the student should be so indicated on the student's answer sheet.    Note: There are no translations of English Language Arts examinations.    • Oral Translation for Low Incidence Languages is not allowed for English Language Arts Examinations. Schools may  provide LEP/ELL students with an oral translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by the  Department. All translations must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No  clarifications or explanations may be provided. Translators should receive copies of the English edition of the tests one hour  prior to administration. The Department's Office of Bilingual Education and Foreign Language Studies, and the Bilingual/ENL  Technical Assistance Centers (BETACs) can assist schools in locating suitable translators.    • Writing Responses in the Native Language are not allowed for English Language Arts Examinations. LEP/ELL students making  use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended  question in their native language. Scoring the tests is the responsibility of the school. However, the Department's Office of  Bilingual Education and Foreign Language Studies, and the BETACs can assist schools in locating persons who can translate the  students' responses into English to facilitate scoring of the answer papers.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs having been identified as special needs are often addressed using different methodologies to help them make progress.  The ENL instructors collaborate with Special Education teachers, Speech, Hearing, Visual and OT/PT therapists.      Input from the team of teachers enables the ENL instructors to develop instruction that helps meet the child’s individual  needs. Students in classes with paraprofessionals benefit from further differentiation of instruction. Paraprofessionals are an  integral part in helping students with special needs achieve success.        Some instructional strategies used in class include reading comprehension, vocabulary enrichment through a variety of  methods: read alouds, guided reading, think aloud, create an authentic experience, breaking down on grade level text to  relatable information to students, redirecting, refocusing, high interest low level reading, etc. Other proven methods, such as;  Think/Pair Share, Retelling, activating prior knowledge, K-W-L, and using words walls, online activities, visual aids, graphic  organizers, technology (not limited to only these methods) will all be used to help ELL-SWD test out and improve in all  academic areas.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and flexible scheduling to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and  attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. IS 24 reviews ELL-SWDs IEPs through collaboration with  special education supervisor, ENL teachers, SETTS teachers, service providers and Special Education Assistant Principal to  address the best way to achieve ELL-SWD academic success. ELL-SWDs are reviewed throughout the year. IS 24 also uses  parallel programming, curriculum modification, universal design for learning, scaffolding, as well as including AIS, Homework  Help, Wilson, UAU/Saturday programs, and have equal access to all programs offered at IS 24 (PPT and School Assessment  Team).      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  AIS, Homework Help, UAU/Saturday Program for ELA and math, after school programs, guidance counselors, social worker,  and ENL services over the number of mandated minutes are provided at our school in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New programs are in the process of being reviewed. Implementing a grading policy for the varying levels of ELLs that cover  teacher expectations of students’ abilities.  Professional development for supervisors and teachers on how to identify ELLs  with disabilities.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs by ensuring that they are equally invited to all programs given at the  school. Some ways that we ensure their access is to translate school letters to parents and use email blasts (some are  translated to those parents who participate). ELLs and their parents will be notified of school programs via parent/teacher  meetings, Pupil Path, IS 24 website, impromptu meetings and/or phone calls (using in house translators or the L & I Translation  Unit). After school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in our building include: Homework Help, Saturday ELA and Math  programs, AIS, regents and specialized high school prep. Aside from the educationally focused groups, our school also has after  school sports programs, robotics, wrestling, leadership, peer mediation, science night, literacy night, peer helpers, peer  leaders, drug prevention, Penny Harvest and Penny Harvest Roundtable, Respect for All, National Tobacco prevention, and  many more programs offered throughout the year.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teachers use a variety of resources in content area teaching:  • Scholastic Code X  • Prentice Hall Mathematics CCS  • Eastern Hemisphere Part A  • Eastern Hemisphere Part B  • United States History: New York History Beginning to 1877  • Quick Review Math Handbook  • New York Science  • The American Nation  • Elements of Literature    Books that are specific to ENL instruction include but are not limited to the following:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      • Discovery Links Social Studies  • The Idiom Advantage, Fluency in Speaking and Listening  • Introduction to Academic Discovery  • Even More True Stories  • Put it in Writing  • Achieving on the NYSESLAT  • Stories with a Twist  • What a World  • Action English Pictures  • Fundamentals of English Grammar  • Be a Better Reader  • Moving on in Spelling  • Various Reading Level Books/ Mentor Text    ELL students are exposed to a variety of text books provided by the DOE, as well as an array of newspapers, magazines,  websites, etc.  • www.nytimes.com  • npr.org  •newsela.com  • BBC  • Voice of America  • The Library of America.org  • http://americanfolklore.net  • Smithsonian magazine, New York Times magazine    Native language material such as:  • Bilingual dictionaries  • Text books that come in two languages  • School library resources   • Google translate     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is assessed via the Spanish LAB-R, interviews with students, parents, educators, and paraprofessionals  when appropriate.  ENL is taught in English; however, it is important to support home language within the class. ELLs have a library in the  classroom that provides books in native languages. The ENL instructors also provide access to computers and translation  services. In this manner, students always have the opportunity to see what they are learning, and reading in their language.  Students are also handed bilingual glossaries at the beginning of the year and are encouraged to bring in electronic bilingual  translators to school so they can participate in class work/class as much as possible. Students are also grouped in same  language groups so that they can discuss what is happening in the class and assist one another. Supporting native language is  an important part of learning a second language. Students who keep up with their native language will be better able to learn a  second language.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels by making sure that they are grouped  according to skill level and grade level whenever possible. Students are exposed to a variety of resources so that they can learn  and absorb as much new information as possible in a setting that is appropriate for them. Sources that students learn from are  The Newsela, Mentor Texts, NYTimes.com, NPR.org, voanews.org, NYSESLAT preparation by Attanasio & Associates, Action  English Pictures, and so forth. The instructors create lessons that are high interest and vocabulary level appropriate for the  students. Students are required to participate in the four facets of learning, Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing and are  encouraged to use these four modalities every day to optimize English language acquisition. The instructors utilize the  standards for ENL and introduce CCSS in class on a daily basis.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activities that IS 24 provides to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year is open house for all  incoming 6th graders. In this manner, incoming 6th graders are introduced to 6th grade teachers, are addressed to by the  principal and assistant principal, and are welcomed to look at the school and classrooms. Students are allowed to walk around  the school with their parents/guardians. Students get to see the classrooms and meet potential teachers. In this manner,  students familiarize themselves with their new environment. The parent coordinator interacts with parents and addresses  needs. Parents are also invited to look at the school webpage and see what goes on during the school year (The school website  is multilingual). Students will also have support structures in place, such as, buddy systems, guidance counselors, outreach  programs for parents, including PTA meetings, school letters translated, classes to learn English for parents and more. School  staff involved with newcomers includes, but are not limited to, ENL teachers, Special Education A.P., Parent Coordinator, Pupil  Accounting Secretary, Paraprofessionals, Teachers, and OT/PT.     17.

What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for all ENL personnel at our school is constant. The ENL teachers attend workshops  throughout the year. Workshops create a forum in which the ENL teachers can learn new methodologies and techniques to  improve teaching.    IS 24 is currently implementing workshops/professional development meetings for all teachers of ELLs. These PDs will be  taught by the ENL instructors. Conferences will be conducted Monday afternoons during Collaborative Learning Team  Meetings.  These meetings will focus on effective strategies for ELLs and how to keep students of all levels engaged in the  classroom. PD Dates are scheduled for twice a month during Collaborative Learning Team Meetings.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lenny Santamaria, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Myra S.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The needs for written translation and oral interpretation changes from year to year. Therefore it is reviewed  annually with the principal, assistant principals, staff, students, and parents during our PTA meetings or any  chance meeting that we have with parents throughout the year. Staff is informed of students’ whose home  language is other than English, years of service, level of English according to NYSITELL or NYSESLAT and if they  have an IEP at the beginning of the school year and/or upon admission. In this manner, staff is able to  communicate effectively to the parents regarding students. Our findings have revealed that in order to support  the non-English speaking parents of our school, that the translation department provided by the DOE and our  multilingual state certified teachers are able to translate both written documents and verbal information in a  timely fashion. Both ELL students, and parents of students who speak a second language at home, are able to rely  on our school for translations (verbal/written) and be a part of the school community. Parents and students are  able to attend functions, receive quarterly progress reports, upcoming events, parent/teacher conferences, IEP  meetings, and all other school related events with the aid of an interpreter.
