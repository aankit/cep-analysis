This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Hudson High School of Learning Technologies is to promote and develop the art of inquiry so that our  students are confident self-directed learners who are able to understand the world, appreciate multiple perspectives,  participate in the progress of their community and become empowered personal advocates.    Hudson HS is dedicated to cultivating strong individuals and future leaders, who will be able to:     Use inquiry as a means to clarify information, expand knowledge and connect concepts.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9           Access and assess informational sources, process data, facts and opinions, and communicate new ideas   through the development of transliteracy* skills.     Deconstruct complex problems and develop collaborative multi-faceted solutions.    Act with integrity, increase their resiliency, and respect diversity.   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Hudson High School of Learning Technologies is currently a limited un-screened high school located in the Bayard  Rustin Campus in Chelsea area of Manhattan.    HHSLT has maintained an above average graduation rate with 82% of students graduating within four years.  Nonetheless, it has struggled with helping students pass Global History, US History and Living Environment Regents  exams o their initial attempt. These exams require a deeper focus on literacy. The 2016 inquiry into the root cause of  this challenge determined that most of our incoming freshmen enter HHSLT with a below grade reading level. It was  recommended by those that undertook the inquiry study that a comprehensive, school-wide literacy program be  developed and implemented collaboratively.   HHSLT's improvement plans are easy to use and used often as evidenced in the implementation of the Right to Read  class that occurs three times per week. In 2018-2019 we aim to ensure that our literacy improvement plan focuses  exclusively and directly on curriculum implementation and improving instruction to improve student achievement.   School leaders at HHSLT have obtained broad buy-in to the literacy development plan - being developed by a large  number of people in a very transparent environment. This collaboratively designed plan remains measurable,  coherent, concrete, and comprehensible to teachers and students. As evidenced in 2018-2019 literacy plan our school  wide literacy plan remains seen as proactive work, not as compliance to a mandate.   HHSLT maintains three major strategic partnerships: 1) Big History Project (BHP), 2) Pencil, and 3) AP4All    BHP is an organization created to build a Big History course for high school students. The BHP team works with HHSLT  to revise and refine the Global History curriculum and makes all assets available for free on  www.bighistoryproject.com. The goals of the course is to support the mission of HHSLT to think critically and broadly,  while aiming to ignite a passion for inquiry and exploration. "In addition to helping students master the sequence and  scope of 13.8 billion years, the course focuses on three essential skills: thinking across scale, integrating multiple  disciplines, and making and testing claims." (https://www.bighistoryproject.com/media/bhp-assets/BHP-FAQ- 2014.pdf)    HHSLT partners with PENCIL in effort to provide opportunities for students to use their literacy skills within the  business community – at any level – through one of three main programs: 1) internships, 2) Company employees  facilitating interactive career readiness sessions 3) Volunteers from companies sharing their talents directly with  students, offering students the opportunity to develop skills necessary for post-secondary college and career  achievement.    AP for All is a part of NYCDOE's Equity and Excellence initiative, ensuring access to a rich and challenging education for  all. Not only will students have the opportunity to participate in AP courses, as a school, Hudson is working on aligning  our curriculum to AP standards so that instruction is rigorous from 9th through 12th grades.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Hudson has students participating in the integrated co-teaching (ICT) program, Special Education Teacher Support  Services (SETSS) program, and the D-75 program. These students require additional services from a special education  teacher and additional material resources. Further, these students are given testing accommodations.    Students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), require modified assignments to access the rigorous content  delivered in content classes. Teachers require time to collaborate with each other to develop the rigorous content,  modifications, and the method of co-teaching that will be used to deliver the content effectively. During this cycle,  specifically the assessment, the Special Education teacher will provide testing accommodations to students who are  entitled. Teachers require time to assess students strengths and barriers post-assessment to continually design  modifications appropriate to student need.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which HHSLT has made the most progress over the past year is in  providing a more supportive environment to students with below grade level literacy. This is qualified by the creation  of HHSLT's Right to Read Program and quantified by the STARS Literacy Assessment that is given at the end of every  cycle. This has translated to an improved ability to align assessments to curricula and analyze information on student  learning so that teachers can adjust instructional decisions at the grade team and individual levels.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M437   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   476   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      1.  According to our 2017-2018 school Quality Review, the majority of Hudson teachers are engaged in   structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations as they consistently analyze assessment data and  student work for students on which they are focused. The impact of these collaborations has resulted in the  promotion of the achievement of school goals and in improved teacher practice and progress toward goals for  groups of students.   2.  Hudson’s achievement data indicates our students are generally not performing at the level needed to   meet state standards and be college and career ready. Based on the following data:   3.           o  Average pass rate for core content classes is 83.75%, while the average pass rate for core content   Regents exams is 43.15% (see report)   o  Student responses to the SY17-18 School Quality Guide questions aligned to Rigorous Instruction:   Academic Press, indicate:      o  Our SY1718 School Quality Review Report rating in Quality Indicator 1.2 Pedagogy is developing.   Our reviewer observed, “students are unevenly engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and  student discussions inconsistently reflect high levels of student participation.”   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         we have hypothesized that the root cause of our below state standards student achievement is that all  students are not being “intellectually engaged in challenging content through well-designed learning tasks  and activities that require complex thinking” (DFT 3e HE). Engagement varies greatly between classes and  among students, and evidence indicates an inability to transfer skills and knowledge from the classroom to  broader assessments, such as Regents exams, AP exams, CUNY assessments and SATs.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Timeline: At the start of the 2018-2019 school year all parents/guardians of students with IEPs (possibly 504s) will be  invited to an informational session in the beginning of the year. Parents/guardians will be informed of graduation and  Regents requirements, IEP.testing accommodations and post high school transition. Additional information will be  available to all parents/guardians catered to their student's grade. Additionally, all parents will have coffee and bagels  with the principal and be given a brief introduction of common core instruction at HHSLT and how best to support  their child(ren). Teachers, students and parents will visit three or four classrooms and have a discussion about what  they see. One leader will write a narrative which will be shared later with all the members of the instruction rounds.  This helps the stakeholders understand our vision, philosophy and protocols that the educators use at HHSLT.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  HHSLT's strengths relative to the Framework for Great Schools is providing a more supportive environment to  students with below grade level literacy. This is qualified by the creation of HHSLT's Right to Read Program and  quantified by the STARS Literacy Assessment that is given at the end of every cycle. This has translated to an improved  ability to align assessments to curricula and analyze information on student learning so that teachers can adjust  instructional decisions at the grade team and individual levels. The result of this is students being supported, and  challenged by their teachers and peers to a greater extent.    The priority need that will be addressed in HHSLT's goal and action plan is to continue to build upon customizing  literacy Instruction to be inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core in all classrooms. The June 2018  STARS assessment results quantify the consistent gains HHSLT students have made in literacy with the average HHSLT  student achieving an average lexile number of 1152.   HHSLT students will continue to build upon literacy gains in an effort to achieve grade level literacy and higher  Regents pass rates that measure above HHSLT's peer group.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

Planning & Preparation Effective teachers plan and prepare for lessons using their extensive knowledge of the  content area, the relationships among different strands within the content and between the subject and other  disciplines, and their students’ prior understanding of the subject. Instructional outcomes are clear, represent  important learning in the subject, and are aligned to the curriculum. The instructional design includes learning  activities that are well sequenced and require all students to think, problem solve, inquire, and defend conjectures  and opinions. Effective teachers design formative assessments to monitor learning, and they provide the information   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27         needed to differentiate instruction. Measures of student learning align with the curriculum, enabling students to  demonstrate their understanding in more than one way.      2. Classroom Environment Effective teachers organize their classrooms so that all students can learn. They maximize  instructional time and foster respectful interactions with and among students, ensuring that students find the  classroom a safe place to take intellectual risks. Students themselves make a substantive contribution to the effective  functioning of the class by assisting with classroom procedures, ensuring effective use of physical space, and  supporting the learning of classmates. Students and teachers work in ways that demonstrate their belief that hard  work will result in higher levels of learning. Student behavior is consistently appropriate, and the teacher’s handling of  infractions is subtle, preventive, and respectful of students’ dignity.      3. Instruction In the classrooms of accomplished teachers, all students are highly engaged in learning. They make  significant contributions to the success of the class through participation in high-level discussions and active  involvement in their learning and the learning of others. Teacher explanations are clear and invite student intellectual  engagement. The teacher’s feedback is specific to learning goals and rubrics and offers concrete suggestions for  improvement. As a result, students understand their progress in learning the content and can explain the learning  goals and what they need to do in order to improve. Effective teachers recognize their responsibility for student  learning and make adjustments, as needed, to ensure student success.      4. Professional Responsibilities Accomplished teachers have high ethical standards and a deep sense of  professionalism, focused on improving their own teaching and supporting the ongoing learning of colleagues. Their  record-keeping systems are efficient and effective, and they communicate with families clearly, frequently, and with  cultural sensitivity. Accomplished teachers assume leadership roles in both school and LEA projects, and they engage  in a wide range of professional development activities to strengthen their practice. Reflection on their own teaching  results in ideas for improvement that are shared across professional learning communities and contribute to  improving the practice of all.      Part 5c.

HHSLT's strength in developing partnerships with businesses, and community-based organizations is evidenced by is  strategic partnerships with Big History Project (BHP), Pencil, and the NYC Skills Lab.   BHP is an organization created to build a Big History course for high school students. The BHP team works with HHSLT  to revise and refine the Global History curriculum, and makes all assets available for free on  www.bighistoryproject.com. The goals of the course is to support the mission of HHSLT to think critically and broadly,  while aiming to ignite a passion for inquiry and exploration. "In addition to helping students master the sequence and  scope of 13.8 billion years, the course focuses on three essential skills: thinking across scale, integrating multiple  disciplines, and making and testing claims." (https://www.bighistoryproject.com/media/bhp-assets/BHP-FAQ- 2014.pdf)   HHSLT partners with PENCIL in effort to provide volunteer opportunities for students to use their literacy skills within  the business community – at any level – through one of three main programs: 1) internships, 2) Company volunteers  facilitating interactive career readiness sessions 3) Volunteers from companies sharing their talents directly with  students, offering students the opportunity to develop skills necessary for post-secondary college and career  achievement.   NYC Skills Lab is a pilot program at HHSLT in an effort to expand the "quality and quantity of 21st century skill building  experiences that prepare students for success in college and career" (http://www.nycskillslab.org/about/). The pilot is  focused on integrating 21st century skills into formal and informal programming, enhancing adult capacity to provide  constructive skills-based feedback and aligning collaboration among educators and employers.      Data from Skedula shows that as of June 2017 30% of parents are utilizing our electronic grade book resources to  support student academic progress. Data from Parent Teacher Conferences show that 25% of parents attend this  event. Skedula data further shows a correlation between families who communicate regularly with their child's school  using the email and anecdotal feature on Skedula and greater scholarship. HHSLT's has, therefore, prioritized  engaging families in order to support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and the the Common Core Learning  Standards.

Grade teams meet twice weekly, in accordance with scheduled times. Using protocols during CPT,  teacher grade level teams will examine student work and analyze student achievement data, including growth and  gaps, to inform evidence-based adjustments to units, lessons and teaching practices.     Additionally, teams will utilize CPT meetings to conduct inquiry work around developing interventions to support  student achievement in that grade and conduct student-talk sessions according to a protocol. Each Grade Team  Leader is the point person for their grade and is in charge of facilitating team meetings and disseminating weekly  minutes. Each Grade Team Leader is a member of the Hudson Leadership Team and meets weekly with the  administrative team.   DURING PD:    Discipline meetings will take place the first and third Wednesday of each month. Educators will meet for the last 45- minutes of the larger whole-group meeting to engage in work related to instruction, including curriculum  development, unit planning consistent with the Danielson Framework and the Common Core Learning Standards,  creating performance tasks and interim assessments, item analysis and reflection.    Curriculum maps are a living document and will be revised throughout the course of the  year. Data analysis of interim  assessments and classroom assessments will be used to inform the editing process. Teachers are part of grade teams,  are team leaders and serve on various committees.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1.

Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Hudson High School of Learning Technologies, in compliance with The  Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Hudson High School of Learning Technologies, will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., Elementary and  Secondary Education Act (ESSA),/State accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card,  School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

According to the data from last year,  the majority of the ELL population have between a third  and fourth grade independent reading grade equivalency. ELLs uniformly received their lowest  scores in the comprehension conversation area, which includes skills such as identifying details  and making inferences. Additionally, a review of the data found in star , finds ELL students,  particularly those in the lower high school grades, have lower Regents and Measure of Student  Learning (MOSL) scores than their Non-ELL Peers.  Moreover, the work of the NYSESLAT  data analysis revealed that ELLs have serious gaps in academic language, which affects their  academic achievement in reading, writing, and other content areas. As a result of this data  analys total of 44 students will receive direct instruction via a program called Reader's Theatre.  We have a total of  Thirteen 9th graders:  3 Transitioning; 8 Expanding, Two Emerging. We  have a total of `Fifteen 10 graders. 4 Transitioning and  11 Expanding. As far as the 11th grade,  we have a total of 9 students, 2 transitioning and 7 expanding. in the 12th grade, we have 2  transitioning and 3 expanding.  Reader's Theatre is a style of theatre program that involves  students in reading aloud. In this  program students will have an opportunity to read scripts  created from grade level- books, stories, or their own created scripts  based on students' interest.  In order to enhance engagement and reinforce concepts learned in the classroom. The goal is of  this program is to enhance student's reading skills and confidence by having them practice  reading with a purpose. and to help students prepare for state exams that assess their skills and  knowledge. The focus of the program is to develop academic language and literacy skills as they  practice reading comprehension and use language in a real life setting. The program will be  taught by two English as a New Language (ENL) teacher and one certified English teacher.  The  44 students will be present for each two-hour session after school on Tuesdays and Wednesdays  from 3:35 to 5:35.  The first hour will be dedicated to small flexible grouping instruction. The  second hour will consist of Reader's theater presentations where students will have the  opportunity to showcase learned skills through acting Students will be divided into 3 groups of  15 each and taught by the three respective teachers. Every student in the program will receive at  least 50% of ENL Services. The English teacher and the ENL teachers will collaborate in the  delivery of the instruction.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information    The program will commence on the third week of January 2019 (January 14th) and conclude in  the second  week of June 2019 (June 14th) for a total of 16 weeks The total week Supplemental  materials for purchase will include Reader's Theatre materials and other resources available in  the school as well as online resources.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  During the 2017--2018 school year, all ELL students at Hudson High School of Learning Technologies are being administered  the Star Reading Assessments. Additionally Hudson school has  taken  a continuous improvement, data-driven approach to  improve student performance, using item analysis, portfolio assessment, assessment tools such as: NYSITELL, MOSL and other  indicators to identify and address student weaknesses while targeting areas for growth. Outgoing assessment will be both  formal and informal. To meet and exceed Common Core Standards, students in grades 9-12 will complete benchmark  assessments in reading and mathematics.Results generated from these assessments, will help teachers focus on specific  students' areas in need of extra instructional support and to make instructional decisions.  Students will also be exposed to a  variety of teacher created assessments to evaluate their  English proficiency level. Teachers from all disciplines will examine  work from ELLs,  to assess progress.  Students will abe assessed periodically to monitor progress and determine efficacy of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      protocol.Teachers will assess students around concepts of print, letter identification, letter sound, and spelling assessment  (sight words). They will use this data to inform their instruction during their lessons, conduct student conferences, form small  groups, Shared Reading, Interactive Writing and Read Alouds.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?     After reviewing and analyzing the data we have noticed that ELLs are lacking literacy in their native language. The data thus far  indicates that the majority of the ELL population have between a fourth and fifth grade independent reading grade  equivalency. Additionally, the ELLs uniformly received their lowest scores in the comprehension conversation area, which  includes skills such as identifying details and making inferences.  In response to these scores, the ENL team will  meet with  students individually  to discuss their English proficiency level as well as their  goals for the upcoming year.  We will use the EDAT tool  to group  students based on their English proficiency level. ELL students will also be selected to participate in our R2R literacy program  as well as our reward program.  In addition, the  grade level teams  will continue to  work to  implement and modify literacy  instruction based on the bank of previously introduced literacy strategies. These include: making connections, questioning,  monitoring for meaning, visualizing, comprehension + synthesis, inferences, making predictions, determining importance in  fiction and nonfiction texts using the pop and lock method, decoding text, making inferences, using the slow down the zoom  method, understanding root words + prefixes  suffixes to create meaning, using context clues for word comprehension,  compare and contrast, and cause + effect. Teachers will continue to explicitly focus on modeling and requiring certain literacy  strategies to be used in all subject areas. At grade level team meetings, teachers from all disciplines will examine work from  ELLs,  to assess progress in making literacy progress. Students will be assessed periodically using the STARS Assessment in  order to monitor their progress and determine efficacy of their pedagogy.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The ENL team will analyze the results of the NYSESLAT using the EDAT tool. Grade teams will review previously introduced  summative assessments from the 2016-2017 school year. These assessments include the English Language Art exams, the  Mosls, and  other state assessments. The ENL team will identify if ELLs are making progress and in the process of exiting the  program. For ELLs who are not making progress we will  analyze the specific  area of struggle and design activities with skills  that allow them to practice and master that specific area. Grade teams will also work collaboratively in their weekly meetings  in an effort to continue to explicitly focus on enhancing instruction in an concerted effort to engage student in learning and  increasing their literacy.  Additionally, The majority of the ELL population identifies as English dominant and requests to take  all state exams in English. The pass rates for the ELL population on Regents remain lower than the overall pass rates for the  school, most closely approaching overall pass rates on U.S. History. The largest discrepancy in pass rates between ELLs and  non-ELLs is in English and Global History. Only ELLs classified as Advanced passed Regents exams or earned above a Level 2 on  state exams.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The success of the ENL program is evaluated based on formative and summative assessments throughout the year in the ENL  class as well as parent's feedback. Grade teams Meet with the ENL teachers twice a week  to ensure that ELLs have the  language tools to perform on the same level as their peers in subject areas. When analyzing data we measure the amount of  progress made by our ELLs overall compared to our non-ELLs.  In addition, Administrators and  teacher teams analyze  formative assessment to monitor the effectiveness of our program implementation and students language development.  Moreso, the team analyze the results of the NYSESLAT  using  EDAT tool  to identify if ELL's are making progress and in the  process of exiting the program. For the ELLs who are not making progress, we will analyze the specific area of struggles and  design activities with skills that allow them to practice and master that specific area.ELL Periodic Assessments will be used  during the 2017-2018 school year to assess progress from the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT scores. The ENL teacher will use the data  to inform on the efficacy of the altered ESL curriculum.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Hudson use ongoing formative assessments to monitor student progress. Teachers use the data and make the needed  adjustments to lesson and unit plans in order to provide multiple entry points for ELLs. At risk ELLs in grades 9-12  will receive  explicit language instruction, comprehensible input, sentence starters, manipulatives, graphic organizers, technology etc. In  the event students don’t make any progress, students will be targeted in small groups, through the use reward instruction If  no progress is made students will receive intensive individual intervention.During the academic year of 2016-2017 our  team  will meet regularly to analyze and discuss student data and identify common trends. This information will be utilized to  develop professional development, make curricular adjustments and provide targeted intervention for our ELL population.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In the beginning of the school year, we use the NYSESLAT data to evaluate and inform our ELL program. We print the RLAT  report and  closely look at a breakdown of the results using the EDAT tool.  Based on an analysis of the breakdown  we  determine the  amount of minutes required for each ELL student enrolled at HHSLT.  We then analyze NYSESLAT data further in order to  determine which modality students need particular supports so that students can be strategically grouped in order to  maximize teaching supports.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The first whole staff professional development  offered at HHSLT is about getting to know our ENLs. This means ENL teachers  review RLAT reports and utilize the conversion table in order to breakdown NYSESLAT results. Next, ENL teachers  meet with  the grade level teams  once per week and discuss best practices with colleagues. Teachers are to implement and utilize  strategies that are agreed upon with the grade team. Formative and summative assessments are created to monitor and  inform pedagogical adjustments to instruction. If it is determined that the student would benefit with an alternative schedule  aimed at more intense literacy instruction and ELL student’s schedule will be changed so that they will receive Rewards  (focuses heavily on pronunciation and comprehension) and Right to Read literacy program.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL teacher primarily provides integrated instruction to subject area classes whereby offering additional literacy  support. All students regardless of their English  proficiency level  are grouped by grade level  in only one section.  Additionally, the stand alone model is used  to ensure that the students are getting  the required amount of  stand  alone they need to succeed as well as more direct instruction based on his/her specific language needs. During the  stand alone model,  the teacher supports the ELL students during  small group setting either in a corner of their  classroom or out of the classroom. During the Stand-Alone program Teacher's use a variety of instructional  approaches through differentiation in order to provide students with access to the content,process and product These  include the use of visuals, manipulatives, explicit modeling, repetition and the use of artifacts.  During the ENL integrated model, the ENL teacher  successfully collaborates with the classroom teachers by  bringing  techniques and strategies that can better benefit our ELL students. These include the use of visuals,  manipulatives, explicit modeling, repetition and the use of artifacts. In addition, other activities are also used to meet  the needs of our ELL's. close reading, focused reading, reading or language analysis, skills, conventions, independent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         writing practice and group discussions. The students are encouraged to apply organizational techniques and employ  vocabulary in all subject area classes, with the ENL teacher making specific recommendations of how to use skills  based on an awareness of the content of each of the subject area classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   In collaboration with the school administration, and  teachers review NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data for students in each class to  ensure that the language of instruction is properly distributed within the daily instructional program. The data tells us which  students fall into the entering, emerging, transitioning and expanding categories. The ENL teacher works closely with the  school programmer and personally oversees the development of each ELL’s schedule to ensure that the maximum level of  support possible is provided to each student. The teacher and administrators are familiar with the minutes requirements in CR  Part 154 and use this knowledge to guide schedule creation.   The majority of our students fall within the transition  and  expanding area. The ENL teacher provides the mandated minutes to the majority of students through the Integrated and  stand alone model. To ensure the mandated minutes of instruction are provided we look carefully at the level of each student  and determine the amount of standalone and integrated ENL services required for each student.  We then look at the ENL  programs specifically designated  at Hudson for Standalone and Integrated ENL. All  our merging students are provided 360  minutes. 90n minutes during the standalone  and 180 minutes during Global integrated ENL/ELA. Our  transitioning  ELL  students are provided 180 minutes of instruction. 90 minutes are provided during integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes  during  our R2R stand-alone program. Our Expanding students receive 180 minutes during our Global  integrated ENL. Our  former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL during Global.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In the Freestanding ENL program, all content instruction is delivered in English. All teachers employ visuals and modeling to  support verbal and written input and reinforce content understanding for language learners. Each grade team at the school  also focuses on a particular set of academic vocabulary across subject areas to ensure that ELLs are developing an in-depth  toolbox for academic writing. The ENL teacher consults with all subject area teachers to make recommendations for enhancing  content specific vocabulary instruction and providing comprehensible input to all students. As such, students are developing  the language required for the complex argumentation and reasoning skills required in the CCLS.  Materials used to support  instruction are technology, dictionaries, electronic translators.  During the Integrated ENL: The classroom teacher shares the  lesson plans in advance with the ENL teacher. The first 5-10 minutes of instruction are given to the ENL teacher for ENL  support.  The ENL teacher begins the lesson by going over the vocabulary using visual, repetition, and vocabulary games such  as heads up, card games etc. During the standalone all content instruction is delivered in English. A group of ELL students are  scheduled to meet with their designed ENL teacher. Every lesson is carefully planned to ensure  that the demand of NYC  learning standards are met. Our lessons are shared with administration using the eDoctrina Tool. The administration work  closely with the ENL teacher to ensure that the learning standards for each lesson are uploaded in eDoctrina are met. If the  standards are not being identified a follow up meeting with administration is conducted to ensure the necessary support is  provided.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students who speak Spanish are enrolled in Spanish language and culture classes taught by native speakers who assess their  needs and develop literacy skills in Spanish.   Teachers of newcomers make instructional decisions based on NYSESLAT data  and students needs.  Every child learns at a different pace. Therefore, teachers use different instructional approaches  to  evaluate students that come from different backgrounds and, as well as,  strategies to reach those students.  The use of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      explicit instruction, scaffolding and differentiation is an integral part when it comes to making instructional decisions. Teachers  form groups based on students levels and needs. The use of visuals, vocabulary, questioning and student discourse is a pivotal  part in the teachers planning.   The teachers work collaboratively to adjust and revise the curriculum in order to provide  multiple entry points for ELLs. Additionally, The ENL teacher uses current research in the field of Second Language Acquisition  to help classify the needs of ELLs in their various stages of development. The majority of our  ELL population has mastered BICS  according to the anticipated acquisition period of 2 years. Based on assessment, the language needs of the students lie in  developing specific academic language, and the curriculum is adjusted to focus on these skills.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.SIFE are provided with concrete visuals and models where possible to support understanding as the students develop more  abstract thinking skills. Students are provided reading materials on their level and given a period of focused reading time to  build comprehension skills. The language requirements of each content area are evaluated and particular language supports  (such as targeted vocabulary and sentence starters) are provided to enhance language development.  b. For newcomers, content instruction is made comprehensible with the support of visuals and models. Teachers provide  focused vocabulary instruction at an appropriate level, and support students in producing artifacts that show understanding  with limited language use Additionally, the ENL teacher aids content teachers in selecting specific language skills involved in  particular lessons for focused language practice. The ESL teacher also helps create sentence and paragraph frames to assist  students in writing for subject areas. ENL instruction focuses on foundational language needs, including basic language for  communication, while still providing academic language supports to be used in writing across subject areas. Faculty at the  school converse with students in their native language, allowing students an outlet for free expression and a mode for clearly  expressing any needs.  c. ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years receive content area instruction in English and academic language support through a  discrete ENL class. At this stage of language development, students typically have well developed conversational capacities but  require additional language support to express themselves in an academic context. Where possible, the ENL teacher instructs  students in how to use organizational frames, but encourages students to write independently, having memorized key phrases  from the frame. Vocabulary development is continued in content classes.  d. Long-term ELLs are assessed for particular needs with the goal of providing students the needed boost to reach proficiency.  At this stage, many of our ELLs struggle with listening skills, so teachers are encouraged to give verbal input, slowly removing  visual supports and encouraging students to attempt to visualize the meaning of the language independently. Long term ELLs  also receive academic language supports in a discrete ENL class and are encouraged to build complex clauses appropriate for  showing the type of nuanced thinking often used in academic contexts.  e. Former ELLs are placed in sections with current ELLs and general education students so that they continue to receive 2 years  of additional focused language support in subject area classes.  f. All ELLs and Former ELLs receive extended time for all exams including State and Local.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs with IEPs are placed in ICT classrooms so that they receive more focused attention as a result of the reduced student to  teacher ratio. In these classrooms, visual and auditory supports often accompany text to support students as they develop  independent reading skills (computers, google docs, electronic translators)  Additionally, teachers provide focused language  and organizational strategies to aid students in written composition, with frames and sentence starters provided as necessary.  Kinesthetic activities such as labs also enforce understanding. Our ELL-SWDs are exposed to the same educational  curriculum/material/resources as our regular students. However, in order to provide the access to academic content areas and  to accelerate English Language Development, our teachers implement the following: higher order thinking skills and language  development; small group instruction(during small group instruction, students are exposed to hands on manipulatives, leveled  text using Literacy Level Intervention (L.L.I); outside resources such as articles; visual aids (charts, pictures, word wall, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      smartboard). For reading, teachers include strategies like revision, re-reading, chunking of words, letter sounds, stretching of  words, using labels, activating prior knowledge, word association, teaching cognates, and teacher modeling.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs travel in sections with general education students and learn in classrooms where a learning specialist supports the  work of the content teacher. Our SWD's teacher's modify and differentiate lessons based on students need.  Some of the  things that teachers use to help ELL-SWD's are changing the way materials and classroom activities are presented: such as:  instructional approaches, differentiation, scaffolds, manipulatives, hands-on, group work, exploring and incorporating flexible  programing into the students IEP in order for the student to experience a more restrictive learning environment.  For example,  a student in a self-contained special education class can have a program recommendation to receive SETSS in a general  education classroom during instructional periods.  Lessons are planned using the Common Core Standards with modifications  to meet each of the students' academic needs and IEP goals.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      During the 2017-2018, we are considering the implementation of  more digital content  to enhance instructional practice. Also,  we will primarily use  theh integrated model  as a means of instruction for all our ELLs. During the integrated English a New  Language model, the ENL teacher will bring  scaffolded activities  in to all content areas (ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies)  such as visuals, games and other activities that will allow studnets to develop and internalize the concept and vocabulary being  taught in the classrroom. Lessons and objectives will be developed and differentiated to meet the needs of the ELLs.  Additionally,  a licensed ESL teacher who currently focuses on teaching Spanish Language and Culture will move more toward a  teaching role that specifically supports ELLs. As a native Spanish speaker, this teacher’s role will include a needed focus on  native language supports for Spanish speaking ELLs, the majority of our ELL population. We are working to develop a native  language literacy course for these students that will focus more specifically on their academic language needs in Spanish,  thereby bolstering their language development through addressing the Common Underlying Proficiency (CUP).        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs have access to the same courses, extracurricular activities, and support services as the non-ELL population at the  school.  ELLs have the option of joining school programs and teams such as MOUSE Squad, after schools clubs. They are given  written and oral invitations based on the recommendation of their teacher.   If recommended by a teacher, ELLs also attend  the aforementioned subject-specific after school programs to enhance their learning in a particular content area. Some of the  supplemental available programs for ELLS  are Reader’s Theater. During reader’s reader students perform by reading scripts.  We use this program to enhance ELLs reading skills and confidence by having them practice reading with a purpose.  Additionally, we offer Zero period instruction for newcomers. This program focuses on equipping the students with the  necessary vocabulary tools used on a daily basis.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  During the year 2017-2019, all 9-12 students th will be using wordly wise vocabulary program. Additionally, our 9-12 students  will be enrolled in our reward literacy program. Students will also be exposed to teachers created curriculum with  differentiation for ELLs.  Hudson High School of Learning Technologies is a 1:1 school; each student has a personal laptop during school hours that they  carry with them to all classes. The computers allow teachers to offer lessons with multiple access points by taking advantage of  the rich visual, auditory and textual resources that may be compiled into a digital source. Student output may also be  differentiated; ELLs have multiple modalities for expressing content mastery using the laptops. Each classroom at the school  also has a word wall that includes content specific vocabulary as well as the general academic vocabulary, a uniform list agreed  upon by each grade team for each unit cycle. Additional support materials included posters, electronic dictionaries, radios and  leveled literature. Most classrooms with ELL students have listening centers equipped with books, tapes, or CD's that support  language development and content area instruction. Some books are available in the classroom. Technology is infused into all  curricular areas through the use of in-classroom computers, a self-contained Technology enrichment lab, mobile lap-top cart  on each floor, and a library media center. Students have ample opportunities to use technology to demonstrate and     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL program, students and parents always have access to translations services should they require them for  communication. Additionally, Spanish-speaking ELLs may take a Spanish Language and Culture class to build native language  skills     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Hudson high School targets academic language skills appropriate for reading and writing at the highschool level detailed in the  CCLS.Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students are receiving their corresponding units of study  as  outlined in the CR Part 154. These minutes required allow for added lessons in basic communication/oral skills and for further  differentiation in content lessons in Science and Social Studies.  Students learn to access language and content through  rigorous and diverse learning experiences that are aligned to their age, grade, language proficiency and needs.  For ELL SWDs  we provide hands-on differentiated activities in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies according to their IE     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ENL teachers from the building have shared  a google doc where information  is shared  pertinent to all our English Language Learners.  We constantly share new events and professional development that  can benefit our ELLs.   To ensure that all ELLs needs are met, we provide opportunities for students  to work together  on trips  and other school related activities. Additionally, to address the emotional psychological needs of all ELL students all  schools  have access to a school psychologist, speech therapist and school base clinic.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ELLs new to the DOE have the opportunity to attend an ENL specific orientation with their parents. Translation services are  offered.  ELLs also are invited to the school-wide new students orientation. The ENL teacher describes the program to all  entering parents and students at the orientation and is available to meet individually with new admits to discuss the program.  ELLs who enroll throughout the year meet with the ENL teacher and the teacher hosts a specific mini-orientation with the  parents to familiarize the family with the program.  Additionally before the start of the new school year, all new students  including ELLs were invited to participate in a big celebration called Extravaganza, which allowed students to meet each of the  teachers and ask questions and celebration with food, music and games.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     ELLs may take Spanish or Spanish Language and Culture as a part of their LOTE requirement for graduation. The ESL services  are largely delivered during an academic language elective period.  Additionally, students who are interested in receiving an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         advanced diploma have to the opportunity to enroll in one of the Spanish courses that prepare them to be successful on the  exam.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is coordinated by the principal, assistant principals, ENL coordinator and outside consultants  working together to share ideas on effectively planning for teachers,  aligned to the schools coherent set of beliefs and the  Danielson rubric for teaching all with a purpose of meeting the needs of all students. The administration meets once a week to  reflect and refine school-based practices and adjust the professional development plans.  For 2017-2019 the ENL  coordinator will facilitate a series of workshops for ELL teachers. we will meet at least twice a week  during common planning. The first professional development offered by the ELL Coordinator  will be around getting to know  our ELls, “Finding the specific Modality of struggles for our ELls” , “Developing goals and next steps for our ELLs”For all staff  and non-pedagogic staff , the  ENL  coordinator together with the ENL teachers  will facilitate a series of workshops for all  staff.  The focus of the PDs will be "Planning with ELLs in Mind."  "Promoting Conversation Among Students” and .  “Implementing instructional games in the classroom”  Professional development will begin with a self evaluation survey about  how comfortable teachers feel with supporting ELLs in their classrooms.  Participants will then take a deep dive into NYSESLAT  and NYSITELL data where they will become familiar with the new ELL English Proficiency Levels, as well as look for trends in  said data.  This data analysis will lead teachers down a path of inquiry where formative assessments are the catalyst for  informing instruction.  With each subsequent professional development teachers will get a chance to understand the four  language modalities (Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing), with particular emphasis on Writing (lowest performance  modality for our ELLs). . The ESL teacher also consults individually with teachers less familiar with language teaching to guide  the production of appropriate materials and scaffolds for ELLs.The whole-staff PDs described above are partially driven by the  CCLS Language Standards. All teachers at the school must consider how to make vocabulary instruction a continuous focus in  their classrooms to ensure that ELLs have the language tools necessary to both understand input and produce output at a level  appropriate for their grade.4. Hudson High School of Learning Technologies has a dedicated whole-staff PD once weekly for a  total of 1.5 hours. The ESL teacher leads the series of trainings described earlier in this section over the course of the school  year during these sessions.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our 15% of total Hours for all teachers PD is accomplished during our whole-staff PD  conducted once weekly for a total of 2.5  hours. The ELL coordinator and administration meet to determine the amount of  ELL specific Professional development  required for specific ELL training. The 50%  of total hours for ENL teachers meet during twice a week during CPT meeting and  common prep to discuss ELL specific topics. Records of meetings and professional development hours are kept via agendas and  attendance sheets. During the month of  September and October the ENL Coordinator, Mr. Santana will offer the following PDs  to all ENL teachers. During the Second week of September ENL coordinator, Mr, Santana will offer “Finding the specific   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Modality of struggles for our ELls” , “Developing goals and next steps for our ELLs”For all staff and non-pedagogic staff. During  the First week of October we will offer the first ENL PD titled” Getting to Know Our English Language Learners. At the end of  October ENL Coordinator, Mr. Santana and Mr. Hendricks, ENL teacher will offer “ Planning with ELLs in Mind”. During the first  week of November ENL Coordinator, Mr. Santana will offer promotion conversation in the Classroom PD. In December, we will  offer  Implementing instructional games in the classroom. Additionally, all ENL teachers and ENL Coordinator will also  participate in off-site workshops and are required to turn-key this information to their colleagues during PD on Wednesdays  during our whole staff PD and during common planning.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Throughout the course of the year, the ENL teacher schedules appointments with parents in their preferred language to  discuss the  goals of our ENL program, language development progress, language proficiency assessments results, and  language development needs in the content areas.  If parents are not available for in-person conversations, The  ENL teacher  conducts phone  conferences.   Individuals records are placed in binders located at the ELL coordinator's office room 143.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   During the planning stage of the 2017-2019 school year, the school's Parent Environmental Survey are carefully evaluated by  several members of the School Leadership Team.  They identified various areas in which parents expressed concerns and the  team determined that parents needed to be made more aware of certain policies and procedures in our  community.  Workshops are classified in accordance to students' needs.  For example, parents of ELLs are invited to workshops  about resources in the community such as library, immigration services, and community agencies.  In addition, other areas are  being addressed through workshops, planned and organized by the school’s PTA.  Another survey will go out to all parents in  March that will be evaluated and used to plan additional workshops and events for parents in our school.  Parents of ELLs are  invited to PTA meetings as well as three open forums led by the principal intended to learn about parent needs. Translation  services are available at each of these events. Additionally, parents of ELLs are invited to our ENL adult English classes. The  classes are intended to familiarize parents with the ENL staff and school environment while simultaneously providing a service  to support their own language development.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    The ENL program at Hudson High School of Learning Technologies has been developed in response to data which indicates that the  majority of our ELLs have mastered basic communication skills but require further language development to participate at grade  level in academic contexts. With our targeted academic language approach, we were able to improve the proficiency of almost all  students in the 2017-2018 school year. The academic language teaching approaches at Hudson are discussed by the entire staff  and employed in every classroom as we seek to provide ELLs frameworks for developing language in general education  environments. ELLs are able to actively use strategies and vocabulary covered in their ENL course across the content areas where  they learn with non-ELLs and former ELLs in heterogeneous classrooms.                    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nancy Logozzo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Hudson HS of Learning Technolo                                                                              School DBN: 02M437  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
