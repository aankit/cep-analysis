This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school community shares the belief that every child under our care can achieve high academic standards. We will  provide every student with expert and diverse instruction in all content areas. Our focus is on delivering an engaging  and rigorous standards-driven curriculum, based on effective classroom practices supported by up-to-date  technology. Working in partnership with families and community-based organizations, we will ensure all children  develop emotionally, socially, creatively, and intellectually.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 124K is a Title I school located in the South Slope of Park Slope, Brooklyn that serves a linguistically and culturally  diverse community . The student population is very diverse and is comprised of almost 55.8% Latinos, 23% Asians,  13.8% Whites and 3% Blacks. Our students speak Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Mandarin, English, and Polish. We will  serve approximately 340 students in grades Pre-K to 5. Our faculty is diverse and we have an above average number  of male teachers. One of our characteristics is small class size across most grades.       We work hard to foster a life-long love of reading in each and every student. Our school library is an excellent  resource for both students and teachers with an abundance of literature to support our faculty and student readers.  Our science lab supports our curriculum and focuses on inquiry based learning that engage students in hands-on  exploration.

Our students’ education is enhanced through  educational excursions to cultural institutions throughout the city.    We are proud of our advanced achievements in technology. Our teachers and students use our school website to  share lesson plans, videos, and to communicate with other school communities. We are committed to preparing our  students for the technological world they live in and will inherit.    We are committed to growing strong bodies. We have added a school vegetable garden through the generosity of  Lowe’s. Our students have planted and harvested vegetables. Parents participate in monthly workshops where they  learn about the nutritional value of specific vegetables. We will continue to participate in the Cookshop in pre- kindergarten and kindergarten classes.   We are a professional community that works hard to provide the best education possible to our students. Our goal is  to prepare them for their continued educational journey. Our students’ success is our success.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special populations include English language learners, especially in the early childhood grades. These students need  support in oral language development as well as listening, reading and writing instruction. The school is fortunate to  have increased its capacity to support these students by hiring additionally licensed ENL teachers.   Another special population is students with special needs. ICT classrooms exist in kindergarten through grade 4. The  school placed a lot of effort in professional development for teachers in the ICT setting via off-site PD opportunities  and the support of an SE Specialist who worked all year in planning instruction, reviewing IEPs and providing targeted  professional development support.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Framework for Great Schools Focus-Rigorous Instruction: Our special populations include ENL students and Students  with Disabilities. Based on the data from 2017-18 school year, the New York State assessments in ELA have shown an  increase of proficiency in all grades, as well as in the Students with Disabilities subgroup. The data from the 2018 New  York State assessments in mathematics also have shown an increase of proficiency in all grades, as well as in our ELL  and Students with Disabilities subgroups   An area of focus will be in mathematics across all grades. This year teachers will be working within inquiry groups to  analyze student work and assessments in order to identify students' area of need and the current mathematics  curriculum in order to supplement the curriculum to support student achievement.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K124   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   344   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The School Quality Guide demonstrates that the school demonstrates strengths in  its assessment practices and feedback to improve instructional practices.    Analysis of the Learning Environment Survey results reveal that teachers want more supervision of teacher teams and  a clearer vision of expectations for school success.    Strengths:   * Inter-visitations to observe exemplary practices for new and un-tenured teachers,   * Off site professional development in literacy for teachers.    * Professional development sessions in ICT models, practices and planning opportunities on and off-site for new ICT  partnerships.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  Silas B. Dutcher, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for  creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the  school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team,  Parent Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.             Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Silas B. Dutcher will support parents and families of Title I students by:                        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy,  math and use of technology;   providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in  support of the education of their children;   fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their  child’s progress;   providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages that  parents can understand;   providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach,  communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school  community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including  parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation  of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The   Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs  of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent- Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent  Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school  quality, the school will:                  actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program  as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent  Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree upon the use of  these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents to effectively support their child’s  learning.   engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the  school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in  the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent-Teacher  Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development,  especially in developing leadership skills;      maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent  Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children  who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent  Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central  office.;                        conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability grade-level  curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build  parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system,  student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment  Survey Report;   host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of children  participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and  the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening,  to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to  provide suggestions;   translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that  address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent-Teacher Association and Title I  Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; access to  resources on the school's weblog,   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The Community Schools partnership with Counseling in Schools has supported students across all grade levels in  providing after school programming that address artistic expression, physical fitness, social-emotional learning, and  self-discipline. Programming during holidays and weekends has supported academic intervention supports in literacy  and mathematics for students in grades 3-5. Academic intervention before and after school hours has increased the  literacy achievement of students in the early childhood grades. In class push ins have supported the kindergarten  students with exposure to art and academics by aligning with the class curriculum.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    Community Schools initiative will enroll a minimum of 200 students and provide supports via academic intervention,  counseling support groups and enrichment on Saturdays. Students will have programming in cycles that will be  evaluated every 3 months to achieve the goals of providing meaningful services by using a qualitative survey for  student responses as well as the grant guidelines of fulfilling contact hours of 90 by having quarterly check ins.  Quarterly check-ins will ensure that students are accumulating 30 hours by December 2018, 60 hours by March 2019  and 90 hours by June 2019.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  The Community Schools goal will support students in achieving grade level benchmarks through academic  intervention supports and its work on social-emotional learning. Enrichment Clubs in its after school program will  continue to support creative expression, collaboration, and physical fitness. Academic intervention on Saturdays and  in after school programming will support academic achievement for targeted students in grades K-5. Family  engagement will increase by having monthly meetings per grade as well as continuing family workshops on health,  social-emotional learning, academic achievement, and culturally responsive workshops.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.   2.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      3.   4.   Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   1. In order to create a more inclusive environment, the Administrative team will meet with the SLT, and the CSD  regularly to apprise and receive input on initiatives.   2. In collaboration with the CSD and CS Social worker, the Administrative team will use the surveys from all  stakeholders i.e. teachers, students and parents to continue programming that started in its first year in the areas of  after school, Academic and enrichment services, as well as in class push-ins so that all children can benefit.   3. The partnerships that began in the first year will be strengthened by adding a monthly family component by grade.  Community Schools will meet with one grade per month during the family engagement to build a stronger  partnership between parents and teachers.   4. CSD will continue to meet weekly to reflect on program goals and progress and to create better synergy with  teams.         Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 4a.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.

In  particular, this program will help the ELL subgroups to make gains on the Spring 2019  NYSESLAT as well as on the NYS ELA exam.    The supplemental program will target all English Language Learners in kindergarten through  grade five that scored Entering through Commanding on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT  exam.  All of the students targeted performed lower on the writing section of the NYSESLAT  than in any other section on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT.  The direct instruction of this program  will target reading comprehension skills and the content area writing skills.    All cohorts will focus on the following reading comprehension skills: monitoring  comprehension, meta-cognition, answering/asking questions, recognizing text structure,  identifying content vocabulary and summarizing.  The program will focus on teaching the  following writing skills: incorporating content vocabulary, reviewing writing for errors, and  students being able to assess their own work.  Teachers will model skills, provide students with  guided practice and opportunities to apply strategies and skills.     Our program will be offered to our ELL population on Saturdays from 9:00am-12:00pm and will  include an enrichment component in order to provide our students with multiple opportunities to  receive additional services thereby furthering their success.  There will be three cohorts of ELLs  from kindergarten through grade five participating in the Saturday Academy, which will run for  3 hours every Saturday morning from April 2019 through June 2019.  The Saturday program will  run for approximately 8 weeks.  The direct instruction of this program will focus on providing  students with strategies such as close reading strategies, monitoring comprehension,  answering/asking questions, recognizing text structure and teaching and building questioning  skills while answering multiple choice and open ended questions.  Teachers will model  strategies, provide guided practice and offer students multiple opportunities to apply their skills.     Students will utilize the N.Y. T.E.A.M- Teaching ELLs for Academic Language Mastery  program designed to strengthen their reading comprehension skills across the content areas,  while incorporating writing skills.  The program is created as a supplemental English language  development/English as a New Language program for English language learners in grades K-5  with a focus on standards-based instruction through ELA/reading, math, science, and social  studies content.  The program will focus on developing academic language through reading,  writing, listening, and speaking activities necessary for ELLs to be successful in the academic  classroom and on the NYSESLAT.     Our goal for the program is to ensure that our ELLs perform successfully on the N.Y.S ELA,  N.Y.S Math and NYS Science exams.  Students will be provided with bilingual glossaries and  bilingual dictionaries in their native languages.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information     Direct Instruction Supplemental program information:    Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries will be utilized to help students in their native languages in  all Title III classes.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S 124 uses the Fountas and PInnell Assessment System Level ! to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs regardless of grade  level after analysis of the assessment results from the NYSITELL.  Other assessments used to guide instructional planning for  our ELLs includes ELL Baseline Periodic Assessment, Math Periodic Assessment and NYSESLAT.  Analysis of the combination of  these assessments reveal that our beginner ELLs, dependent upon their native language and prior school experience, if any,  have some or no knowledge of letter identification, letter/sound relationships and high frequency word mastery.  The data  helps us to group students for intervention, differentiate small group work in the classroom and identify instructional  resources and strategies for maximum outcomes.     The data patterns on the N.Y.S..E.S.L.A.T. show that students have proficiency in basic interpersonal communication skills  (BICS).  Of the 55 students that were administered the NYSESLAT, 9.1 % scored at the Commanding proficiency level.  Results   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      on the writing and reading subtests of the N..Y.S.E.S.L.A.T. reveal that students need continued support with critical reading  and writing.  The majority of our students in kindergarten are in the entering level while the majority of our students in grades  1-5 are either in the transitioning or expanding stages of English acquisition.    The students tested on the NYSITELL in 2017 are all in the early childhood grades; K-2. The majority of these students need oral  language support, whereas the other students can be grouped to continue oral language support and expand academic  reading and writing skills.    Of the students tested in the NYSITELL this year and Spring 2017 NYSESLAT the majority of students (45) need 2 units of ENL  supoort for the 2017-18 academic year.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Time is allotted for the administration of all assessments formative and curriculum assessments throughout the year.  In the  beginning of the school year, all teachers administer the Fountas and Pinnell Assessement Systems to evaluate the  independent and instructional reading level of all students.  The results of each assessment are then shared with school  leaders to help guide with instructional practices and planning that should take place for ELLs and non ELLs.     Instructional and curriculum planning is also supported by the instructional schedule at our school.  Teachers in all grades are  given common preparatory periods throughout the week.  Colleagues share in common preparatory periods which facilitates  instructional planning as a grade.  In addition to the classroom teachers and school leaders, the ENL provider is also in  attendance during the team meetings.  While such team meetings take place during the school day, team/grade members also  meet on Tuesday afternoons and selected Monday afternoon sessions for inquiry teams.  Inquiry teams are developed based  upon the results from all assessments.  The inquiry teams allows all members to set a structure to ensure student success  through a focus question centered around student need to measure growth over an extended time.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Parents complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and these are reviewed   by the licensed ENL teacher and Spanish bilingual pedagogue, Jeannie Villavicencio.  The first step to the screening is the  completion of the Home Language Questionnaire. Parents are asked all of the questions on the survey in order to determine  the native language of the home. The pedagogue then conducts an oral interview with the child to determine the child's  dominant language.  The questionnaire is reviewed and it is determined if the student’s home language is English or another  language other than English. The ENL teacher, Jeannie Villavicencio who is the designated ENL certified pedagogue in the  school reviews the surveys and assists parents/guardians in the completion of the surveys (orally) with the assistance of  a translator or through the use of Translation and Interpretation services.  An informal oral interview is then conducted in the  Native Language, if Spanish, and English with the parent and the student to determine the dominant language. The student  and the parent are interviewed separately by the ENL teacher. Once it is determined whether the student speaks another  language other than English, the certified ENL teacher proceeds to step two of the process-Initial Assessment. During the Initial  Assessment, the certified ENL teacher administers the NYSITELL, which must be administered within the first ten days of the  student’s enrollment. The student’s score will determine whether or not the certified ENL teacher proceeds to step three  which is informing the parents of the entitlement of bilingual education services. The program placement is determined on the  parent’s program selection and on the level scored which include entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and  commanding levels. Should the students score at a proficient level, the process is stopped and no further determination is  made and a letter stating that services are not needed is sent home via backpack. Should the student score at an emerging,  entering, transitioning, expanding and commanding level, they are entitled to services and the parent/guardian will be  informed through an entitlement letter and a meeting will be conducted at the school to explain all of the programs and  models available to their child. The school uses the results of the NYSITELL to develop instructional programs for English  Language Learners (ELLs).     The New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) is a test developed to measure English   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Language Arts (ELA) proficiency levels of ELLs and is administered each spring. The New York State Department of Education  defines the NYSESLAT proficiency levels as Commanding, Expanding, Transitioning, Emerging and Entering. Depending on the  proficiency level the student acquires, the determination for the appropriate ratio of English to native language use in bilingual  programs, as well as for ESL instruction, is made. The ESL teacher is the designated pedagogue who administers the NYSESLAT.  In order to ensure all students are tested and that all modalities have been administered, the ENL teacher uses the ATS reports  in conjunction with on-going teacher-made lists outlining each student with levels and scores. ATS reports used include RLAT,  RMSR, RHLA, RPOB, RYOS, and REXH, which give detailed information on each student’s exam history, years of service, place of  birth with home language code, and detailed information on each student’s level including raw score on each modality of the  NYSESLAT if taken previously.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Instructional decisions are based upon the assessment results of ELLs in each classroom.  Teacher practices include the use of  technology, differentiating instruction, grouping and scaffolding for our ELLs.  This includes and isn’t limited to lesson plan  consideration on academic language development, content area and academic vocabulary correlation through the use of  picture supports, audiotapes and books on CDs, and ensuring focus on language functions when planning for oral  responses.  In addition, articulation periods during inquiry work time allows the classroom teachers, RtI Specialist and the ENL  teacher to meet to discuss specific TESOL methodologies, preferential seating in the classroom and giving ELLs an allotted wait  time for questions and answer retrieval.  All classroom teachers are provided with a hard copy of the RtI Guide for Teachers of  ELLs.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    When the results of the NYSESLAT are made available to our school in the summer, the ESL teacher uses this data to guide  classroom teachers in areas of strengths as well as areas of weakness.  We use the data for individualized instruction for each  student as it pertains to vocabulary, syntax and grammar.  The patterns revealed from the NYSESLAT (ATS-RLAT)  modalities  will affect instructional decisions.  The results help guide instruction and provide focus areas; currently, students across all  levels are scoring low in reading and writing (RLAT).  Curriculum planning and professional development will incorporate the  use of developing reading comprehension and writing skills because of the need for support in these literacy areas.  AMAO 2 Data- The target for the 2015-16 school year for achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT is 15.6% and for the 2016-17  school year, 16.3%.  PS 124 students have exceeded the target, currently at 20% achievement. 4 students did not make  progress on the NYSESLAT in the 2014-15 school year. 5 students attained proficiency on the NYSESLAT across all home  languages; Arabic, Chinese, Spanish.  This data will be used to calculate the minimum number of students that will ensure  meeting the AMAO target for the current school year and the areas of additional support to ensure growth and achievement.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Paste response to questions here:      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Students in dual language kindergarten and first grade are taught by licensed Bilingual Teachers. Students schedule  are designed in 'A" Week and 'B' Week. A weeks are Spanish mornings and English afternoons. B weeks are English  mornings and Spanish afternoons. All students are taught litearcy and mathematics in both languages. Science is  taught in English and social studies is taught in Spanish.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.                 In the Free Standing ENL Program, the ENL teacher plans instruction and consults with teachers of ELLs to  ensure that lessons incorporate the expectations for the unit of study and the standards for the grade. Instruction in a  HL other than Spanish is not provided. Translation and the teaching of cognates to native Spanish speakers is used to  support comprehension.           In the free-standing ENL program, students at the Entering level of proficiency receive 180 minutes of ENL  services and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA services. Students at the Emerging level of proficiency receive 180  minutes of ENL services and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA services. Students at the Transitioning level of  proficiency receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA. Students at the Expanding level of proficiency receive 180  minutes of integrated ENL/ELA. Students at the Commanding level of proficiency receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA for up to two years after achieving this designation on the NYSESLAT.         In the dual language program grades K and 1, students receive 50% of their instruction in the target language and  50% of instruction in English bi-weekly. Science is taught in English and social studies is taught in Spanish. Each  content area is taught for 150 minutes a week.  Mathematics is taught in both English and Spanish for 250 minutes a  week; A week or B week. ENL is taught daily through small group instruction.        Programming of ELLs required minutes of instruction in ESL is ensured through STARS.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      Dual language classrooms teach science in English and social studies in Spanish. Teachers use the preview/review model  prior to commencing instruction in the target language. Students are given a short preview of the lesson in the dominant  language and then the teacher proceeds with instruction in the target language for content area instruction.          In the free standing ENL model, the ENL teacher uses Total Physical Response techniques, pre-review for students who are  native Spanish speakers, front-loading of key vocabulary and phrases, and visuals for content area instruction The ENL teacher  provides content area support through the use of visuals and realia.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Spanish speakers are assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell Assessment System 1 three times during the school year at the  same time that all other students are assessed for literacy and in preparation for Parent-Teacher Conferences. All other  languages other than English are not assessed due to human capacity.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are assessed in reading comprehension through the Fountas and Pinnell Assessment System three times during the  school year.; September, January, March). ELLs are assessed in listening and speaking through the use of rubrics and checklist  that are created by the ENL teacher and in connection with units of study three times during the school year. Students take  part in the general ELA curriculum which requires that the reading and writing common core learning standards are addressed.  This includes engaging in the writing process and producing writing pieces; informative, narrative and expository. All are  assessed with a standards aligned rubric.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    documentation  documentation  documentation  receipt     The ENL teacher is responsible for initial identification of ELL status upon registration. After receiving a request from the  parent or legal guardian (APPEAL), the re-identification process begins. A review of student work in English and the home  language will be conducted by the principal. The NYSITELL is adminisitered if it was not upon initial identification and if the  written request deems it necessary.  A determination is made by the principal and sent to the parent or legal guardian in the  preferred language. The parent or legal guardian will acknowledge the decision in writing. This portion of the process will be  completed within 10 school days. The principal's determination and the parent's or legal guardian's acknowledgment is sent to  the superintendent or his/her designee for a final decision. In cases where the request is made for a student with an IEP, CSE  will be consulted. The parent or legal guardian will be notified of the superintendent's recommendation in the preferred  language. The parent of legal guardian will acknowledge receipt of the recommendation . All documentation will be  maintained in the student's cumulative folder.        In order to ensure that decisions by the LPT on ELL status has not compromised a student's education, the school report card,  student work and assessment results will be reviewed at the same time that all other students are assessed and in preparation  for Parent-Teacher Conferences, which falls within a three-month window or less when requests are made during the school  year. For requests made after the final PTC in the Spring, a review of student work in preparation for promotion decisions in  May and June will conducted and the process will continue as stated above.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Planning across all grades includes differentiated process and products for ELLs and SWDs in line with their IEP goals. Rubrics  and checklists are a part of this process as well as instructional materials that best support student learning. Some SWDs are  mainstreamed into to the general education classroom in the subjects where they demonstrate the greatest strength and in  consultation with the classroom teachers. Flexible programming for students who are partially mainstreamed is recorded in  SESIS.   The use of native language to support English acquisition is done through access to books in the native language, the  translation of key terms in mathematics on classroom word walls, purposeful partnering of students during small group  instruction to support translation of content and,   The process to place ELLs with disabilities in ICT classes is determined by the placement recommendation on the student's  IEP.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Targeted intervention for ELLs in grades 3-5 include science intervention (1x a week) in English, reading and mathematics  intervention (3x a week) in English. Grade 4 ELLs across all levels of English acquisition receive intervention support in science  by a licensed science teacher. Grade 3 and 5 ELLs receive intervention support in ELA and math by a RtI specialist who targets  students in the lower levels of English acquisition. There are no additional intervention supports for ELLs in social studies. Small  group and differentiated instruction in social studies and all content area is provided by the classroom teacher. Use of the  native language through translated key words in mathematics is used where students are literate in their native language. The  translated words are posted on the math word wall next to the English word. All supports are provided during the school day  in English by a licensed teacher.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The success of the ENL program is measured by the results of the NYSESLAT in the 2014-15 school year and the percentage of  achievement that aligns with the AMAO for the 2014-15 school year targets. In the 2013-14 school year, 61.22% of ELLs  demonstrated progress and 14.29% demonstrated proficiency on the NYSESLAT. In the 2014-15 school year, 7 of 36 ELLs  demonstrated significant progress on the NYSESLAT. Two students tested out at Commanding.      All teachers are made aware of the ELLs in their classrooms through the reorganization of students during clerical days in June  and through a review of the class lists in September with the ENL teacher. Data through the ATS report RELC is reviewed every  time a new admit is registered into the school.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There are no program or service discontinuation at this time.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All students participate in the various school programs through scheduling. There is no distinction between ELLs, GE and SWDs  in offering programs and opportunities, including, but not limited to, the free YMCA After School Program and the guitar and  visual arts enrichment programs after school hours. Students participate by attending on a regular basis. All programs take  attendance daily to ensure full participation.   The Title III ESL After School Program will be the only supplemental program available to ELLs during the 2015-16 school  year.  There are no other supplemental programs being offered during after school hours.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Instructional materials used for ELLs include guided reading books, wordless picture books, manipulatives in mathematics and  themed picture cards in ELA, social studies and science, and Starfall on the internet for Emergent and Newcomer groups.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In the dual language program, Spanish is supported through the use of Spanish language books sent home alongside English  language books in the book baggie. Families participate in Parents as Reading Partners once a month in grades Pre-K 2 and use  this time to support the native language by reading to children and having children read to them. The dual language program  supports home language through a leveled Spanish language library and rich literature selections that students take home to  have parents read to them. The classrooms also display a Spanish language word wall that contains the words students are  learning and have learned. In the ENL program, parents also participate in Parents as Reading Partners once a month.  Classrooms include baskets with literature in the native language. Wherever appropriate, connections to vocabulary in the  native language is displayed in the native language alongside the English word to support comprehension.  Currently, there is no Transitional Bilingual Program.  The ENL program supports the native language through the inclusion of native language books and through the math word  wall. Notices to families go home in the preferred language and interpretation services are utilized through the NYC DoE.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Services to students is determined by the results of the NYSESLAT and its modality breakdown. Students are grouped according  to ability in grade bands. Resources are allocated according to student need, performance on the NYSESLAT and feedback from  the classroom and ENL teacher. Classroom teachers are provided with instructional resources to support literacy learning, such  as themed picture supports, leveled books and themed titles to support content area learning.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Orientation for new families is conducted before school begins for families of students entering grades Kindergarten and Pre-K.  Print material is translated and an interpreter available. This orientation is led by the principal, parent coordinator and  members of the PTA. Information shared include extra-curricular activities, safety, special services for students who are ELLs or  students with disabilities, contact information for key school staff, such as Speech Therapist, Guidance Counselor, School  Psychologist, School Nurse, Secretary.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    In the dual language program, Spanish is supported through the use of Spanish language books sent home alongside English  language books in the book baggie. Families participate in Parents as Reading Partners once a month in grades Pre-K 2 and use  this time to support the native language by reading to children and having children read to them. The dual language program  supports home language through a leveled Spanish language library and rich literature selections that students take home to  have parents read to them. The classrooms also display a Spanish language word wall that contains the words students are  learning and have learned. In the ENL program, parents also participate in Parents as Reading Partners once a month.  Classrooms include baskets with literature in the native language.

Currently, there is no Transitional Bilingual Program.  The ENL program supports the native language through the inclusion of native language books and through the math word  wall. Notices to families go home in the preferred language and interpretation services are utilized through the NYC DoE.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   There are no language electives.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The Spanish Dual Language Program consists of two classes; one kindergarten and one first grade. The model is self-contained  taught by a licensed Spanish bilingual teacher. The aim is to have 50% of students who are English dominant (non-ELLs) and  50% English language learners. The current configuration does not meet this goal. The kindergarten percentage of ELLs is 16%.  The percentage of ELLS in first grade is 0%, all students having tested out in their kindergarten year.  Literacy and mathematics are taught both in English and Spanish. Science is taught in English and social studies is taught in  Spanish. Students get some of their music instruction in Spanish, learning songs, and movement games from different Latin  American countries.  The languages are separated for instruction using a A and B Week model. A weeks are Spanish mornings/English afternoons  and B weeks are English mornings/Spanish afternoons. In as much as possible, the program attempts to ensure that the day is  50% English and50% Spanish. Print is color-coded in the classroom; blue or black for English and red for Spanish, and  instructional materials are labeled accordingly side - by - side. A sign outside the classroom door alerts guests and staff on the  language of instruction taking place.   Emergent literacy is taught to all of the students in both languages, simultaneously, and teachers use Estrellita, a Spanish  phonics literacy program, for all students.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   All teachers; early childhood, common branch, science specialist, visual arts and music teacher, RtI  specialist, paraprofessionals, and ENL teacher, will participate in 7.5 hours or more of ELL professional  development that focuses on teaching practice and assessment. Teachers will learn about the new CR   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Part-154 regulations and their role in supporting ELLs.

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers, including teachers who serve ELL students, will participate in 7.5 hours of ELL professional development that focus  on teaching practice and assessment. Teachers of ELLs will also participate in professional development that focuses on  planning instruction that uses the NYS Bilingual Common Core Initiative document and the new language arts progressions.    Families of all students transitioning into middle school are offered a workshop led by LIU in May specifically designed to  provide information on adolescence in middle school and the social-emotional impact of transition to middle school. This  workshop is provided by a bilingual presenter and additional interpreters, if needed.   The guidance counselor is a new hire to the NYC DoE  as of November 2015 and has not received professional development, as  yet, on supporting ELLs as they transition. The guidance counselor will participate in PD offerings provided by the BFSC  throughout the school year, conduct a parent survey to identify needs and network with other counselors in the district to plan  joint activities in support of ELLs and their families.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    All teachers, including teachers who serve ELL students, will participate in ELL professional development that focuses on  teaching practice and assessment. There will be 34 Monday PD Days in the current school year. 15% of that number is the  equivalent of 6 sessions. Each Monday PD session is 1hour and 20  minutes. Teachers will participate in 7 hours and 20 minutes  of PD or more during the school year to meet the mandated 15% professional development time. In addition, ENL teachers will  participate in off-site PD offered by the Department of English Language Learners and the Borough Field Support Center- Brooklyn North.   We ensure that we meet with the professional development requirements by maintaining a copy of attendance, agendas and  handouts for every professional development session offered at the school level and a record of off-site PD of the same that  teachers must submit the day after they return from off-site PD. A PD table with the record of hours met for each PD session is  used to track the mandated PD hours. Attendance and Sign-In Sheets are kept on file for all school PD events.   The school provides annual meetings with parents of ELLs on Tuesday Parent Engagement time or a preparation period that is  calendared for each family and with the classroom teacher and ENL teacher. The ENL teacher will keep track of every family  that has participated in the mandated annual meeting. Academic achievement is reviewed through assessment results in all  academic areas and supports for continued improvement offered.   The ENL teacher, who is bilingual-Spanish, and some classroom teachers who are already bilingual-Spanish, are able to conduct   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         the meeting for Spanish dominant families. Our school has three Arabic staff members who provide interpretation for Arabic  families and Mandarin and Cantonese families are provided interpretation through the Translation an Interpretation Unit of  the DoE.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Meeting notes and all other documents related to annual meetings with families of ELLs are kept by the ENL teacher and hard  copies of the same by the classroom teacher in the student's cumulative folder. Out reach to parents of ELLs via phone is  recorded in a log by the ENL teacher and classroom teachers separately. Copies of letters sent home via backpack or by mail  are maintained by the ENL teacher as the author and the classroom teacher as the author. Documents are translated into the  preferred language by qualified staff at the school level for Spanish and Arabic and by the NYC DoE Translation and  Interpretation Unit for Chinese.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent Involvement include Parents as Reading and Math Partners, scheduled meetings throughout the school year during  Parent Engagement Tuesdays to review student achievement and workshops to provide strategies for supporting learning at  home. In addition, parents are involved in planning cultural celebrations, such as Cinco de Mayo and Chinese New Year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Annabell Burrell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Silas B.
