This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   OUR MISSION   Section 4: CEP Overview      At PS 17 our mission is to create literate, innovative and proficient scholars who are able to participate in rich,  academic learning in a nurturing environment where all children RISE, as determined by the Next Generation Learning  Standards.

We believe that:         Students will have the opportunity to apply and express their learning in diverse ways and for a variety of  audiences.  Students will have the opportunity to develop academic language in a variety of ways:    o  Writing across the content areas  o  Speaking and listening protocols  o  Use of different cooperative learning formats  o  Use of different forms of technology       Students will have the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary activities using a range of genres and  multiple texts to apply competency skills to convey meaning.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   A review of both the 2018 June Instructional Reports and June 2018 reading level data indicate the following areas of  focus:     There is a significant gap in the ELA achievement of 3rd graders identified as ENL students. This trend  occurred in both the multiple choice and written response categories. There also continues to exist a  significant gap in the percentage of ENL students reading at or above grade level. This gap in ELA achievement  is not evident in the 4th or 5th grades. Therefore, there is a need to address both the teaching and learning of  the 2018-2019 3rd graders, as well as target ELA support for 4th graders who are ENL students.     Across all testing grades there is a need to target math support for students with disabilities. There is a   performance gap with 3rd grade students in the ICT class, as compared to other settings. In addition, there is  a need to target support to students in self-contained settings.   Specific major areas of focus for this subgroup include:   1.  Grade 3: Number Sense & Operations in Base Ten  2.  Grade 4: Number & Operations in both Base Ten & Fractions  3.  Grade 5: Number & Operations in both Base Ten & Fractions         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   DATA REVIEW   Progress Points     The percentage of 4th graders scoring at or above grade level in science rose by 15%, resulting in 91% of 4th   grade scoring a 3 or a 4, and no students scoring a 1     10% more students met standard promotional criteria in ELA, as compared to results form June 2017    According the June 2018 ELA Instructional Report:   1.  Grade 4 reduced the overall gap between the school and the city by 7%    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      2.  Grade 5 outperformed the city overall by 1% point, and by 7% in writing to sources    Key Areas of Focus     The % of students meeting standard promotional criteria in math remained the same from June 2017 to June   2018     According to the most recent data from the learning survey:   1.  39% of teachers say that students build on each other's ideas during class discussion.  2.  38% of teachers say that students use data or text references to support their ideas.   3.  79% of teachers say that students participate in class discussions at some point.   A review of the above data and information from teacher's unit plans, walkthroughs connected to focus units and  Advance observations indicates a need to address opportunities for embedding rich questioning and discussion  techniques across content areas.     According the June 2018 Math Instructional Report:   1.

A review of both the 2018 June Instructional Reports and June 2018 reading level data indicate the following areas of  focus:     There is a significant gap in the ELA achievement of 3rd graders identified as ENL students. This trend  occurred in both the multiple choice and written response categories. There also continues to exist a  significant gap in the percentage of ENL students reading at or above grade level. This gap in ELA achievement  is not evident in the 4th or 5th grades. Therefore, there is a need to address both the teaching and learning of  the 2018-2019 3rd graders, as well as target ELA support for 4th graders who are ENL students.     Across all testing grades there is a need to target math support for students with disabilities. There is a   performance gap with 3rd grade students in the ICT class, as compared to other settings. In addition, there is  a need to target support to students in self-contained settings.   Specific major areas of focus for this subgroup include:   1.  Grade 3: Number Sense & Operations in Base Ten  2.  Grade 4: Number & Operations in both Base Ten & Fractions  3.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 17, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 17 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

We have found that  attendance is higher while better servicing more students who are in need of language support if  it is done on a Saturday.    The supplemental instruction will be administered by a total of 4 certified ENL and/or Content- Specific teachers, that provide instruction to ENL students in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5. Our selection  criteria for the teachers of this program includes: 1)  A minimum of one year satisfactory  teaching experience, as well as satisfactory ratings required in all previous  assignments  2)  Demonstrates familiarity with the Next Generation Learning  Standards  3)Demonstrates familiarity with best practices for ENL students 4) Certification in  TESOL or bilingual extension  This program will begin in December and end in May. We will notify all ELL parents/guardians  if their child is eligible to participate in the Title III Saturday Academy Program in the parents  preferred home language.  Copies of these letters will be distributed and maintained by the ENL  Coordinator.   Data from the NYSESLAT from the previous year will be used to select students  for extra support.  Delivery of instruction will be in English only. The program  will run from  9:00am to 12:00 pm every Saturday, between the allowed dates and excluding  holidays/vacations.   The supplemental help will focus on ENL grade level standards that are  aligned with Next Generation Learning Standards, specifically in the four modalities of the  English language which are Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing as well as the New  Language Arts Progressions and Home Language Arts Progressions. Using ENL strategies, skills  and methodologies, our teachers, will provide rigorous instruction and activities to promote  English language proficiency.    Attendance will be taken by the individual teachers and copies  will be maintained by the ENL Coordinator.  The parents will be invited to workshops to support  their child by introducing them to the instructional strategies being used in the program.    The materials we use will focus on reading and vocabulary skills that are required to master the  Next Generation Learning Standards, the New Language Arts Progressions and Home Language  Arts Progressions. Through this program, our goal expectations are that  students achieve a  higher or proficiency level on the NYSESLAT exam.   Students will be exposed to texts that are detailed and rich in vocabulary.  This will support oral  language development and allow for students to have accountable talk and social interactions.  Through these texts, we will foster group work while differentiating instruction. Other skills that  will be reinforced include, author's purpose, drawing conclusions, figurative language, inference,  main idea, prior knowledge, prediction, problem solving, sequence, word meaning, fact/detail,  moral/lesson and picture/word I.D.  This will help students develop English comprehension and  fluency of oral language and reading skills. Basic and higher order thinking skills are  incorporated into each lesson and vocabulary and language development are an inherent part of  this program.  Another aspect of the program includes the purchase and implementation of the Getting Ready  for the NYSESLAT books for grades 2-5.  These books are supplemental and distinct from those  used in daily instruction. These materials are separate grade level instructional books that will be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   used to provide maximum practice for this exam.  These comprehensible instructional guides  include activities in all performance developments for students on levels that include Entering,  Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding.  Students will be able to practice Speaking, Listening,  Reading and Writing skills through broad based content themes.  Students will use individual  student progress charts to track their achievement.   These books reflect the format, content and  item type of questions on the NYSESLAT exams.  This will allow students to be fully prepared  to score higher or proficiency level on the NYSESLAT exam.

Through these professional  developments they will design instructional programs to develop skills in listening, reading,  writing, and speaking in English.   Lessons will integrate academic literacy content appropriate  for students age, grade level and English language skills. Some professional development will  better prepare and train teachers on the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Interventions.  Teachers will become familiar in research-based early interventions that can prevent literacy  difficulties before they turn into long-term challenges.  Professional support includes, one day of  training and one follow-up day to give teachers an in-depth understanding of the resources that  will be used to support the program. Professional support will also include the implementation of  vocabulary words to help improve comprehension through direct instruction and/or words in  context, understanding the demands of a text by re-visting it for increased understanding and  clarification as well as assessing and grouping students.  These professional supports help deepen  an understanding of many research-based techniques to help struggling readers make accelerated  progress.    Other professional development sessions will serve as planning and preparation time in order to  familiarize the staff on how to successfully implement the program to the targeted students.  The  teachers will also share best practices and be provided with opportunities to work together to  determine how to integrate these strategies into successful instructional supports within the  program . We will use the expertise of our ENL Coordinator, Joanna Antoniou Tetro who will  serve as the staff developer to familiarize the teachers with the books and resources, as well as  the implications for instruction so that the program is delivered by professionals who have been  properly trained.    The ENL/Dual Language department will meet 3 times a year (beginning, middle and end) to  identify instructional issues that will be used as our Problem of Practice.  We will look at data  from the NYSESLAT exam (both qualitative and quantitative) and discuss what we can do  differently as professionals to ensure that we have the most powerful effect on what our student  do and the quality of the work they are producing.   The teachers and/or ENL coordinator will attend outside professional development where they  will develop tool kits of methods to support ELLs in becoming stronger readers and  writers.  This information will be shared with the rest of the staff during meetings.   During these  meetings, teachers will also focus on student data and how to interpret it to drive instruction that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part C: Professional Development   helps to meet the needs of our English Language Learners.  NYSESLAT scores will be analyzed  to determine what skills are needed to address on an individual basis; these scores and data will  drive our differentiated instruction within the program.

These exams students will be preparing for  are: the ELA and/or NYSESLAT exams.  These workshops will be offered during the school day  and in the evenings for parents/guardians who work (specific dates and times to be  announced).  Parents/Guardians will be notified of these meetings through fliers, PTA meetings,  follow-up phone calls and our social media Facebook and Instagram pages. These types of  workshops will incorporate resources such as bilingual glossaries in different content areas such  as ELA, Science, Social Studies and Math.  We will have interpretation services available for  parents/guardians who may need it.  In addition to these workshops, the parents/guardians are  invited to the Annual Citywide ELL Conference.  These workshop will be facilitated by the ENL  coordinator, Language Access Coordinator, administrators and/or outside support groups such as  community based organizations.  Our Parent Coordinator, Dina Pilios, will have a critical role in our parent/community  involvement for ELLS. She is also serving as the Language Access Coordinator of PS  17Q.  Throughout the school year, she will invite community based organizations (CBOs), to  conduct workshops for ELL parents/guardians. This will provide them with information about  the various opportunities that are afforded to them.  Parents/guardians will be invited to attend  field trips to the library, colleges and museums while learning to read, write, speak, and  understand the English language to become a better resource for their  children.  Parents/guardians will also participate in an on-site workshop led by ENL Support  Staff called, “How to Prepare Your Child for the NYSESLAT”. The Parent Coordinator will  continue to provide and conduct enriching activities for families at PS 17Q and at various  cultural and scholarly institutions within the community.  The  goal of this initiative is to  strengthen the achievement of ELLS through parental involvement and empowerment and to  further empower parents by informing them of how to utilize language translation/interpretation  and 311 services available to them.  Culture Night is an annual event that helps explore the various cultures that make up our school  community. This event is held in the Spring and is hosted by parents and teachers.  Everyone  comes together as a community of diverse cultures to share through the generations a continued  experience and understanding of what it means to be human.  Celebrating the schools  cultural diversity brings our learning community together while providing an opportunity to  celebrate the richness and benefits we get from being such a diverse community.  One of the  greatest reasons for all of us to organize this celebration at our school is the opportunity it offers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    students, teachers and families to encounter one another in celebration while strengthening the  academic connections to students prior knowledge and background experiences.  The Dual Language (DL) program will host 3 annual events  that help bring families together to  unite and build the dual language community.  The Winter Mixer gives a chance for students and  teachers to interact and develop a bond outside of the classroom.  The Spring Picnic allows  future parents/students of the program to interact with current parents/students of the program.  It  allows new parents to feel warm and welcomed into the DL community as well as gives an  insight to the expectations, activities and parental involvement that takes place within the  program.  The third event changes on a yearly basis.  This year the DL department will host "The  Mariachi".  Students put on a performance highlighting one aspects of the  Hispanic community.  There will be food and drinks to share that represent the variety of  countries that "The Mariachi" represents.  This provides a cultural authentic experience to the  parents and students that reinforces what the program stands for and the variety of cultures with  in the Hispanic community.  It also allows native English speakers a chance to  immerse themselves into an authentic Hispanic experience.       Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessment Tools:   NYSITELL  NYSESLAT scores (K-5)  English and Spanish assessments TCRWP reading assessments   TCRWP High Frequency Words assessments  ESTRELLITA  Fountas & Pinnell Spanish reading assessments  ELL Periodic Assessments      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      A review of both Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)  data and reading level data indicate there is about a 29% gap in reading  levels between English Language Learners and native English speakers. Our ELL population was 35 points away from making  AYP in ELA and 25 points away from making AYP in Math.  The data from these assessments provides teachers with insight to  appropriate grouping for these students, as well as reading level behaviors to target within instruction. We use Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP)  Assessment Pro to collect our English Language Arts (ELA) assessment data. This  program allows us to filter our ELL and Former ELL students' results. We can view the percentage of students who fall below,  or are approaching the standards, as well as monitor student progress. We can then identify the individual students' needs and  plan for leveled instruction, at- risk targeted instruction, or potential movement to Tier II Response To Intervention  (RTI) instruction. We can identify the individual students who need targeted instruction to support moving these students to  meeting the standard levels within 2 benchmark periods. Students who do not progress to meeting the standard levels are  further evaluated for additional interventions. These interventions include: Fundations (K-2); Great Leaps (K-5); Guided  Reading (K-5), ESTRELLITA (K-1); S.P.I.R.E (Specialized Program Individualizing Reading Excellence), and the Sadlier Vocabulary  program.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers and Paraprofessionals have been trained on all the different types of intervention programs we offer and have been  implementing them with targeted students.  Progress monitoring is done on an ongoing basis to make sure the targeted  instruction is helping students meet the standards.  Teachers have been attending professional development meetings at  Teachers College to help and support our ELL population.  Dual Language and ENL teachers meet monthly to discuss trends  they see across grades and adjust units of study accordingly.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We have adjusted our evaluation process based on not meeting AYP and reading achievement data. Reading data is formally  collected 5 times a year through Teachers College Running Records. Students that are identified at risk will receive either  Guided Reading, Fundations, Great Leaps instruction, S.P.I.R.E or the Sadlier Vocabulary program.  Students in grades 3-5 will  be taking Schoolnet assessments 4 different times through-out the year to assess how well they are performing in reading and  math.  Our ELL population will be taking the beginning and end of year ELL Periodic Assessments and well as our dual language  students will be taking the Spanish HLA Periodic Assessment beginning and end of year exam.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There will be ongoing progress monitoring that will take place every 6 to 8 weeks to monitor student growth.    We will look at how students  have performed on Schoolnet assessments to see trends across grades.  We will meet with  teacher teams to address these trends and modify instruction to address the needs of our students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Classroom teachers are currently using the assessments described and listed in question #1, teacher created assessments as  well as informal observations to determine the levels of their students. Teachers then provide Tier I instruction, taking detailed  conference notes and monitoring the progress of their students for 8-10 weeks. After providing students with Tier I whole  group instruction in the classroom, if students show weakness in a specific skill or area, these conference notes, assessments  and informal observations are used to inform instruction on a Tier II level. These Tier II interventions are coupled with  instructional routines that are research-based and appropriate for linguistically diverse learners.  If students are not making  any progress, the data is reviewed by the Pupil Personnel Academic Intervention/RTI team. The team supports teachers in  making instructional decisions as well as helps to determine a student's appropriate movement to a Tier III level.  A member of  this team will visit the classroom to conduct an observation, as well as collect and review additional data to ensure consistency  between what was reported and what is actually happening.  Based on the above process, the team will either  a) recommend that a child moves to another Tier  b) schedule professional development and/or coaching sessions with a team  member and the teacher  c) request that the teacher implement certain interventions within the classroom.  The student is  monitored closely by the classroom teacher and the team to see if anything further needs to be implemented.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   When looking at student results on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, we have found that ELL students in grades 1-5 perform better  during the listening and speaking section of the exam rather than in the reading and writing section.  We use this information  to help inform our planning of units and lessons. Our goal is to use this evidence to create good instructional practices within  these ENL classrooms.  Teachers make sure that lesson and unit plans reflect knowledge of ENL pedagogy, including  home language support whenever possible. Within our ENL/Dual Language classes, teachers are planning purposefully explicit  and implicit vocabulary and language instruction to build students academic language.  Students are allowed to interact with  texts in a variety of ways as well as using interactive reading approaches. This support also continues in the after school  program. The instructional goal remains the same and teachers collaborate together in planning effective strategies that will  help ELLS continue making successful gains.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to achieve continuous growth we constantly adjust our instruction to meet the needs of our students.  Administrators  and/or the ENL Coordinator meets with teachers individually and in teacher teams to discuss findings and expected outcomes  for these students. They articulate areas in need of improvement and this becomes the focus when teachers meet together to  discuss improvements in either the delivery of lessons or the content within the lessons. Teachers develop an action plan by  using the results from the assessments that students have taken and combine it with current research based strategies for  their ELL students to aid in the progress towards the language and content objectives.  Teachers are also asked to attend  professional development meetings to help them with best practices for teaching ELLS.  Teachers are asked to turn key the  information they have learned and share any new ideas, strategies, visuals, and materials they have obtained from attending  these meetings.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,  emphasizing English language acquisition. As per CR Part 154, there are 2 types of ENL programs offered at PS 17 Q:  •     Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content  courses. It is delivered by certified ENL teachers in our building.  A student does not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of  core content area instruction. ELLs are grouped together in an ENL class, for the entire school day and for all content  instruction. Heterogeneous grouping occurs in Stand-alone or Self Contained classes.  •     Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a  dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co- teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content  area teacher. Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language  development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status receive a minimum  number of units of integrated ENL.  The ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration with general education  classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is a common preparation time  between the 2 teachers and/or prior collaborative lesson planning. Integrated teaching occurs with the Least  Restrictive Environment as possible.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59        The ENL Coordinator Joanna Antoniou Tetro provides targeted ENL instruction to different groups of students with  the same English proficiency levels.  She plans carefully with the general education teachers to ensure curricular  alignment and continuity of instruction.  The integrated ENL along with a subject area are taught dependent upon the  student’s proficiency level in grades K to 5.  At the entering, emerging and transitioning levels, integrated ENL with  ELA is provided; at the expanding level,  integrated ENL is combined with any content area that best meets the needs  of the student.  In grades PRE-K to 4, certified bilingual common branch teachers are permitted to provide the ENL  component of a bilingual program.  These teachers hold the bilingual certification needed to teach in a bilingual  program.  Mrs. Antoniou Tetro also goes into the classroom to support ELLs during content area lessons to provide  language acquisition and vocabulary support.  She may be supporting ELLs during a mini lesson next to her  student(s)  while the general/special education teacher is teaching.  She may wait until instruction is completed and  then work with ELL students in a small group.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The vision of the Dual Language Program at P.S. 17 Q is to empower students to become lifelong learners who are  bilingual, bicultural, and bi-literate.  They will grow into confident role models who will embrace diversity and invoke  a positive change in our global society.      This program promotes bilingualism and biliteracy, grade level academic achievement and cross cultural competence  in all students. The main goal of our Dual Language Program is that our students develop a high academic and  linguistic proficiency in two languages.  Dual language students participate in a rigorous academic program that  nurtures the development of bilingualism, biculturalism, and biliteracy so that students will graduate ready for  college, career, and life in a globally competitive economy. This instruction is given by certified bilingual teachers.    We use a Two-Way Dual Language model at our school which means that two language groups of students will be  joined in the same class to become bilingual, bicultural, and biliterate. Our dual language classes are composed of an  equal number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students who are learning in both languages.  The language  of instruction is alternated daily by the teacher.  This is called a "50/50 Roller Coaster Model."         The Dual Language program is offered to all students who are entitled to ENL services and English proficient students  in grades Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade and 4th grade who wish to learn Spanish as  a second language. Some of our students speak additional languages at home.  Since they already have a pre-existing  foundation for learning a second language, these students often do very well in the dual language classroom.  Having  your child learn a third or fourth language at this early age will only add to their benefits in the long term.  Stand  alone and integrated models are both implemented in the Dual Language programs depending on the needs of the  students.  There is one teacher who provides instruction in both languages.  However, when each language is used in  the instructional day is predetermined by the delivery model.  The classrooms have instructional materials in both  languages to support the program and is organized so that the language of instruction is clearly designated by color  codes.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Before students begin the school year, they are placed in their new classes according to NYSESLAT scores.  Students who are  current ELLs are placed in self contained ENL classrooms that are taught by certified ENL teachers.  Dual language students are  placed in bilingual classrooms that are taught by certified bilingual teachers.  Special Education English Language Learners are  placed (according to their Individualized Education Plan- IEP) either in an ICT classroom that has a  special education teacher and an ENL teacher (if the teacher doesn't hold and ENL license the students get services by the ENL  coordinator either through push-in or pull-out model) or are in a Self Contained special education classrooms that has one  special education teacher and receive their ENL services by the ENL coordinator either through the push-in or pull-out  model.  Students who are at the commanding level still receive ENL services for 2 years after they have tested out.  These  students are placed in an ENL self contained classroom until the 2 years pass and accommodations are completed.  At times,  there are students who  test out of ENL and are not placed in an ENL self contained classroom.  These students then  are flex scheduled into and ENL classroom for 90 minutes a week.      The breakdown of the program is as follows:  •       Entering level students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction.   180 of those minutes are integrated ENL/ELA and 180 of  those minutes are stand alone.  •      Emerging level students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction.    180 of those minutes are integrated ENL/ELA and 90 of  those minutes are standalone.  The remainder of those 90 minutes is flexible in either stand alone or integrated minutes.    •      Transitioning level students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction. 90 of those minutes are integrated ENL/ELA and the  other 90 of those minutes are flexible in either stand alone or integrated minutes.  •      Expanding level students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  All 180 of those minutes is integrated ENL/ELA or other  content area instruction.   •      Commanding level students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction.  All 90 of those minutes are in integrated ENL/ELA or  other content area instruction.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In Grades K-5, focus will be placed on modifying Teachers College Reading/Writing Workshops to meet the needs of our  English Language Learners. Instruction is fully aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards, the New Language Arts  Progressions and Home Language Arts Progressions. Teachers will use conference notes and data from these units of study to  support student achievement and differentiate instruction.  All instruction is consistent with CR Part 154 requirements.    Many of the programs we provide at PS 17 Q make the content we teacher comprehensible to foster language development.  • The Sadlier vocabulary program and online interactive version will be used to help ELLS close the achievement gap between  themselves and non ELLS in ELA.  This program  will help them expand their vocabulary while learning how to use these words  to express their own ideas.  There is a heavy emphasis on vocabulary to be used across the curriculum from reading/writing to  social studies, science and math.    • Teachers College and Fountas and Pinnell running records are also used to measure student level growth in English and  Spanish.  This helps with guided reading groups as well as small group instruction.   • Teachers College reading and writing units of study in Grades K-5 supports teachers of students who are learning English as  a new language by showing them how to adapt the program to make it more beneficial for ELLS.    They suggest important  revisions to make particular units more helpful for ELLS by giving them more time to talk, read and write.

Students with more proficiency need help to learn academic English vocabulary, pronouns and verb tenses while  newcomers need to work on participating in social language while building on their prior knowledge.  There is a big emphasis  on labeling and vocabulary development.   • The math program GO Math! provides activities designed to help children acquire math vocabulary and the language as well  as writing skills necessary to communicate and understand math concepts.  It offers a visual approach to teaching content  skills, key concepts and academic language.  It is a standards based curriculum that helps build language and communication  skills.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Our school uses Fountas and Pinnell for Spanish language assessment collection and reviews the data to address the needs of  our ELL students. Home language support is systemic, but not limited to the ENL classroom. In addition, to glossaries,  dictionaries, and materials in the home languages represented by the ELL population, we have highly qualified school  personnel who are able to provide support to students during the school day.  They are utilized to provide clarification for ELLS  (in their home languages), especially to those who may be struggling with content and concepts in the content areas. Teachers  group students of the same language for certain activities so that they can assist each other and respond in their home  language.                5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. In the event that a SIFE student is admitted to P.S. 17, we have a plan in place to best serve this population. These students  will initially be placed with beginner ELLS in grade appropriate classes and receive intervention services from an ENL teacher  for a total of 360 minutes per week for six to eight weeks. This instruction will be differentiated based on the proficiency level  of the student and formal as well as informal assessments. Upon further assessment, these students will be placed into a  grade appropriate setting according to their individual needs. They will receive "Response to Intervention" (RTI) small group  instruction daily each morning for a duration of approximately 30 minutes for extra support.     b. Plan for ELLS in school less than 3 years/ Newcomers:  Instruction will be focused on Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS). Total Physical Response (TPR) will be  incorporated into all instruction to ensure that students comprehend all information presented. Academic language will be  incorporated into grade level instruction, but will be limited to basic concept words until students acquire additional language.  Instruction will remain uniformed according to content, but will incorporate various ENL strategies such as the use of realia,  visual aids, repetition and graphic organizers. Students will be placed in classes with more advanced ELLS or native English  speakers in order to promote oral fluency. Classrooms will be equipped with a Literacy program which integrates interactive  technology and print to accelerate reading and language skills based on individual student levels. In addition to ENL services,  students will be offered AIS, and Title III supplemental program instruction.     c. Plan for ELLS in school 4-6 years:  Instruction will be academically rigorous and will focus on Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency Skills (CALPS). These  students have already acquired social English skills, but academic skills are limited. They need various ENL methodologies and  techniques to improve in all content areas. This instruction will be on grade level, but will be intensive and vocabulary rich.  Small group instruction will be a key part of advancing listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills. Teachers run the RLAT  report from ATS to group students according to ability in each combined modality and as a result, meet the specific needs of  each student. Classrooms will be equipped with a Literacy Program which integrates interactive technology and print to  accelerate reading and language skills based on individual student levels and understanding.  In addition to ENL services,  students will be offered AIS, RTI and Title III program instruction.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62        d. Plan for ELLS in school 6 years completed or more / Long Term ELLS   Instruction will focus on repetition and small group intervention. There will be continual formal and informal assessments  aligned with instruction in order to determine individually appropriate focus skills. Instruction for these students will be highly  structured and predictable. Classrooms will be equipped with a Literacy Program which integrates interactive technology and  print to accelerate reading and language skills based on individual student levels. In addition to ENL services, students will be  offered AIS, RTI and Title III program instruction.     e. Plan for former ELLS  Transitional Student Support Plan (ELLS that pass NYSESLAT are transitional students for 2 years) P.S. 17's plan for supporting  the students who passed the NYSESLAT is as follows:  All former ELLS, who have passed the NYSESLAT exam, will continue to get support services for up to two years. For two years  following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLS receive at least one half of one unit of study  of English as a new language (90 minutes per week) and are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations. Former ELLS  receive time and a half (extended time) testing accomodations for up to two years after testing out of the NYSESLAT. These  students are also invited to participate and attend the Title III after-school program for additional support. In addition, most of  these students are placed in ENL self-contained classes or are in a class that receives ENL services by an ENL service provider,  therefore, services for transitional students are not discontinued.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Plan for ELL Special Needs Students:    Special Education English Language Learner students participate in all aspects of school activities such as art, computers,  music, physical education, theater, school plays/performances and field trips. Instruction for these students will be predictable  and highly structured routines will be in place. The ENL teachers initially analyze the IEPs and NYSESLAT scores of all their  students. If the student is not in an ENL self-contained classroom, then the ENL service provider collaborates with the  classroom teacher when appropriate, to co-teach with the classroom teacher. Co-teaching ensures that the ENL program  provided for these students is in the least restrictive environment. When co-teaching is not available, students are pulled out  of their class and are placed in a group with other ELLS either on the same grade level or one grade above or below level.  Lessons use multi-sensory strategies in order to meet the needs of all learners. Hands-on activities are incorporated into  content area lessons whenever possible. The language is simplified accordingly during each lesson but content remains on  grade level. Main ideas are reinforced through rephrasing, verbatim repetition, and students will play an active role in their  own learning. Classrooms will be equipped with a Literacy Program which integrates interactive technology and print to  accelerate reading and language skills based on individual student levels and the bilingual Spanish/English Understanding  Mathematics Technology-based Mathematics Program. In addition to ENL services, students will be offered AIS, RTI, and Title  III after school program instruction.     Intervention Programs for ELLS (AIS) are provided for Level 1 and Level 2 students in Grades K-5. Students can also be referred  for AIS by their classroom teacher. In Grades K-5, students are serviced for ten weeks by a qualified provider using a pull-out  model. Students are seen 3-5 days per week, depending on the availability of the provider and the needs of the students.  Depending on each individual situation, students may be invited to continue services after the ten weeks.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In adherence to the Special Education Reform, our classes use flexible scheduling to provide the least restrictive environment  to our ELL-SWD population. Students can have the flexibility to move to the appropriate class where instruction is taking place,  on their level. For example, most of our classes on the same grade have their ELA and Math block scheduled at the same time  therefore a student who is approaching or meeting the standards who may usually be in an ICT or Self Contained classroom,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      might move to a general education classroom to receive ELA instruction, (in the least restrictive environment) but return back  to their classroom for Mathematics (where they need more support because they are not meeting their IEP goals.).  In  addition, these same students receive 4-8 periods of ENL instruction based on their NYSITELL/NYSESLAT levels, weekly. The  scheduling of this instruction is planned around the classroom schedule, with a licensed ENL service provider who will provide  support in and out of the classroom.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention Programs for ELLS include:  •  Speech services in Spanish and English for students who qualify in grades K-5.  •  AIS programs are provided for Level 1 and Level 2 students in Grades K-5. Students are referred for AIS by their classroom  teacher. In Grades K-5, students are serviced for ten weeks by a qualified provider using a pull-out model. Students are seen 3- 5 days per week, depending on the availability of the provider and the needs of the students. Depending on each individual  situation, students may be invited to continue services after the ten weeks.  •  Great Leaps is a comprehensive intervention program for reading, fluency and language that is designed to generate  significant and lasting gains.  The program includes four parts; sound awareness (phonological/phonemic awareness), letter  recognition and phonics, high frequency sight words and phrases, and stories for oral reading.    These interventions are provided for ELLS who have moderate to significant reading and language difficulties.  We provide it to  ELLS who are at the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning level.  •  Guided reading helps ELLs who are both good and struggling readers.  Guided reading groups are pulled according to reading  ability.  Students are given the opportunity to have differentiated, teacher led instruction in a small group setting to help  ELLs with developing an understanding of what they are reading while encouraging them to apply reading strategies they will  need to become independent  readers.  This instruction happens in either English or Spanish depending on the student.  •  Fundations provides our ELLs in grades K-2 with a systematic program in the foundational skills for reading and spelling,  emphasizing phonemic awareness, phonics word study, high frequency word study, fluency, vocabulary, handwriting and  spelling.  •  ESTRELLITA provides our Spanish ELLs in the Dual Language program grades K-1 with a systematic program in the  foundational skills for reading and spelling, emphasizing phonemic awareness, phonics word study, high frequency word study,  spelling, vocabulary and fluency in Spanish.   •  S.P.I.R.E is a research proven reading intervention program for our lowest performing Special Education English Language  Learners (SPELLs).  Lessons are clear and explicit to keep the teacher at the center of instruction.  There are systematic,  sequentially structured 10 step lessons that ensure mastery of concepts in different critical areas of reading.  •  The Sadlier vocabulary program and online component will serve Special Education English Language Learners in grades 3- 5.  This program will focus on making vocabulary instruction achievable for SPELLs by focusing on fewer words at a time to  deepen their understanding of each word meaning.  Words will be taught in context to help students learn about the way  these words are used as well as how to use context clues to determine meaning of words.     •  Title III in collaboration with the Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation (SASF) is an after school program servicing ELLS in  grades 3-5.  The emphasis of the program is to explicitly teach reading and vocabulary skills as well as prepare students to take  the NYSESLAT.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year we have several changes and improvements designed to meet the needs of ELLS and the NEW  ELLs mandates.   •   Dual Language classrooms have been opened in PRE-K through 4th grade.  •   We have hired a NEW ENL Coordinator who is familiar with the new ELL mandates and will be attending ongoing  professional development to better service students and staff.  •   ENL teachers will be attending professional development sessions to support their teaching in the classroom with  their ELL  population.  •   After looking closely at the data we will not continue with the after school program from last year.  Our focus is to ensure  we are closing the achievement gap between our ELLS and Non-ELLs.  To reach this goal, we are creating a new after school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      ENL program that will focus on vocabulary, language acquisition, reading skills as well as provide extra test support for our ELLS  taking the NYSESLAT in grades 3, 4 and 5.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not closed a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLS are afforded equal access to all school programs offered by our school.  As stated above in question #9, after looking  closely at the data on last years NYSESLAT, Teacher's College reading levels and ELA New York State Exam  grades 3-5 we determined that ELLS who attended the after-school program last year did not make significant progress.  This  year our focus is to ensure we are closing the achievement gap between our ELLS and Non-ELLS.  Our ELL students were 35  points away from making Adequate Yearly Progress in ELA and 25 points from making AYP in math.  To reach this goal, we  are creating a new Title III after school program in collaboration with the Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation that will focus  on vocabulary skills, language acquisition, reading strategies as well as provide extra support for our ELLS taking  the NYSESLAT test in grades.  Students will be provided small group instruction with a teacher and a teachers aid.  The  implementation of these lessons will help support students reading achievements and language acquisition.    Parents are informed about all programs offered to their children through emails, phone calls, fliers, ENL meetings,  PTA meetings, Facebook and Instagram.  We use the Translation and Interpretation services as much as possible and have  as many documents as possible translated.   We also ensure that we have translators available during meetings with parents  either in person or on the phone.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  •  Teachers College running records help ability group students for small group and one on one instruction in English.  •  Fountas and Pinnell running records help ability group students for small group and one on one instruction in Spanish.  •  Teachers College Reading/Writing Workshop has an ELL component of the program that helps teachers  differentiate instruction and focus on the needs of ELLs including explicit teaching of vocabulary with picture supports in  English and Spanish.   •  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT 2017/2018 edition is used to expose students to the different types sections, questions and  format of the exam.  •  Estrellita is a Spanish word study program that focuses on introducing students to letter sound recognition and multi-syllabic  words.  It is utilized in our dual language programs to compliment the English Fundations program.  •  Sadlier vocabulary program and online interactive component explicitly teaches vocabulary that is repeated over a five day  period using different types of activity.  The repetition of the program allows students to constantly be exposed to the same  words with the goal of student retention.      •  Guided reading books in English and Spanish help with identifying groups of students that are in the greatest need of  intervention to help adjust lesson plans for students.  •  Go Math has ELL supplemental lessons that help with explicit use of breaking down questions into parts, explicit teaching of  vocabulary and as well as incorporation of manipulatives.  •  Bilingual glossaries are offered to students in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies.  Students practice how to use these  glossaries during lessons to help with the understanding of words and concepts.  •  Interactive SMART boards, Laptops and iPads allow students to hear stories read out loud, interact with lessons and gives  them options to look up information as well as use it for picture support.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Teachers in DL and ENL classrooms provide home language support and engage all English Language Learners in instruction  that is grade-appropriate, academically rigorous, and aligned with the New York State Pre-kindergarten Foundation for the  Common Core, P- 12 Common Core Learning Standards,  New Language Arts Progressions and Home Language Arts by:  a)  Articulating specific content and language objectives.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      b)  Integrating explicit and implicit research-based vocabulary instruction.  c)  Providing opportunities for students to discuss content and problem-solve with peers.  d)  Anchoring instruction by strategically using research-based practices (e.g.,multimedia, visuals, graphic organizers, etc.)  e)  Providing special education supports, services, accommodations and specially-designed instruction to meet the specific  instructional needs of ELLS with disabilities.  f)  Designing, selecting, and implementing a high-quality curriculum that meets the needs of Early Learning ELLS, and supports  the New York State Pre-kindergarten Foundation for the Common Core  g)  Using academic language and content-area supports to strategically move ELLS along the language development continuum  utilizing the New Language Arts Progressions and Home Language Arts Progressions.      To encourage students to see connections between their home languages and instructed language we use the collective skills  and knowledge of all students (both ELL and EP students) in the classroom, in English as well as the home language. First- language instruction have long-term benefits for learning English. ELLS can benefit from reading instruction focused on five  components 1) phonics 2) phonemic awareness 3) reading fluency 4) vocabulary, and 5) reading comprehension.  Instruction is  adjusted to meet ELLS specific needs.     Students in both DL and ENL have access to dual language glossaries and dictionaries in their home language that can be used  in the classroom, at home or during any exam.       We also provide parent workshops in the parents preferred language to support home language and academic support outside  of school. These workshops are coordinated by the Parent Coordinator D. Pilios and ENL Coordinator Joanna Antoniou Tetro.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Everyone involved (ex: administrators, teachers, ENL coordinator, service providers, counselors) meet to discuss, plan, and  accommodate all required services that support and correspond to ELLS of all ages and grades. We keep in mind the following  Principles and Goals:  1) Rigorous Instruction        a)  Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every  classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.  2)  Supportive Environment        a)  General Ed, Special Ed, Dual Language, and ENL teachers establish a classroom and school culture where students feel  safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers.  3)  Collaborative Teachers        a)  All teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity  to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. Professional  Developments focus on reading, writing, fluency, and language goals for each particular grade.   4)  Strong Family-Community Ties        a)  School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and  developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  5)  Trust        a)  Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and  beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value each  other.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    At times, Professional Development sessions are attended together and the information we have obtained from the PDs is  shared with our colleagues.  Since we do not have access to each others students (we are two different DOE schools) we try to  help each other with general questions that may arise about particular students or compliance questions we may need  clarification with.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         When newcomers first enroll they are welcomed by the pupil accounting secretary as well as the ENL coordinator.  Following  introductions and a tour of the school, the ENL coordinator  sits down with the student and interviews them.  At this point the  parent coordinator familiarizes herself with the family.  Student and parent(s) and/or guardians are escorted to their new class  to meet the teacher.  Within the first week of school the guidance counselor meets with the student and gets to know them so  they feel comfortable enough to go to them if there is a need.  If the guidance counselor speaks a different language from the  student, a pedagogue in the building can help with interpretations  The ENL coordinator checks periodically on the student to  make sure they feel safe and welcomed.  The students' teacher and the ENL coordinator meet to discuss next steps with the  student.  Parents are invited to newcomer workshops that are facilitated by the parent and ENL coordinator to keep parents  informed of the curriculum and expectations.  Students are also invited to attend the Title III after school  program.  Bilingual glossaries are introduced to students and are encouraged to use them accordingly.  We also provide parent  workshops in the parents preferred language to support home language and academic support outside of school. These  workshops are done by the Parent and ENL Coordinators.  Whenever possible, we give all letters and notifications to parents in  their home language.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    None     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a. The time is split equally, 50/50 between Spanish and English (the target language).   b. The entire instructional day is integrated with no content areas being taught separately. Students are  strategically seated according to different language proficiency levels so that students can also serve as  language models to each other.   c. Language is separated daily and not by subject, teacher, or theme. Alternate language  (English/Spanish), is used each day of the week. For example, "A Week" is: Monday: Spanish, Tuesday:  English, Wednesday: Spanish, Thursday: English and Friday: Spanish (Spanish dominant week), while "B  Week" is: Monday: English, Tuesday: Spanish, Wednesday: English, Thursday: Spanish, and Fridays:  English (English dominant week).   d.  The Dual Language Model used is the self-contained, roller coaster model.  e. Both languages, English and Spanish, are taught simultaneously as there are Spanish and English  dominant students in the class.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL Coordinator, ENL teachers, Dual Language teachers, Assistant Principal, Pupil Accounting Secretary, Guidance  Counselor and Parent Coordinator all attend professional development at some point through out the school year to  familiarize themselves with best practices.  These best practices include: a) how to teach ELLS to communicate, become critical  thinkers and problem solvers b) the implementation of the New Language Arts Progressions and Home Language Arts   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         Progressions c) Compliance and Regulations.    Some of these Professional Developments include but are not limited to:  1)  ELL Liason Meetings (ENL Coordinator/Assistant Principal)  2) Co-Teaching in the Integrated ENL Classroom (ENL Teachers/ENL Coordinator)  3) New Teacher Institute for Teacher of ELLS (ENL Teachers/Dual Language Teachers)  4) ELL Specific Overview for Parent-Coordinator   5) Ell Specific Overview for School Counselors  6) ELL Specific Overview for Pupil Accounting Secretaries   7) Teachers College Reading and Writing Units of Study for ELLS (ENL Coordinator/ENL Teachers/Dual Language Teachers)  8) In-house planning and professional development supporting strategies designed to help instruct ELLS in the classroom and  Dual Language program (ENL/Dual Language Teachers)  9) NYSESLAT training for implementation and scoring of exam (Administration/ENL Coordinator/ENL and Dual Language  Teachers)    During these trainings, teachers learn how students at each of the five levels (EN, EM, TR, EX, CM)  can meet the Common Core  Standards for their grade level by using grade level text with appropriate supports.  Teachers learn  how to embed scaffolds to demonstrate how students can meet grade level indicators using grade level content and  text.  Teachers are trained in developing formative assessments, the use of progressions to design instruction as well as  targeting instruction for students developing a new language while applying different bilingual common core initiative  progressions in different classrooms and programs.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As stated above in question #1, teachers are sent for professional development outside of the building on an ongoing basis  through out the year. (see schedule above)  They either attend regional/district professional development opportunities or full  day PD workshops held by Teachers College. Attendance is taken at these meeting and agendas are kept in teacher created  files so as to keep track of their PD hours.  Besides trainings outside of our school, we conduct our own professional  development trainings in-house.  These training are either facilitated by the Assistant Principal or the ENL  Coordinator.  Monthly in-house meetings are held with all ENL/Dual Language teachers to go over best practices, protocols and  testing.  Attendance is taken at every meeting and agendas are kept on file by the ENL Coordinator.  Besides monthly  meetings, the ENL coordinator is available to meet with teachers one on one to assist with any questions, issues or concerns  they may have.  The ENL Coordinator constantly checks in with teachers to make sure systems and structures are in place.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our goal is to provide a meaningful link between the school and home.  Besides parent-teacher conferences and initial parent  orientations we  will meet with the parent(s) and/or guardians of English Language Learners at least twice a year to discuss the  goals of their child's program, language development progress, English language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all content areas.   During these meetings the ENL Coordinator will meet with parents to sufficiently  inform them about their child’s language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68            case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program.  We provide parents with a meaningful opportunity to participate  in and have access to programs and services critical to their child's education program by ensuring there is appropriate  translation and interpretation services for  limited proficient parents.    First we collect data regarding the home language  spoken by the parent of each child enrolled in our school.  We make available translation and interpretation services for  parents either by direct translation from a DOE staff person in our building or telephone translation.  We also translate  documents containing critical information regarding a students education in each of the covered languages.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our goal with ELL parent(s) is to create cultural awareness and a better understanding of all our families at PS 17 Q.  This  translates into better relationships within the classroom as well as between families and school. In our efforts to do this, we  conduct ENL workshops on an as needed basis to support parents with questions they may have about: a)  curriculum, b)  language and development of their child, c) NYSESLAT testing, d) navigating our on-line programs.  Besides these workshops,  we have held several and will continue to hold Dual Language program events such as Winter/Spring mixers for parents to  promote a horizontal and vertical community.  Parents come together to celebrate successes as well as learn strategies that  have or haven't work for students in the program.   Two other big event that are attended by parents of ELLS is culture night as well as family game night.  Culture night creates  opportunities for parents to engage in sharing their home cultures and their own expertise. This helps foster a positive attitude  toward ELL children about their first language and different learning experiences.  Family game night allows families to play  and enjoy one another while developing relationships amongst the school community.  Other ways we involve ELL parents is  by looking for ways to get them to participate and volunteer in our school community by encouraging them to take on  leadership roles. (ex:  volunteer in the classroom and/or school events, join the Parent Teachers Association (PTA), School  Leadership Team (SLT), decorating committee, or welcoming committee)    Lastly, we provide resources in many different  languages to show we value all languages and the maintenance of them.        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    We at P.S.17 Q strive to create a genuinely supportive learning environment where every student feels valued, included and  empowered.  Our daily routines, learning activities and standards for appropriate behavior are all designed to promote learning in  productive classrooms.  Our teachers work collaboratively on approaches to teaching and learning so that ALL students have  opportunities to acquire language skills and learn new concepts  through reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, thinking and working with hands on materials.  We work together with our  ELL families to build a partnership based on mutual respect that empowers parents to feel they are a valuable part of our school  community.                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rebecca Heyward, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70              Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Henry D.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the beginning of each school year, the staff is surveyed to determine all languages that are spoken, written and  read by them. The ENL Coordinator runs the RLER/RLAT report from ATS to gather the number of languages  (preferred language of communication) spoken in each household. This report displays the home languages of  each student who will take the NYSESLAT in the Spring. We also look at the RAPL report (Adult Preferred Language  Report) and/or the RCPL (Parent's Preferred Language Report) in ATS which gives more information on the  languages spoken at home. All DOE translated documents containing critical information regarding a student's  education are then distributed based on the covered languages. In addition, all parents are asked if they need oral  translations when they have school meetings, appointments and/or concerns. We have Language Access Kits we  use that include a multilingual welcome poster, a Language Identification Guide to help determine the languages  spoken by parents, a brochure about the services provided by the translation and interpretation unit and  instructions on how to obtain an interpreter. Displayed in the main lobby are signs in various languages stating  that these services can and will be provided. When determining the various translation and interpretation needs,  P.S. 17 reviews the languages that represent our school population. Dependent upon the grade level/levels that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      must receive information we request translations of all written documents in the languages that are represented  in those grades. These documents are then provided to teachers as per their request. In addition, when the Home  Language Identification Surveys are completed, we review the last question on the HLIS to confirm the preferred  language of communication for each parent. During Parent/Teacher Conferences, we use staff members in the  building to help with interpretation services to speak to our parents based on their request. P.S. 17 has a large  number of parent and staff members who speak a second language. These staff members are used on a daily  basis when needed. We also use the Translation and Interpretation unit to help reach families who need help  communicating in English. The Unit offers free translation services by connecting us with over the phone  interpretation services for parents that communicate in other languages.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Depending on the situation, during a school wide emergency we use a messaging system (telephone/text/e-mail)  called Blackboard Connect to contact parents in their home language. We continue to encourage parents to sign up  for Notify NYC to receive alerts. We have an active Facebook and school website account that keeps parent informed  as well. If we need to get in contact with a specific child's parent, a DOE staff member that identifies with the  language will make any of the phone calls necessary to contact all of the LEP parents.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The Translation and Interpretation Unit has provided training to our parent coordinator on language access  requirements. The ENL coordinator will also attend a meeting to familiarize her self with these requirements. This  information will be turn keyed to all staff members during our whole staff meetings. Copies of the regulations are  given to staff members. They are read and discussed amongst the staff and administration. Our goal is to ensure all  Limited English Speaking parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in all of the programs and  activities we provide to their children as well as keep them informed of services critical to their child's education.  Within the first week of student enrollment the ENL coordinator will conduct an interview with the parent to  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         determine the primary language spoken in the home. Provided to the parents who require language assistance will be  translation and interpretation services to help them communicate effectively with the school community. Parents can  either choose to rely on an adult friend/companion or relative for language and interpretation services or we can  provide communication with the Translation and Interpretation Unit either at the location where the parent is seeking  to communicate or by telephone. All of this information is shared with the teacher so they are aware of which  language the parent needs to be communicated with. We also have qualified DOE staff members in the building can  also be used for interpretation when necessary.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      P.S. 17 will abide by Chancellor’s Regulation A-663. Evidence of this is seen through translated displays in the main  lobby that represent our school’s language needs as well as the large welcome sign displayed in front of the building  in different languages. There is a large poster when you enter the building that indicates who the Language Access  Coordinator is. Oral and written translation services will be made available and we will continue to access the  Translation Service Unit for phone conferences when we cannot utilize in-house staff members. Our Parent  Coordinator will continue to distribute DOE memos that represent our parent language needs and all general  information that the school must post is done so in all of our different languages. P.S. 17 will continue to be in  compliance with Chancellor’s Regulation A-663. The Parents’ Bill of Rights has been posted in all languages that reflect  our school community. We also provide each parent with a copy of the bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which  includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. In addition, our Parent Coordinator/Language  Access Coordinator will continue to update school officials about particular parent translation needs. P.S. 17 will  continue to use internal and external resources on a daily basis. We will continue to review parent surveys and will  monitor any and all languages of newly admitted students as per the Home Language Identification Survey.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The ENL coordinator will organize meetings with parents to remind them about language services they are entitled to  as well as share any other information parents may need. In addition, the ENL coordinator creates newsletters that go  home to parents reminding them of the language services we offer and how they can request for it if they need it.
