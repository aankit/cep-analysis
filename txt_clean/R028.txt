This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the Eagle Academy for Young Men is to develop young men committed to the pursuit of academic  excellence, strong character and responsible leadership.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As an all-male single gender school we have created academic and social structures that support and develop our  young men throughout their seven-year experience at our 6- 12 school. Our school culture of mentorship and shared  responsibility is supported through our house model approach. At Eagle, we expect all Scholars to follow the rules and  expectations of Eagle and embody all the Eagle core values to ensure that our young men reach their full potential as  globally conscious and globally competitive community leaders.   For the 2018-2019 school year, our school will participate in the Middle School Quality Initiative operated by the  Office of Interschool Collaborative Learning (OICL). The goal of MSQI is to ensure that all children entering 9 th grade  can read on or above grade level and are firmly on the path to high school, college, and career success. This initiative  is built on the Five Pillar Literacy Framework based on the Carnegie Corporation’s Reading Next Report which makes  formal recommendations for both instructional and structural shifts for secondary schools. As a school growing into a  6-12 model, this initiative is an ideal fit. .   Another partnership that the school will have for the 2018-2018 school year is the SONYC OST program. SONYC will  provide our students with the support of caring adults and offer engaging, fun activities designed to encourage  participants to pursue their passions and help them though the challenging years of early adolescence, often a  difficult and demanding time for both students and their families. In brief, this program will reinforce the joy of  learning.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Young men in the subgroup of Student With Disabilities (SWDs) account for 36% of our population in the 2018-19  school year. As such, the need to develop a robust advisory/mentoring program will need to be developed. Students  in this subgroup have varying learning needs, especially in English and Math. Additionally, our ENL population  constitute about 5% of our population with whom we work to develop their language acquisition skills. The staff and  school leaders will work together to develop a program called STOMP-Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship  Program. This enables both teachers and students to work more collaboratively to meet the social-emotional needs of  students in this subgroup and tackle the obstacles to their learning.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   For the 2018-2019 school year, the elements of the Framework in which our school made the most progress in are  developing avenues for our teachers to collaborate and strong family-community ties. Going forward, an element of  focus for us will be rigorous instruction and trust, especially since our staff will be expanding.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R028   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   253   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      According to the 2016 Framework for Great School Report:     All 4 surveyed areas received 4.0 points or higher.    According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, as noted on Page 7:              The school leader communicates to the school community through messages on the whiteboard located in   the main office and through other verbal and written structures. Teachers, including those new to the  profession or requiring extra assistance, receive support to help them achieve expectations. An example of  this was given when teachers shared that the principal is responsive to their needs for support in  implementing best practices as it relates to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. The principal wanted to  focus on academic vocabulary to strengthen teacher practice and student performance so he solicited the  assistance of the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) to provide additional professional learning  opportunities for science and math teachers.     The school leader works with staff members to plan lessons and other professional learning opportunities   that help to lead to more teachers incorporating effective teaching practices into their repertoire. For  example, during the large teacher meeting, teachers shared that they learned how to incorporate more  student voice into lesson activities. They shared that they saw videos, participate in intervisitations with their  colleagues, and are able to share ideas with each other. Teachers also commented that they are able to self- select any workshop they would like to attend and then are given an opportunity to turnkey what they  learned to other teachers. During the teacher team meetings, teachers remarked that the principal provides  feedback to them in a non-evaluative manner and offers his support or the support of lead teachers to help  them achieve expectations. For example, a new teacher commented that she was having trouble  implementing the Socratic seminar approach into her class and the principal provided extra coverage for her  to visit a colleague to experience the class firsthand. Now she is able to better engage in this type of  performance task.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23            According to the 2017 NYC Framework for Great School Report:     97% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader encourages feedback   from parents/guardians and the community through regular meetings with parent/guardian and teacher  leaders.     99% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader at their school is strongly   committed to shared decision making.     99% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader at their school works to   create a sense of community in the school.     100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader makes clear to the staff his or her   expectations for meeting instructional goals.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Staten Island, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Staten Island will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessments can be given before, during or after a lesson.  Group work, journals, quizzes, exit tickets, self-reflections are some  example of informal assessments used.  Formal assessments used include performance tasks, iReady and DRPs.  Results from  these assessments are used to help guide instructional planning for all students, including ELLs.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support this effort teachers are provided with class sets of laptops for any online assessments.We also have a  testing team that meets at least once a month to discuss which and when assessments will be given.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46          In order to identify areas of need, Eagle Academy administers NYC Performance Tasks (MOSLs), ELL Periodic Assessment, and  iReady to identify progress and areas of need.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once data has been gathered educators will have a better understanding of the needs of all students, ELLs and non-ELLs.This  will allow them to differentiate their lessons based on the abilities and needs of the students in that class.Groups can also be  formed with these results in mind to really hone in on struggles for those select students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A – We currently have Grades 6 through 9     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSELAT results are provided to all educators of ELLs to ensure every teacher is aware of the needs of the ELLs in their  classroom.The ENL teacher is also aware of classroom assessment and ELA state exam scores to help guide ENL instruction.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   These findings are disseminated at the beginning of the year.  We use these findings to program students and group them  accordingly. Common planning time is included into educator’s schedules.This time can be used to disseminate these findings  in order to make adjustments to programming.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We are currently a 6-9 school, building up to 6-12.Our school has two locations, but we are one school.Freestanding  ENL is used for all grade levels.With only 2 entering level ELLs throughout the grades, standalone groups are one-on- one or two-on-one interactions, which is beneficial for intervention and remediation.Integrated ENL occurs mostly  during ELA classes, however 9th grade ELLs receive integrated instruction through other content areas as well.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    Eagle Academy ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency level. All ELL  students receive the required number of minutes of ENL instruction according to the CR Part 154-2. The 8th grade entering ELL  receives 360 minutes of ENL instruction, 180 standalone and 180 integrated ENL/ELA.The 9th grade entering ELL receives 540  minutes of ENL instruction, 180 standalone, 180 integrated ELA/ENL and 180 integrated ENL/core content area. Transitioning  and expanding ELLs will receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.Commanding ELLs will receive 90 minutes of integrated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ENL.We currently have no emerging level ELLs.  a. Both schools have 45 minute periods. Blocked classes are 90 minutes. The ENL teacher stays for 45 of the 90 minute blocks  in most situations for each day for ENL integration.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered each day. Students have a 90 minute ELA block most of the days of the week. The ENL teacher, as  well as the classroom teacher, use a variety of methods which create visual and concrete examples for their students as they  teach standardized curriculum. Teachers who work with ELL students work closely with the ENL teacher.Vocabulary and  concepts are broken down to simpler terms as necessary. Classroom teachers and ENL teachers review curriculum maps in  advance so that the ENL teacher can preview the lesson in advance for areas that need further clarification, development, or  eliciting of background knowledge.Common planning time is provided in order to analyze student work and to plan lessons,  creating a variety of activities during the group and/or independent work time to differentiate instruction to accommodate the  ELL students' needs.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs can be appropriately evaluated in their native tongue throughout the year through use of online resources, as well as in  house translators to discuss their achievements in their former schools, their studying habits, reading techniques, attitude  towards education, as well as hobbies and interests.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Instruction is differentiated for all ELL subgroups.  b. We currently have no SIFE students enrolled.  c. Newcomer ELLs labeled as entering receive standalone time in one-on-one or small group setting.Lessons are more focused  on individual needs of that ELL.  d. Developing ELLs receive integrated ENL/ELA instruction.They receive the same work as their classmates with help from the  ENL teacher whenever she is in the classroom.This help can come in the form of visuals, iPad use, graphic organizer, etc.  e. Long-term ELLs are also receiving integrated ENL/ELA instruction.They receive the same assistance as the developing ELLs. In  addition, the long term ELLs are currently in the same class, so when needed they are pulled with other non-ELL struggling  students for smaller group lessons.  f. Former ELLs also receive integrated ENL/ELA instruction.The ENL teacher tries to step back, so that the commanding ELLs can  adjust to lessons without the need of the ENL teacher.However, the ENL teacher leads and includes former ELLs into grouping  with non-ELL students.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs receive the same modifications that non-ELL-SWDs receive from their special education teacher, with the addition of  the support of the ENL teacher.An iPad is provided when ELLs need visual or vocabulary assistance.Sentence stems are also  helpful for ELLs when paragraph/essay writing.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teacher has access to ELL-SWD IEPs.This allows the ENL teacher to be fully aware of their goals and incorporate  strategies accordingly.Common planning time is also a great way for the ENL and special education teacher to sit and discuss  ways to help ELL-SWDs attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and core content areas are included in the freestanding ENL program.The  same curriculum is followed, however it is modified to fit the needs of the ELL students.There is currently no specific  intervention program being enforced, however, any assessment results will enable educators to create an appropriate  program.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our current program seems to be working quite effectively.  Integrated ENL allows ELLs to still feel part of a larger group,  which is good for social development.  It also enables them to not fall behind because they are not being pulled from core  content classes.  Standalone sessions give them the advantages of working in a one-on-one or small group setting.  There is no  added pressure to speak or answer questions aloud.  Also, they are not removed from core classes, so they are not missing  important instructional time.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Staten Island has never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded the same programs as non-ELLs.This includes any after school programs as well.There is no current after  school program that is specifically directed toward ENL students.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our school has laptops and iPads available at all times for ENL students to use for instructional support.  The iPad has the  ability to translate any text into their native language. We also have materials in both Spanish and Arabic. This includes, but is  not limited to, library books and dictionaries.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As previously stated, technology and Spanish and Arabic resources are available in all classes.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services support and resources will correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels. If needed, guidance is provided by  the school counselors, Mr. O. McDonald and Mrs. D. Batista. All libraries are leveled to students' grade, interests, and reading  levels.Our high school location has a library that is available to all students as well.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our middle school shares a building with IS49. Intervisitations have occurred to help guide instruction of classes containing  ELLs.Both locations also use the MSQI programs.Meetings have been had to help support how to properly and effectively  execute lessons from this program.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, Eagle Academy has a summer bridge program.This program is open to all incoming  6th graders, both ELL and non-ELL.Our school holds multiple orientations throughout the year, which include the ability to  meet currently enrolled students.This gives new enrollees the ability to ask questions and get an idea of what it is like to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         attend our school from a student’s perspective.They are also able to hear about the different programs and classes  offered.These orientations are available for ELLs and non-ELLs.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Our middle school currently has an Italian class.This class is offered to grades 6-8.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Eagle Academy does not have a dual-language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers are given the opportunity to attend professional development sessions.The ENL teacher turnkeys any important  information received at a PD to any staff members who teach ELLs.The ENL teacher also attends non-ENL PDs to help better  understand what is going on in the classroom.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher is informed of all professional development pertaining to ENL instruction.Many of these workshops inform  teachers how to properly implement the Common Core Learning Standards.The ENL teacher, as well as teachers of ELLs, are  given the opportunity to attend professional development workshops.As previously stated, if only the ENL teacher attends, she  will turnkey any important information to the other teachers.Educators are responsible for their own record keeping in terms  of PD hours.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of all students, ELL and non-ELL, have an equal opportunity for involvement at our school.These activities include, but  are not limited to, chaperoning trips, PTA meetings, and our upcoming Fall Harvest.As the year progresses, more opportunities  and activities will arise that will allow ELL parents to become more involved.Parent engagement occurs every Thursday and  allows all parents to come to the school to meet with teachers.This time can be utilized for parents of ELLs to discuss their  child’s needs with both the classroom teachers and the ENL teacher. Parent meetings are also scheduled to discuss goals and  NYSELAT purpose and structure.If translation is needed we have several staff members who can sit in on the meetings to  translate.Mr. Mohammad and Mr. Jawad are both fluent in Arabic and Mrs. Velasquez and Mrs. Molinaro are both fluent in  Spanish.We also have educators that are fluent in Russian, French, and Italian if ever needed.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         2.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jermaine Cameron, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Eagle Academy for Young Me                                                                              School DBN: 31R028  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
