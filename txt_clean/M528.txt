Background  Rise Schools have demonstrated:   ●   ●   they have the will and conditions in place to accelerate student growth and meet school improvement  benchmarks.  they have the capacity to lead/implement a school improvement strategy.   Rise Schools have seen some gains1 across multiple measures including graduation rates, college readiness, state  test scores and attendance. As a result, these schools will fully transition out of the Renewal Schools program at  the end of the 2017-2018 SY and continue under the guidance of the Office of Field Support, in partnership with  the Office of School Support and Supervision.    1All Rise Schools met at least 67% of their benchmarks, are not on the State’s Priority list, and have demonstrated a  sustainable school improvement structure that will allow them to build on their progress.    Six Rise Keys for Continued Improvement         1.  Strengthen the Instructional Core   2.  Strengthen Instructional Leadership Capacity   3.  4.  Apply a tiered approach to student intervention  5.  Promote a positive, inclusive school environment for students, staff, parents and   Improve Data Driven Practices   community partners  Increase monitoring and accountability   6.     Theory of Action  If the NYC Department of Education provides customized supports to Rise schools and principals designed around the  “Six Rise School Keys for continued improvement” then, Rise principals and their teams will have the tools and resources  to accelerate outcomes for ALL students and increase students’ access to an excellent and equitable education.    Structure of the Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP)   The Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for each  Rise school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, New  York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, Strong  Communities, including the following:   ●  Rise Benchmarks: please refer to the 2018-19 Rise benchmarks provided to your school.  ●  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and  documenting key areas of celebration and Rise through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Rise process.    ●  Setting mid-year point benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes and  goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five discrete  goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an action plan.  ●  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.   ●  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool   and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          5         ●   Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards (NGLS) and to support staff in effectively  responding to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.   ●  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.     The Framework for Great Schools and the R-CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Rise School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (R-CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review  and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities  and strategies that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          6         The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools      In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the American Institute of Research (AIR) Needs Assessment, the  NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools – they call it a Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement.  All Priority and Focus Schools and Focus   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Districts must use the new tool; and districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Education Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement         NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:     a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          8   a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the R-CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the R-CEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for R-CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Rise school and   meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Rise Key and the corresponding statement of   Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an  Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select  their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major  findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other  qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Discuss and respond to the guiding questions under each Framework element.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.     Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Rise Program Priorities    Our Rise Theory of Action (page 4) is drawn from research1 on turnaround schools, the DOE Framework for Great  Schools, DTSDE Tenets, and the Quality Review, which suggest that these key priorities have the greatest impact on  student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          9         RISE Keys   Priorities      1.

Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the   Framework for Great Schools and your Rise Benchmarks and indicate where this has been a challenge.   5.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   1. Contextual Information:      The Bea Fuller Rodgers Intermediate School 528 opened its doors on September 2002 as the first intermediate school  dedicated to the Arts in the Washington Heights community. Our school serves approximately 230 students, primarily  of Hispanic heritage, in grades 6th through 8th. Our ENL population comprises 26.5% of the student population and  SWDs make up 18.26 % of the student population. The average attendance from the 2017-18 school year was 97.8%.  Our school is housed in a well kept building where pride in the school's accomplishments is evident in the prominently  displayed student work.       Mission Statement    Bea Fuller Rodgers Intermediate School 528 is dedicated to preparing our children to become life-long learners. In our  enriched environment we promote high-level academic achievement through standards based curriculum, while  fostering love, respect, and appreciation for the Arts.    Vision   We envision the Intermediate School 528 community being the opportunity for our students to develop their talents  and gifts in the performing arts resulting in every child graduating with the knowledge, skills, and social values to  become successful citizens in the global community.   2. School Beliefs about Student Learning:      As a school community, we believe our students learn through multiple modalities. Creative expression is central the  development of the whole child. At Bea Fuller Rodger, we understand the critical role the arts play in our students  development, therefore, music, visual art, dance and drama are an integral part of everyday learning. We provide  learning experiences for students to learn through movement, visual expression, and project-based learning. Students  learn best when engaged in intellectual conversations that allows them to extend each others’ understanding by  challenging or building on each others' contributions.       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Academic rigor at 528 entails building opportunities into lessons for students to work on different levels requiring  them to ask and answer analytical questions, to present, explain, and to critique processes and performances, to  relate text curriculum to their world, and to inspire creativity. Students learn best when they are engaged in both  productive struggle via activities that are cognitively challenging and accessible. It is also essential to monitor student  progress through the use of formative and summative assessments to inform instruction and improve student  learning.      3. Special Student Population:      The subgroups in greatest area of need are the ELLs and SWDs. Bea Fuller Rodgers has 18.26 % of its students with  special needs. Bea Fuller Rodgers has 26.5 % its students Learning English as a new language (ENL). The vast majority  of students first language is Spanish.      School wide strategies and Interventions for English as a New Language Learners and Students with Disabilities:   Small group instruction  Support charts with accountable talk tools and protocols  Support charts with question prompts           RTI using i-Ready Resources    After school and Saturday programs will support high need subgroups by using research-based programs.   The administration supports intervention by developing schedules, providing professional development, and leading  conversations that address students with disabilities, English-language learners, and students at-risk.   4. School’s approach to family engagement      Our School’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as partners in furthering  student achievement. Parent Engagement is built through a variety of activities such as After school ESL classes,  Community Forums, Family Events and Trips, Coffee and Tea with the Principal, Parent Workshops, Parent  Association, , and participation in school committees. Teachers and families are in constant communication via Pupils  Path, Tuesday Parent Engagement, and invitations to academic celebrations.      5. Leveraging community school partnerships.      For the past four years, we have been designated a Community School by NYS and receive associated funding. We  have partnered with community based organizations in order to offer students and families opportunities and  activities in the areas of health and wellness, the arts, college and career readiness and academics. Current partners  include but are not limited to American Museum of Natural History, Bronx Zoo Wildlife Conservation Society,       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Our biggest success with regard to the Framework for Great Schools was in building capacity for strong family-  community ties. Bea Fuller Rodgers made great strides in welcoming, encouraging and developing partnerships with  families, businesses and community based organizations. Being a Community School allows more opportunities for  families and the community to collaborate. Having funding allows for student and parent incentives, during and after  school programs, events and collaborations with other community based organizations which increases the parental  involvement at IS 528. Having an on-site Community School Director provides opportunities for planning use of  resources that will benefit students and their families.       As, per the School Survey, Our Strong Family Community Ties rating for the 2017-18 school year 92% of our parents   submitted positive responses to the survey overall, above the District and NYC’s rating. Also, our parents response  rate was 100%.      For science, we started a partnership with the Urban Arts Advantage, which provides professional development for  teachers as well as opportunities for families and students to attend science-related field trips. For the arts  integration, we collaborate with Urban Arts Partnership, which involves Arts Integration and Story in the Studio. All of  our staff members have opportunity for professional development whether it is job-embedded and/or attending a  National Conference and/or Convention.   6. Expanded Learning Time (ELT)       During Expanded Learning Time all students are engaged in ELA and Math classes which reinforce skills and standards  which are implemented during the regular school day.             2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          16         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M528   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   224   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   1. Strengths       The Framework for Great Schools Report indicates that relative to the Rigorous Instruction element, the area of  celebration with a Well Developed rating in Pedagogy (Indicator 1.2) in the most recent Quality Review Report 2016-17.      Under the QR 1.2 Pedagogy section, the Quality Review Report indicates that, "Teaching practices are aligned to the  curricula and reflect an articulated belief that students learn best in discursive classrooms. Student-to-student  discussion and partnered work products take center stage in the vast majority of classrooms.The school leader and  faculty believe that students learn best in discursive classrooms, where there are high levels of student-to-student  discussions in which students share their ideas and have productive disagreements. Teachers across the school utilized a  well-paced workshop model to ensure that students have clear instruction in the use of a strategy or skill and have  ample time to engage in collaborative practice."      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          19      In addition, directly related to the The Rigorous Instruction Framework Element, as measure by the Quality Review, the  Curriculum (1.1) and Assessment (2.2) indicators are rated proficient Proficient.       Under the QR 1.1 Curriculum section, the Quality Review Report indicates that,"Curricula and academic tasks  consistently emphasize rigorous habits and higher-order skills, particularly opportunities for discourse across grades and  subjects for all students. Lesson plans reflect planning and refinement to provide access to tasks. Therefore, as a result,  "Curricula and academic tasks provide opportunities for students to practice rigorous habits and higher order thinking  skills. Diverse learners have opportunities to be cognitively engaged in the curricula." and      Under the QR 2.2 Assessment section, the Quality Review Report indicates that, "Across classrooms, teachers use  rubrics, glows and grows, and common grading practices. Teachers’ assessment practices consistently reflect the use of  ongoing checks for understanding, and student self and peer-assessment. "      2. Needs Relative to Rigorous Instruction:      NYS Tests: In 2017-18, in ELA 33.5 % of students scored at Levels 3 and 4 on the NYS Test, a 16.4 % increase. In 2017- 2018 in Math 23.4 % of students scored at Levels 3 and 4 on the NYS Test, 2.5% increase. A vast majority of ELLs and  SWDs scoring a level 1 in both ELA and Math. As a result, this year's Rigorous Instruction goal will aim at decreasing the  percentage of students performing at a Level 1 in Mathematics and ELA.      4. Data Trends and Sources       To continue strengthening The Capacity Framework Element- Rigorous Instruction, The Administrative Cabinet with the  collaboration of our School Leadership Team conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to identify our priority need  that will inform the development of our annual goals and action plan. The Instructional Leadership Team analyzed many  quantitative data sources and data trends and summarized the most significant student performance trends from the  NYS Mathematics and ELA Assessments (2017 - 2018), Quality Review Report, The School Quality Guide 2016-2017. The  findings are summarized below.      Sources      NYS Standardized Tests:     NYS Math Common Core Exam- With a total of 172 students tested, our percentage of students scoring at Levels   3 (17.8%) & 4 (5.6 %) is 23.4%.

What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    The 2018-19 school's Instructional Focus is using data to drive instructional decisions. By assessing students teachers  can use the data to adjust curricula to meet the needs of all learners. "Checking for Understanding is the backbone of  effective instruction. It is imperative that the teacher continually verifying that students are learning what is being  taught while it is being taught."       Vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across classrooms:      Bea Fuller Rodgers IS 528 strives to prepare our students to become life-long learners, ready for college, and prepared  to be successful citizens. We have adopted Common Core Aligned Programs and Curricula for all Core Content Areas.  School-wide we have developed pacing calendars and have implemented common assessments throughout the year  allowing for curriculum adjustments and targeted instruction. With a specific focus on utilizing common assessments  that drive curricula, informed grouping and instructional adjustments.      Data is at the core of instructional planning and monitoring student progress and achievement. In order to promote the  instructional focus consistently across classrooms administrators, teachers, and staff will collaboratively establish  systems and protocols to track progress, and use data to drive instruction.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          21         Through a series of workshops provided by the Assistant Principal, Data Wise Champion, Assessment Matters  Consultant, Math Consultant,ELA Consultant, ANET Consultant Model/PCT Teachers/PD Committee, teachers will build  their capacity to become familiar with the inquiry approach to monitor students' growth and modifying the curriculum.  In addition, school staff will continue to participate in inter-school visitations and conferences with a lens on assessment  and data.      Daily Common planning time teachers collaborate to adjust curricula, identify data aligned assessments, and analyze  student work/data to differentiate instruction, as well as, inform instructional next steps.         How will you implement a standards-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, including ELLs  and SWDs?  The I.S. 528 community is dedicated to preparing our children to become successful life-learners. In our enriched  environment we promote academic rigor through a standards based curriculum while fostering love, respect, and an  appreciation for the arts. This is accomplished through a clear understanding of our population, and culturally centered  instructional approach. Teachers will work collaboratively to create lessons that incorporate the students' diverse  cultures/backgrounds/families to make learning relevant to their everyday life experiences.       Teachers will continue using:   ● a common language and practices across content areas. For example, all teachers will use the workshop model for  their mini-lesson with an “Aim” and “Do Now.” The use of common rubrics for scoring all literary essays, informational  writing, and so forth will be generated through Teachers College. ● Common rubric and/or expectation for teacher team  meetings and planning time. The meetings’ agendas and minutes will be submitted via Google docs to provide  opportunities for feedback. There will be cycles of team meetings for inquiry work and curriculum mapping.    ● consistent checks for understanding (traffic lights) and the classroom guides that provide additional support for our  Emergent Bilinguals through the glossaries, “peer buddy” rubric, partnership talk rubric, and so forth.         What is your vision for ensuring that all student have access to rigorous coursework that moves them towards career  and college readiness? How will you support the personal and academic skills, habits, and behaviors needed for  students to be career and college ready?  Beginning with a strong base in CCLS-aligned curricula along with our Community Based Organizations our school  provides every child with experiences that enhance their knowledge, skills, and social values to be career and college  ready. All courses and partnerships with outside organizations will support students in developing organizational skills,  stamina, collaborative learning, academic discourses as well as, enhancing self respect and responsibility.      Instructional shifts are embedded in this vision through curriculum development and partnerships.

Teachers will regularly and consistently ensure that students are are challenged, able to participate in class discussions,  take part in collaborative group work and understand the curriculum.    Pedagogy across classrooms will emphasize data driven-based differentiation, student “doing,” and student  independence. Daily lessons will incorporate regular checks for checking for understanding and/or on the spot  assessment, as well as other assessments such as exit slips, end of unit assessments and projects, chapter tests, quizzes,  and I-Ready diagnostics   In order to monitor and track students' progress teachers will refine and implement assessments to track students’  learning progress and using the data as a tool to make instructional adjustments for all student subgroups including the  bottom 1/3.   Strategy groups, small groups, and additional interventions will be determined using the data gathered from daily  instruction and formative assessment (conferencing). Teachers will focus on setting goals with students and ensuring  students are regularly aware of their goals through the use of data trackers and collectively develop action plans to  reach these goals, and regularly meeting with students to assess progress. In this way students become more  accountable for their learning, develop meta-cognition, and continue to build independence as learners.      During Expanded Learning Time (1 hour per day), students will engage in social studies and science instruction; language  development; and targeted ELA and math support and enrichment.       In addition, during the expanded day (2 hours per day), students will receive music, fine art, reading tutoring, math  tutoring and sports instruction.           What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  During during teacher team common planning time teachers will engage in professional learning around providing  access through the use of multiple entry points. They will continue to use data to make purposeful and targeted  modifications and differentiated learning opportunities to their lessons and unit frameworks. During whole-school  professional learning sessions as well as during grade planning meetings, teachers will review their lessons and unit  frameworks and apply differentiated experiences and opportunities for multiple entries through the use of UDL  principles. Teachers will also work in grade planning teams to determine the efficacy of differentiated approaches to  instruction focusing on the different models of whole group and small group instruction (teacher-directed small group  instruction, small group and cooperative learning groups, one-to-one teacher, partnership work, independent work,  peer tutoring, and computer-based instruction such as MyOn, I-XL, and i-Ready)   Teacher leaders and consultants will discuss, model, and assess strategies used in classes across grades for teaching  strong reading and writing habits of mind, building reading and writing stamina across learners, targeting lagging skills  through small group and flexible strategy groups, facilitating inquiry through scaffolds and higher ordered questions.  Assistant principal and lead teachers will also work with teacher teams to make deliberate and purposeful decisions  around students’ next steps based on student work and other formative assessment data.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          23      School wide strategies and Interventions for English as a New Language Learners and Students with Disabilities:   Small group instruction  Support charts with accountable talk tools and protocols  Support charts with question prompts           RTI using i-Ready Resources    After school and Saturday programs will support high need subgroups by using research-based programs.              How do you envision differentiating teacher professional learning opportunities to support instructional foci, meet  students’ unique needs and advance culturally responsive education in your school?  The professional development committee administers a professional development needs assessment survey to identify  areas of focus. In addition, administration uses Advance to identify areas of needs. Learning walks are conducted  throughout the school year to identify progress, common trends and areas of need. The professional development plan  is modified based on data.

Supportive Environment:   Our school establishes a school culture where students are expected to be safe, be responsible, and be respectful  through our school PBIS initiative. The school community creates an effective learning environment which allows  students to develop relationships among teachers, students and families as well as other community members. To  promote a supportive learning environment we celebrate our students accomplishments through award ceremonies,  special events, displays of student work, and positive reinforcement. We have initiated the student ambassador  program that oversees community events, community services, senior activities, and grade level celebrations. these  additional offerings have positively impacted all of our students' school experiences. As a result, it has improved our  teacher and student attendance along with the building's overall tone.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Strengths:      In 2017-18, 23.4 % of students met state standards on the NY State Test, a 2.6 % growth from the 2016-17 NYS Math  Results.   In 2017-18, 33.5% of students met state standards on the NY State Test, a 16.4% growth from the 2016-2017 NYS ELA  Results.      Based on our school’s Quality Review Report 2016-2017, 5 out of the 10 areas were rated as Well Developed. As per the  2016-17 Quality Review Report, our area of celebration is Pedagogy (1.2) where we received a well-developed rating.  The school's Effective Leadership Indicators 4.1 was rated Well Developed and 4.2 Teacher Teams and Distributive  Leadership indicator was rated Proficient. We achieved this rating as we had daily allotted common planning time in all  teacher's schedules and weekly grade meetings. This gave teachers the opportunity to collaborate, modify curriculum,  analyze student work, plan units of study, create common CCLS align rubrics , and plan for inter-visitations which further  developed teachers abilities to differentiate instruction, utilize strategies observe and transfer new knowledge gained  into their own classroom.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Needs:   While the Teacher team and Leadership Development (4.1) indicator was rated in Proficient, the Quality Review Report  indicates that "The majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations that  promote discursive classrooms and students engagement. Teacher teams are not yet systemically analyzing data and  student work for students." Therefore, we need to expand inquiry based teacher collaborations focused on targeted  student population and increase the level of consistency across all content areas in tracking of mastery of goals for  groups of students.       As a result of the feedback provided, we will establish inquiry protocols across content areas with the support from the  Office of Renewal Data Wise Liaison and Assessment Matters consultancies, trainings, and professional development.  Each teacher team will collaborate, create protocols to analyze student data, and use the data to guide their instruction.  Model and PCT teachers will facilitate professional development and lead Teacher Team meetings as well as schedule  inter class visits..      Our lowest ratings on the Collaborative Teachers Framework portion of the Innovation and Collective Responsibility  survey was in the area of trying new ideas ( 67% positive response). We believe that if teachers were provided research  based strategies in a risk free setting where they have options on what areas to study and improve they may be more  encouraged to integrate new ideas. In addition, common prep periods will allow teachers to meet across grades and  departments, allowing ENL department teachers to interact with teachers at all grade levels in intellectual discussions  about what new and proven ideas might work best for subgroup of learners in addition to the focus on student  improvement as a whole.       This year's instructional focus is on utilizing common assessments that drive curricular and instructional adjustments. In  effort to support our staff and raise academic achievement, we have an Assistant Principal, ELA Consultants, ANET  Consultant, iReady Consultant, Assessment Matter Consultant, Math Consultant and one ELA/ENL PCT and 3 Math  Model teacher leaders through the Teacher Career Pathway initiative. The Principal, Assistant Principal, ELA/ENL PCT  along with 3 Model Teacher Team/ Professional Development Committee plan cycles of professional development  series building a common understanding of what assessment practices look like and how the data is used to drive and  differentiate instruction so that students needs are met.   Upon examination of the 2017-2018 NYS Math results, there was not a significant increase and students receive 0 points  in constructive response questions.    Pending Data:   In the area of student achievement, in 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot Report, the school was rated "Fair" in ELA in the  Growth on State Test Section for all students and for the School's lowest one third. In the Closing the achievement gap  section, the school was rated "Good" in ELA for ELLs and City's Lowest Performing Students and "Fair' for Students with  Special Needs.         Priority Needs:   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Based on our latest leadership teacher observations it was observed that our staff needs to continue to use data to  modify and differentiate instruction. There is a high need for stronger collaboration for teachers to design instruction for  all student groups and assessments which area aligned to data identified needs. Again, there is a need for teacher  collaboration focused on targeted student population and increase the level of consistency across all content areas in  tracking of mastery of goals for groups of students.      Based on our recent Quality Review, there is an unevenness amongst Teacher Teams in using an inquiry approach to use  data to determine instructional next steps and modify instruction. As a result of the recommendation in the most recent  Quality Review, teachers across content area need to use the inquiry approach to analyze data and student work.  Assessment is the instructional focus this year. School has decided to become a Data Wise and Assessment Matters  school to support this initiative.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     The Bea Fuller Rodgers School vision for collaborative teachers is for all teachers to meet during their embedded  common planning periods to collaboratively plan lessons and unit plans. Data is at the core of instructional planning and  monitoring student progress and achievement. In order to promote the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms administrators, teachers, and staff will continue to implement check for understanding an identify common  assessments across the content areas.      Teacher Teams will collaboratively build on existing systems and protocols to use data to drive instruction, as well as, to  track progress of student subgroups. Via an inquiry approach, teachers will continue to analyze student work by using  the school-wide "Looking at Student Work Protocol" to plan for instructional next steps. Each department Teacher Team  will implement Data Wise and Meeting Wise protocols including taking minutes and log their data findings in Google  Docs.      Teachers engage in collaborative learning during weekly Monday Professional Learning sessions for 2 hours and 35  minutes. School-wide we have developed pacing calendars and have implemented common assessments throughout  the year allowing for curriculum adjustments and targeted instruction. With a specific focus on utilizing common  assessments that drive curricula, informed grouping and instructional adjustments.      Through a series of workshops provided by the Assistant Principal, Data Wise Liaison, Assessment Matters Consultant,  Math Consultant, Model/PCT Teachers/PD Committee, teachers will build their capacity to become familiar with the  inquiry approach to monitor students' growth and modifying the curriculum. In addition, school staff will continue to  participate in inter-school visitations and conferences with a lens on assessment and data.      In the 2017-2018 school year, we launched Departmentalized Inquiry Teams which will follow structures and protocols  to assess, monitor and utilize data to drive instructional decisions and meet students’ needs. We believe that assessing  students understanding in order to modify and drive instruction is key to their success. Through common planning,  teachers develop curricula and data aligned assessments, analyze student work using systems and protocols to track   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          40   progress, and use the data to drive instruction. By having a model Data Wise inquiry team, teachers can then lead  branches of inquiry work during common planning.                    How do you envision enhancing collaboration amongst your Instructional Leadership Team to improve teacher  practices and student learning?  This year, we have two administrators, an ELA Peer Collaborative Teacher, Math and ELA Consultants, Assessment  Matters, Consultants, iReady Consultant, Department Leads, Math Model Teachers who collaborate with teachers  facilitating professional learning opportunities, encouraging professional conversations, and and serve as our  professional development committee      To promote teacher collaboration we have created systemic structures within the school’s programming schedule.    Content area teams meet a minimum of three times per week using an inquiry approach. (DATA WISE) All teachers  will analyze student work and data to plan how they will differentiate instruction. Teachers will all be expected to  follow the School-Wide Collaborative Teacher model. We believe academic achievement increases when teachers use  data to make instructional decisions. Collectively teachers will develop common assessment tools, implement  assessments, and analyze student work. Together they will determine strengths and weaknesses, reflect on  pedagogical practices and make modifications to the curriculum in order to meet the needs of students.       Administrators will monitor Teacher Collaborations by participating and providing feedback to teams.   The School Instructional Leadership Team will meet on a weekly basis to discuss school issues and implement  strategies to increase academic rigor. This team will discuss professional development sessions, new initiatives,  school goals, assessments, and the structures for common planning and ICT. Through these discussions we will be  able to make instructional decisions that will benefit our school community, increase academic rigor, and improve  student achievement. The members of this team will then turnkey the information to the rest of the staff during  teacher team meetings.            How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  During team meetings, to improve teacher practices and promote student learning teachers will:   Collaboratively use the Looking at Student Work Protocol to analyze student work and identify next instructional steps,  glows and grows for the student, and flexible group students for small group instruction. Teachers will look data (ELA  and MATH, and I-Ready Reports) and student work to Identify the targeted CCLS standards/strands in units and lessons.  Teacher Teams will differentiate instruction to meet individual students needs and determine best instructional  practices to use to scaffold instruction for groups of students. Consistently implement research-based instructional  practices/strategies to meet all students needs.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          41   In addition, to increase student achievement, teacher will discuss which Integrated Co-Teaching Models will be most  beneficial to students learning styles and needs.   Teacher teams meet 3-5 days per week. Each teacher team will be led by a teacher leader who will ensure that team  meetings are focused on using student data to introduce change or assess effectiveness of change as well as to increase  academic rigor. Each member of the teacher team will be expected to implement strategies suggested in meetings and  continue conversations around student change and academic achievement.      Suggested Teacher Team Meeting Protocols will be aligned to Data Wise practices.

Teachers will plan flexible groups for the target standards.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          42   NYS English Language  Arts and Math   Teachers will analyze and a identify a short list of standards in ELA and MATH to track for  progress based on the Item Skills Analysis. Thought an inquiry approach, teachers will  implement strategies targeting these specific standards and track students' progress.          Formative Assessment  Teachers will obtain information that can be used to make judgements about children's learning   behavior and characteristics or programs using means other than standardized instruments.  Teachers will analyze progress made, check for understanding, and make instructional decisions  based on the data.   Examples of formative assessments to check for understanding:   text-dependent questions,     daily exit slips,      quick writes,    RACE and Solve Rubrics    Notebooks for class work    Projects and experiments,    Unit writing pieces, and Math constructed Responses    Digital Portfolios     I-Ready progress monitoring assessment             Describe the screening process you use to identify students who need extra help? How do you use this process to  determine which intervention to provide?  Using Mastery Connect data, IReady data, and data collected in classrooms, we identify students who are in need of  intervention. Along with New Visions, we are able to identify specific students to target for RTI, after-school groups and  Saturday Academy academic achievement.

In the school survey responses, teachers said they would like to expand  this program to include visits to other schools as well. As a result, our focus for this year will be to continue inter- visitations but to expand them across schools. The principal will coordinate this activity with other principals across the  district and the city so that teachers may visit classrooms within the school and, at times classrooms in other areas  where highly effective teachers can share ideas and strategies around using assessments to drive student grouping,  strategies to support subgroups and monitoring student growth. .      Needs:   Regular inter-visitations will be scheduled so that teachers across the same grade and across the same content can  provide each other with feedback on the effectiveness of strategies and structures discussed in grade team and inquiry  meetings.      In addition, regular observational rounds of teacher practice (both ADVANCE-rated and non evaluative) will be  conducted to identify individual teachers' pedagogical needs and determine and provide appropriate supports and  professional learning opportunities. School administrators will also meet with consultants and coaches to discuss  teacher practice and track and monitor the level of progress in order to maintain a fluid needs assessment that will  result in tailored professional learning resulting in positive gains in student learning.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?   Effective School Leadership:      Administration encourages the school community to be life-long learners. Providing multiple opportunities for staff to  enhance their pedagogical practice through on-going city-wide, district-wide and school-wide professional development,  as well as inter-school and inter-class visitations. To develop and promote our own teachers into teacher leadership  roles, the principal empowers teachers through the collaboration with Teacher Career Pathways. We have established  strong data gathering systems to assess impact of all initiatives, programs, partnerships, and strategically targeted areas  of the school as they relate to students' achievement.      School leadership is a shared responsibility amongst various staff including the principal, assistant principal, teacher  leaders, guidance counselor, community assistant and parent coordinator. The school leader provides informal and  formal feedback on a regular basis. The Advance Platform will be utilized for more formal structures and the school- generated feedback forms for “academic rigor” and “common themes” based on the School Renewal Process will be  utilized. Most feedback will be provided within a conversation , a hand-written note, and/or an email.

Strong Family-Community Ties:   Our biggest area of progress and/or growth is in our strong family and community ties as evidenced by our parental  involvement at our school as well as our community. This is evidenced by our attendance at workshops as well as our  involvement in the community.      To continue strengthening The Capacity Framework Element- Strong Family and Community Ties, The Administrative  Cabinet with the collaboration of our School Leadership Team conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to identify  our priority need that will inform the development of our annual goals and action plan. We analyzed many quantitative  data sources and data trends and summarized the most significant parent trends from the NYC School Survey Report  (2016 - 17).

For 2016-2017, Parent Teacher Conferences attendance increased by 25%.      The school was rated Well Developed in 3.4 High Expectations.          Data Source: NYC School Survey Report    As, per the School Survey, our Supportive rating for the 2016-17 school year 92 % of our parents    submitted positive responses to the survey overall, above the District and NYC’s rating. Also, our parents response rate  was 100%                     Findings: As noted in the survey, a total of 97% of parents surveyed reported that school staff regularly  communicates with parents/guardians about how parents can help students learn.     93% of parents/guardians surveyed indicated that they communicated with their child's teacher about their   child's performance and have also seen their child's projects, artwork, homework, tests or quizzes.     96% reported being greeted warmly when they call or visit the school.

School   participation becomes challenging for them because of their job responsibilities. We are working towards  increasing parent involvement in the school workshops and student activities. As a school community we need  to continue to engage our parents in meaningful conversations to motivate them and to do their best to be part  of the learning opportunities we offer in our school. It was also noticed that parents in our school feel open to  talk to staff who speak their native language.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for strong family and community ties at your school?  What opportunities exist for the school staff  to know the students and their families in order to better communicate and partner with families and communities in  the vision for the school?   1.  The Administrative Cabinet and the School Leadership Team believe that developing teacher capacity and   encouraging strong teacher collaboration with the support of the administration in each of the content areas  will result in the creation of different avenues to connect with parents and offer them multiple opportunities to  become strong team players to support our students to become successful and powerful long life learners.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.    Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should aligned to the  Rise Benchmarks.

Community Schools  bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and family  engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – The Community School Program Goal(s)   How is the Community School strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it  had on student academic outcomes?  The Community School strategy is integrated into academic instruction through different avenues of support at IS528.  In the classroom, we implement it through Story Studio in ELA classes, STEM integration in Science and dance  choreography integration in Physical Education. This collaboration provides extra support for our students in  academic differentiation, student-teacher ratio and teacher collaboration which leads to an increase of academic  achievement while honoring the push for Art integration in the classroom. The other major avenue of support of the  Community School Goals surrounds the socio-emotional/Attendance interventions. For mental health, we count with  the support of Wediko, which works in partnership with the school counselor to monitor our students mental well  being. On attendance interventions, an strategic team is composed by the CSD, support staff and faculty to implement  timely supports through success mentor, school wide and individual interventions, and data driven monitoring in  partnership with New Visions.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct  the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   By June 2019, all of students and families will have participated in one aspect of the Community School Model as  evidenced by a 2.5% increase in attendance forms and their participation in a school event.          Please answer the following question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  ELT: An structured, data-driven, and goal oriented ELT will allow students to reinforce student retention and practice,  creating an avenue for improvement across all student individual performance.   Attendance supports: While continuing using effective methodology, programming and team-based attendance  strategies, improving the student presence in the school community will directly effect into his/her academic  performance.   Family Engagement: A celebratory, routinely structured and parent-led family engagement process will allow families  to be informed and empowered to support students academic outcomes by establishing a true school to home  connection between the school and their families. It will ensure families to be on top of students academic  performance, and develop mechanisms of parent support.    Health and Wellness: By continuing the monitoring of our students well being through our counseling partnership  team, we will ensure students are supported emotionally to achieve their academic goals. This, paired up with a  committed school environment community will help achieve so. We will further continue partnerships to develop an  active physical lifestyle for our students, and systems of health support through the school health office and our  partnership with NYC Health for Asthma monitoring and prevention.            2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          71     Part 2 – Community School Program Description   Part 2a.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All of our teachers are fully certified, licensed, and considered highly qualified according to the ESEA. In order for our  teachers to achieve this goal, we provide professional development both in-house, and district and city wide  organizations such as Teachers College and Southern Cross Consultancy.   When we have an opening, we utilize our Hiring Committee as well as our collaborations with higher organizations  such as Teachers College. For example, we can post a “job opening” if needed on the TCWRP Board. Another way to  recruit is through recommendations among colleagues and/or networking.   At our school, we have a high level of teacher retention with most teachers having at least five years or more teaching  experience. We promote teacher retention by developing leadership capacity and leadership opportunities within our  school community through the Teacher Incentive Fund and presenting at conferences. We currently have six model  teacher at IS 528. Teachers are a part of the decision-making process, and it shows in the activities and the curriculum  provided.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All of our staff members participate in weekly professional development that operates in four week cycle of analysis  of student work, vertical curriculum alignment, horizontal curriculum alignment, and collaboration. We also provide  job-embedded professional development through our on-site and off site staff developers from Teachers College,  Kagan and Southern Cross Consultancy. In addition, we have supports from Renewal Schools, Manhattan Field Center  and Citywide professional development opportunities for our staff. Teachers College also provides professional  development for paraprofessionals, ELA, and content area teachers as well as administrators. In addition, Dr. Lynch  will continue to support teachers across content areas with a focus on writing.   Our PD Committee meets monthly to reflect and to make adjustments on our professional development. For  administrators, our principal is part of the Urban Education Leadership Program and the TC Project.

Not applicable (middle school)        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams formally meet 3-5 times a week to collaborate. For professional development, we have a committee  that meets on a monthly basis. All staff members were invited to become a member of the PD Committee with the  goal of having all of the departments represented. For our Measures of Student Learning Committee, we have at least  one person from each department. Prior to making the MOSL decisions, each department met with their members to  make a consensus decision. At the end of each year, each department provides input on the curriculum as well as the  assessment measures.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (R-CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          80      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/R-CEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          82     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          83      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  R-CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bea Fuller Rodgers Intermediate School 528, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bea Fuller Rodgers Intermediate School 528 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          84      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

We analyzed the  NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, NYS ELA and Math results in order to determine their level of  English proficiency and Math levels.  By determining their proficiency level we are able to  effectively differentiate instruction and meet the needs of the students.  The majority of students  involved in this program are struggling in ENL and/or Literacy and math.  Schedule and duration: Title III will be used to provide after-school supplementary instruction  for the ELL students presently in 6, 7 and 8 grade classes in order to enhance, acquire, and  expand academic English in all content areas.   The after-school program services 45 ELLs at all  English proficiency levels and meets 3 days a week  Tuesday (4:12 – 6:12 PM), Wednesday  (4:00 - 6:00 PM) and Thursday (4:00-6:00pm)  for two hours each day. The After School  Program runs from October 1 through the first week of April lasting 22 weeks. Students  participating in the programs receive instruction in English Language Development and ELA –  listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills from certified ENL teachers as well as instruction  in Mathematics from a certified Math teacher. These teachers will use English to instruct the  students but will also use students’ native language for clarification purposes. The ENL teachers  will be supported by the content area teacher.   Subgroups: Breakdown of 3 classes:  One class is made up of newcomers-at entering and  emerging level students who are Spanish dominant in 6,7 and 8 grades. While the other two  classes are made up of students at transitioning, expanding and commanding levels of English  proficiency.   Students receive alternate instruction days, two days of ENL instruction and one  day of mathematics.

All departments have common planning 3-5 times a week, during this time they come up with protocols, strategies and  materials  to access the students within their content area. Each common planning day is designated to a specific Teacher  Leaders ensure new assessment protocols are implemented and they lead learning walks with teachers, specifically looking for  ways students are being formatively assessed in class. Engagement Protocols (4-5 Kagan Collaboratve learning protocols) are  implemented schoolwide.  Anchor charts delineating the protocols are in every classroom. Weekly Assessment day by  department (i.e math on Thursday, ELA on Friday)Common rubrics, ways to provide feedback (glows and grows) , anchor  charts, resource bins, strategies (RACE and SOLVE) and checklists are used throughout the departments.Do nows and exit slips  are part of every teacher's lesson plan in order to assess prior and newly acquired knowledge. Teachers walk around  monitoring conversations with a clipboard writing down anecdotals or using an engagement tracker.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Benchmark/baseline Assessments :  We evaluate the success of our program for ENL students through     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data has been gathered, teachers take part in inquiry protocol within their departments in order to analyze  data.  The findings are used to adapt the curriculum, group students, and modify instruction to better fit the students' needs.    The inquiry team is also using the Data Wise process to analyze a wide range of student data to  come up with instructional  improvements to student learning.  Similarly, Assessment Matters is being used in teacher teams to  identify and implement  common assessments aligned to the CCLS, refine instruction based on analysis of data, and work together to continuously  improve their practice.    The use of the different school-wide inquiry protocols to analyze student assessment (such as Engagement tracker)  creates a  common platform for tracking student progress and knowing which students must be re-taught a specific skill in the form of  small group instruction.          5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our classroom teachers provide RTI through classroom instruction by building background knowledge information by starting  each unit with rich text,  and big ideas to connect student's background knowledge and support, by previewing key concepts  and challenging vocabulary connecting them with cognates and/or providing visuals to build on their knowledge.              6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          98         The NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELL Data Analysis Tool, NYS ELA test, iReady and Ready.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In September, the lead ENL teacher provides the entire staff with an email and hard-copy document  listing current and former  ELLs, along with their NYSESLAT  proficiency level for the past two years.  For ELLs newly admitted, the NYSITELL score is used  to determine their initial identification as well as level.   This is updated throughout the year.   The NYS ELA and math scores are disseminated at the beginning of the school (or when they become available to the school)  year via email as well a the Item Skill Analysis in order to make adjustments to the curricula and differentiate  instruction.  These findings are also used by the Inquiry Team to determine trends in students' achievement, to determine why  trends occur  and how to improve uncovered weaknesses  iReady diagnostic assessments are immediately available to all staff members through the iReady website.  This way teachers  can determine which are the areas of strengths and weaknesses for each student and determine which lessons will be assigned  or reassigned.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Currently, the ENL teachers utilize both the standalone and integrated ENL instructional models.  All classes are by  grade level, travel together as a group throughout the entire day, and follow a 45 minute period scheduling.  In  classes with ELLs, students are of mixed proficiency levels.    In order for all of our students to receive all of the mandated hours, we have to carefully schedule the students. For  example, the majority of the 6th and 7th grade ELLs are in Class 603 and 703, bilingual classes. While the largest  number of ELLs or former ELLs in the 8th grade are in 803.   These students receive over 360 minutes of ENL  instruction per week,  which is more than the CR Part 154’s mandated number of units. The principal values the ENL  program; so students  receive more than their mandated services.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     This year, our TBE program expanded to one bilingual 6th grade class and one 7th grade bilingual class.  The classes  travel together as a group and follow a 45 minute period scheduling .   The classes are heterogeneously grouped since  they are composed of ELLs at different English proficiency levels.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   TBE Program  In the TBE classes, Social Studies and Science are the two academic content areas of instruction that are taught in English and  Spanish.  In the beginning of the school year 90% of instruction is done in the home language (Spanish) and 10% in English.   As  the year progresses, instruction moves towards using more English and gradually reducing the home language supports.  Math and ELA  are taught in English with ENL scaffolds and home language (Spanish) support.   These ELLs also receive  Computer Science, Health and PE in English with ENL scaffolds and home language support.  Integrated ENL   All core content instruction is delivered in English with the use of instructional approaches and methods mentioned below, as  well as home language support to make content understandable to ELLs.   Instructional approaches and Methods-       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    HLA Quizzes and Tests: ELL  students take a Home Language Arts quiz in order to assess the skills, ideas and knowledge taught  the previous weeks.End of unit  HLA Essays (writing piece): At the end of each unit, ELL students are prepared to produce a  Spanish essay in a different genre.  Student Conferencing: This is a one-on-one ELL and HLA teacher communication to discuss  a current or recent assignment. The ultimate goal is to help ELLs  improve their speaking skill which is one of the modalities  assesses in the NYSESLAT. The conferences serve to discuss HLA assignment expectations and how well the student is doing in  meeting these. This facilitates learning because students can ask questions in a private manner, it allows them to see and  correct their own errors, and it gives ELLs personalized instruction to improve.Observation: The HLA teacher observes and  records students' level of engagement, academic and/or affective behavior; develops a plan of action to support that student;  implements the plan; and continues to record observations to determine its effectiveness.HLA Portfolios- A writing and  assessment portfolio is used to create a record of student’s growth in Spanish literacy. The teacher collects evidence of a  student's progress in developing writing skills.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   There are many instructional strategies that are used with ELL- SWDs that help provide access to the content as well as  accelerate the English language development such    Instructional Strategies-    Grade Level Material     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          100      Our school uses curriculur, instructional, and scheduling flexibility for our ELL-SWDs by having the students work and learn  with other ELLs who are in the general education program. The ENL teacher both pushes in and collaborates with ELA /Special  Needs teacher.      For students in general education, ENL teachers provide the students with the mandated amount of minutes using the stand  alone and integrated model. In addition, the hearing specialist, speech therapist, and other support services collaborate with  content area teachers . These teachers plan for next instructional steps and discuss the progress of the ELLs in the special  education program.    Our building’s guidance counselor and Special Education Lead teacher notifies all personnel of the students who have special  needs and how to accommodate their needs in the classroom. They also ensure that all teachers have access to SESIS and that  they receive professional development.    ENL teachers participate on the ELA, AIS and ICT team on an as-needed basis, to represents the ELL population.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   For our newcomers, the students are provided with additional Spanish support via small group instruction  after school.   They  are also buddied with a partner that is proficient in English and the home language to help them get to know the physical  building as well the routines and procedures in place at school and in each class.MathematicsIn Mathematics, ELLs at all levels  are instructed daily with the CMSP math curriculum.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Next year we are opening an 8th grade bilingual class to accommodate our current ELL population.     We will continue to improve our parent workshops by tailoring it to meet their needs as per the parent survey.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs have equal opportunities to participate in our after school and supplemental services.  We offer a variety of academic  programs as well as extracurricular activities and clubs that help support ELL students' social emotional well being and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          101      language development in school.     Furthermore, during our holiday and summer institutes, not only do we offer our ELLs the opportunity to be part of our  Academic Enrichment program in where we offer them extra support in Math, ELA, and align field trips to teach students and  parents of how to use all the wonderful academic resources NYC offers us.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classrooms have smartboards and elmos, and teachers are expected to use powerpoint presentations that target the  different learning modalities.  Our school uses iReady for ELA and Math.  Two to three periods per week are dedicated to  iReady.CLose Reading of Complex Text for ELL AIS Our school also offers a set of 30 laptops per floor available for teachers to  use during work stations.  Teachers use digital learning activities to ensure they reach to our ENL students.   Our school also  uses BrainpopESL, Brainpop,  Assessment Matters (Mastery Connect) and Flowcabulary as  digital learning tools used in all  content areas.  After receiving a reading level, our school provides our students with books on their reading levels.  All ELA  classrooms have a library in where students can have access to books at their level.  One of the classrooms where most  ELLs receive ELA, bilingual and ENL instruction has a library with bilingual books, Spanish books and ENL books. Use of  iPortfolios acros all content areas. Our newly remodeled school library includes books in Spanish for our Spanish speaking ELLs,  as well as ENL books.  Incorporated a new reading curriculum, Expeditionary Learning which includes reading materials and  scaffolds for ELLs.  We provide adapted versions of text for ELLs at emerging, entering, and transitioning levels. Wordlywise- direct academic vocabulary instruction that develops the critical link between vocabulary and reading  comprehension. Engage NY website for resources (Expeditionary Learning) ELA rubrics are written in student friendly  language. Movies or cartoon clips of short stories, plays and books are shown to students to enhance text understanding.  All  students have google accounts in order to share work with teacher as well as other students.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   TBE (6th and 7th Grade class)  ENL- general education      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The school ensures that all required services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels because we use materials  aligned to the CCLS.   All instructional materials used in the core content areas and during interventions are suggested by the  NYCDOE such as Passport in Social Studies, TCRWP, Expeditionary Learning, the Science curriculum, Ready, iReady, Engage NY,  and Assessment Matters materials and assessments.   Other intervention programs used, such as Wordlywise and  NYSESLAT practice materials from OSA,  are also aligned to  state CCLS.     iReady is meant to meet students at the math and reading levels after providing a diagnostic assessment. After that  assessment they are provided personalized differentiated instruction and assessments.     CMSP is designed to provide underachieving math students with a basic skills in math.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The schools doesn't share a building with anyone,  but we do coordinate efforts with other community schools, CBOs and  other outside organizations.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          106                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bea Fuller IS 528                                                                              School DBN: 06M528  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The methodologies we use in our school to assess language preferenecs of the parent community for both written  and oral communication are the following: First, the ESL Teacher, who is bilingual in English and Spanish, provides  all new admits with a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). The HLIS is available in nine different  languages. The parent complete this survey with the support of our ESL Teached who reads each question to the  parent and answers any questions they may have before they provide a final answer. The ESL Teacher identify the  language of preferece for parents and informs the Parent Coordinator who then, conducts an informal oral  interview to the parent and shares how as a school we provide both oral and written communication in the ir  language. We also use ATS to identify the language preference that parents have in our school. Our school  secretary prints the Adult Preffered Language Report (RALP) to use that document and identify the percentage of  parents who prefer written and oral information given to them in Spanish or any other language. According to the  RALP, 68.5% of parents in our school prefer to receive written and oral communication provided to them in  Spanish, 5.% in Chinese and 31% use English as their preferred language. In addition, stakeholders in our school   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          108      use the Emergency Contact cards as a resource to provide parents with information in their preferred language.  For this reason, all letters and other documents distributed to parents are are made available in the home  languages represented in our student population. Finally, our ESL Teacher and Parent Coordinator collaborate in  scheduling orientations sessions as needed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    One of the preferred  language for both written  and oral communication  other than Englsih is  Spanish. 68.5% of our  parents preferred written  and oral communication to  be provided in Spanish. Our  school counts with several  stakeholders who are  bilingual and who serve as  translators whenever  parents need to be shared  oral information. For  example, the Parent  Coordinator, School Aids,  Paraprofessionals, Principal,  Assistant Principal, and  bilingual teachers in our  school provide these  interpretation services.  Accoding to the RALP report,  .5% of our parents which is  one parent from our school  population prefers Chinese  to be used as the language  to communicate in an oral  and written form. Our  Parent Coordinator is the  person who calls in to bring  a Chinese tranlator to assist  these parents. Our school  also uses the translation  sercvices offered when we  use our automatic phone  system to communicate with  parents using the language  they prefer. In the event  there are no personnel  available, we utilize the  Translation and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          109     Interpretation Unit.

Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to      provide interpretation service(s)?       In order to keep track and gather data  of how many parents and which  parents come to our events, we use  an attendance sheet that can me  found in our Parent Coordinator's  Family Engagement binder to have  access to the number of parents who  participate in our school events.  During the last week of August, we  conduct a 3 day orientation session  for 6, 7 and 8 th grade students. We  assigned a day per grade in where we  devote 2-3 hours to welcome them to  our school community, to introduce  our mission and vison as a school and  to provide them with information  such as our school calendar for the  year and the routines and structures  we have established in our school.  During the first 10 days of school, our  ESL Teacher provides an orientation  session to parents who have enrroled  their children for the first time in a  NYC public school to share with them  and explain to them their rights,  choices and the ESL program we offer  in our school. We also provide  parents with a Curriculum night.  During this day, all teachers in our  school meet with parents to go over  the curriculum, expectations and to  share their contact information in  order to establish an open door policy  with parents. Throughou the year we  meet with parents during Parent-  Teacher Conferences and during our  Parents Nights.

We make sure  that they understand that we are  here to support their children with  anything possible and that we all  share a common goal which is to see  our children become successful  professionals. We also use Thursdays  as a day to communicate with parents  and to invite them to our school to  have meningful conversations in  where we can support each other in  providing our children a safe physical,  mentally and academic environment  at our school and at home. School  stakeholders also use this time to call  parents to embrace students'  progress and to share next steps in  order to continue building our  children capacities. All school  stakeholders keep a log to record the  name of parents, phone numbers  ,and the reason why thei met with the  parents or call the parents to refer to  it as a tool to follow up with next  steps.            3.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, we use our NYC Doe School  Survey- Parent Responses sessions, The American Institute for Research (AIR) Report and the feedback provided  during our Quality Review under the Strong Family-Community Ties. Teachers and Administrators also share their  data, and their noticings to enhance the services we have in place in our school.         2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          113
