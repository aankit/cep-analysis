This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Barbara Esselborn School, a community of all stakeholders, children and adults., will work together to provide a  learning environment that is safe, caring, and nurturing.   Each child will actively and responsibly seek to achieve their academic, emotional, and physical potential, with the  support and guidance of all staff members. All students will be empowered to take ownership of their own learning,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      monitor their progress, and identify their next steps. We will continue to utilize all community resources and engage  in community partnerships to ensure the cognitive, creative, and social emotional growth of every student.   At P.S. 53, we will continue to seek new and innovative instructional approaches that are appropriate to students'  diverse learning styles.

P.S. 53 is a Leader in Me, Lighthouse School that is filled with students who are responsible, respectful, and creative,  who show initiative, set goals and meet them, who appreciate diversity and cultures and who can resolve conflict and  solve problems. The staff and students aspire to achieve this daily by sharpening our skills. We provide parents the  opportunity to attend our Student-Led Conference to discuss their child’s progress. Students track and monitor their  academic goals, reading levels, math assessments, attendance and celebrate their accomplishments. Furthermore,  the Lighthouse Team is charged with the task of building capacity to ensure all stakeholders provide full  implementation of the Leader in Me program. Buddy systems are in place for Kindergarten and 5 th Grade students, 1  st and 4 th Grade reading buddies, 3rd and Pre-K buddies, and monthly Student Theme Days.    Students assume many leadership roles in the school such as lunch, morning and recycling leaders. The Student  Lighthouse Team provides our students the opportunity to welcome, encourage and develop partnerships with  businesses and Community Based Organizations. Students are provided with an abundance of leadership  opportunities in designing and leading initiatives, and give students responsibilities for leading community service  projects. All students are provided the opportunity to apply to Leadership jobs to promote roles and responsibilities  within our school. For example, Technology Expert, Science Lab Assistant, Stage Squad, Art teacher in training, Pre-K  Technology Assistant, Physical Education Posse and Greeter Leader are the positions available.      The school’s goal is to promote effective academic and personal behaviors for students to meet and exceed. Students  take ownership of their learning through questioning and discussion, aligned to teachers reflecting and revising their  best practice to support students. School leaders hold high expectations that all students will meet the Common Core  Learning Standards. Resources and supports are provided for all teachers to meet these expectations.   Our professional Learning time on Monday is differentiated based upon the needs of the staff and is led by teacher  leaders, as well as school leaders. One particular structure we have in place during Professional learning is ensuring  time for both vertical, as well as horizontal team collaboration. This ensures key learning and best practices are  shared among all teachers/grades.   As part of the daily schedule, we have utilized the first period for teachers to work with targeted groups of students  for academic intervention, guided reading groups and enrichment.

They understand this means adapting new ideas, revising curriculum maps, strengthening their  pedagogy and deepening their understanding of the CCLS. School administrators have identified the need to  strengthen inquiry work. Through out the 2017-18 school year and continuing into the 2018-19 school year, using the  Impact Team model is at the center of each teacher team's work. It was noted in the Spring 2018 PPO, that having  administration monitor and evaluate teacher teams, " will enable you to focus on helping teams make purposeful  adjustments to support the expectations of the Common core. By monitoring the efficacy of teacher-team work and  observation feedback, it will help to build coherence with the use of effective teaching practices used across the  school."   On the 2017-18 NYC School Survey, 93% of teachers say, "they had opportunities to work productively with teachers  from other schools on professional development."

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Barbara Esselborn School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Barbara Esselborn School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program.

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.

The children will be studying Henri Matisse and using him to inspire their  own creativity.  For the ELL students it is very important to make teaching and learning  culturally relevant and to build upon prior knowledge.  Research has shown that integrating the  arts into our teaching makes learning relevant and meaningful.  The arts will create a bridge  between the spoken and unspoken language, support creative thinking and self- esteem within  our students.      The rationale for this program comes mainly  from our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test as  well as the ELA and Math citywide exams.    We presently have 63 ELLS and FELLs (5  entering, 8 emerging, 8 transitioning, 25 expanding and 17 commanding). In the Spring 8 current  students took the ELA citywide test(2=3, 3=4,4=1) and 10 took the Math(2=3,3=4,  4=3).Research has shown that incorporating the arts into early childhood learning makes them  more enthusiastic learners.    We hope to increase the enthusiasm for learning.     This program will be offered to all title 3 ELLs, and if there is room in the program, it will be  offered to our FELLs who have tested proficient within the last two years.  It will run for a total  of 18 sessions on Thursday afternoons when school is open.

We will be studying the author and his techniques for painting by reading and  researching him in trade books and on the internet.   The children will also learn basic art  technique from the teachers and attempt to model the style of the artist.  Each subgroup will  participate in age appropriate activities.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?           At P.S. 53 we will be using the  Fountas and Pinnell  Benchmark Assessment System to assess the literacy skills of all  students.  Benchmark Assessments are administered as one-to-one, student-teacher assessment conferences.  For about 20 to  30 minutes, the student reads aloud and talks about a series of Benchmark Assessment books while the teacher observes and  codes reading behaviors .  During this time the teacher will determine learning levels while also gathering valuable information  about the individual's processing, fluency and comprehension.  Benchmaks will be recorded in October, February and June.        This information will help drive instruction and allows the classroom teacher to match the scores with independent reading  levels for each child. The program also offers additional diagnostic assessments  focusing on phonics, word study and  vocabulary.  This component will be used in addition to Orton Gillingham Benchmarks, and the Baseline Writing Performance  Assessment.   We also use PBA's,  Predictives,  pre and post testing, conferences and running records, My-On   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Reader,  Accelerated Reader and Monitoring for Results .         All teachers us the results to differentiate instruction.  Together these assessments will allow us to determine whether our  current teaching practices are successful.  This data will also provide logistical support for implementing any RTI.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?         In September of 2017  PS 53 switched over to Fountas and Pinnell from DRA.  In June of 2017 teachers were given the  assessment kits and trained on how to use them.  Administration is planning professional development to ensure that all staff  has additional training in order to support this program and Orton Gillingham,  which will continue for the 2017-2018 school  year.       Our PPT/RTI team will start up again in September to make sure all students needs are being met.   Meetings are held  monthly to discuss at risk students.  This team consists of administration,  related service providers,  School Assessment team  as well as classroom teachers.       Leadership ensures that the ENL teacher has ATS access to read the results of the NYSESLAT, state tests as well as other ATS  reports.  NYSESLAT results are shared amongst administration, the ENL teacher, classroom teachers and families.  The trends  found across data are shared with the  teachers and used to drive instruction in order to address the needs of the students.  There is also an items analysis for the ELA and Math tests done by the staff.  The findings are shared with all teachers and used  in creating lessons and mapping out curriculum.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       The results of the NYSITEL, NYSESLAT , Writing Performance Task, Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark (October, Febrary and  June),  Orton Gillingham Benchmark and all State exams are relevant assessment tools used to assess the success of our  programs.  Throughout the year our teachers  use ATS reports and STARS to monitor and review students scores , as well as  their own assessments and notes to monitor progress and track growth or lack of.  These are all determining factors of student  growth.          Our RLAT indicates that our students are making progress.  Out of 22 students in grades 1-5 that took the NYSESLAT in the  Spring of 2017  14 of them are meeting AMAO 1 and 4 of them are meeting AMAO 2.  However, many of our expanding  students need additional help to become Commanding. This will be a subgroup that we will discuss in our planning.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?      We have our teacher teams, ELA and math teams as well as a monthly PPT meeting to discuss all of the data.  The PPT team  consists of administration, service providers and classroom teachers.  The team meets monthly to bring up children of concern  and to follow up on previously discussed students.  All student information and data is considered.  A decision is made as to  what interventions will be given to the child.   The interventions listed above are often offered to our ELL students as either small group or one to one interventions to  address certain needs that they may have.  All NYSITEL, NYSESLAT, benchmark/baseline data, teacher evaluation and F&P  scores are taken into consideration when deciding on an intervention.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        For each English language learner who scores below  specified levels of performance on the annual English  language  proficiency assessment, the school must determine the additional support services to provide the student, taking  into consideration evidence such as the following:      Screening is administered to all students for the purpose of establishing a baseline of performance and identifying students  who are not making academic progress at expected rates. Reliable and valid tools are used to evaluate literacy skills.8  Increasingly intensive levels of targeted instruction are provided to address the needs of individual students demonstrating  sub-standard progress in any of the core areas of study.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Progress monitoring provides the opportunity, through on-going checks, to track the progress of students identified as needing  intervention toward meeting learning standards. Data collected as part of progress monitoring are used to make informed  decisions about changes to instruction and/or intervention.  Parent notification is provided in writing when a student requires instruction and intervention beyond what is provided in the  Tier 1 setting. Parents must be notified regarding:  Rationale for moving the student into a higher, more intensive tier;  The amount and nature of student performance data collected;  Interventions provided;  Strategies to be utilized in increasing the student’s rate of learning; and  Parents’ right to request an evaluation for special education services.  Staff members are qualified in both the knowledge and skills necessary to implement all components of RTI with fidelity.       Within the RTI framework for grades K-5, our PPT team and school leaders meet to share data,  and to think objectively about  struggling students,  while discussing quality of instruction within each tier.  We use grade-level planning meetings as well  as  Instructional Team meetings to oversee progress monitoring.  Key information about a child is the basis for the RTI  process.  It is very important to involve different members of the schools community as you plan to effectively implement  RTI.  This way the services provided are aligned to any intervention plans.             6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].                  The data patterns across NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT modalities will have an impact on  instructional planning. Our data  specialist, the administration and the ENL teacher will review these patterns using various ATS reports and the findings from  the ELL Data Analysis Tool.  The Title III AMAOs 1 and 2 Estimator is used to provide the school with information that guides  them in understanding  the progress or lack of for ELLs.  We are currently using this data to target  areas of need in order to  improve instruction for ELLS.   Classroom teachers as well as the ENL teacher will be able to modify instructional strategies  based upon these patterns.             7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?        Administration, the ENL team and teacher teams use ATS reports to monitor progress.  Findings are shared at Impact  meetings and used for  instructional planning.  Data is used for flexible grouping  to meet students needs.  This data will drive  classroom instruction as well as professional development for the year.   Evidence of program adjustments should be seen in classroom visits, planning,  as well as in student work.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                    P.S. 53 offers a freestanding English as a Second Language Program using  Integrated and Stand-Alone ENL  models.  The program is taught by  Erin Lanza, a full-time ENL teacher certified in TESOL, Special  Education and  Common Branch.   Our classes are mixed heterogeneously.  When possible our ELLs are placed in the same class in  order to schedule instruction effectively.  Mrs. Lanza pushes into the ENL classrooms to work collaboratively with the  classroom teachers.  For the children requiring additional pull out minutes there is a pull out group for that level  consisting of 2 consecutive grades.   We will have four  12:1:1 classes in the building this September (K-1,  1-2, 3, and  4-5).  On each grade we have one ICT and a Gift and Talented.  The children are often brought to another classroom  for services.  We presently have 1 ENL child in a self contained, 1 in an ICT and 2 FELL students in the G&T program.              Our Entering ELLs receive  180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL  and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL, totaling 360  minutes per week.   Our Emerging ELL students receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone and 270 minutes of Integrated  each week totaling 360 minutes.  Our Transitioning and Advanced ELLs are receiving 180 minutes of Integrated ENL  each week.  Children deemed Commanding within the last two years are presently receiving   90 minutes of  Integrated ENL each week.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time the schools does not have a bilingual program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time the school does not have a bilingual program.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               Our ESL minutes are provided as per the NYC CR Part-154 by our ENL teacher as a Stand-Alone and Integrated  model.   All ELLs are required to receive a minimum number of units of ENL, regardless of program placement(ENL, Dual  Language, Transitional Bilingual).  All ENL minutes are programmed through STARS.  Administration uses monthly compliance  reports to monitor related services minutes.  All teacher schedules are collected and monitored by administration.  Our school  uses the Individual Student Programming to identify the subjects taught for an official student.     Our Entering ELLs  receive  180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL  and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA  totaling 360 minutes per week.   Our  Emerging ELL students receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone and 270 minutes of Integrated each week totaling 360 minutes.  Our  Transitioning and Advanced ELLs are receiving 180 minutes of Integrated ENL each week.  Children deemed Commanding  within the last two years are presently receiving   90 minutes of Integrated ENL each week.             The grades are designed where there is one ELL classroom on each grade(with the exception of any ELL children in ICT,  12:1 or G&T all).  The ENL teacher pushes into these designated classrooms to work with the teachers to deliver the ENL  minutes during ELA.   The ELA minutes are provided by  the classroom teachers, who have also been trained to incorporate  ENL strategies and methodologies  into their lessons to  ensure that the specific needs of their students are met.  Instruction  will be scaffolded to meet the needs of all students.  There is collaboration with the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers  through planning, discussions as well as sharing of curriculum maps.   Curriculum maps are alligned horizontally and vertically  by our classroom teachers and our data specialist.    All pull out services for children requiring this service are done by the ENL  teacher.                         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         The program model for Ready Gen allows students exposure into deep, complex text with assistance for ELLs.  There are  mini-lessons embedded within each objective to support English Language Learners.  Instructional approaches and methods  are in place to make content more comprehensible to these learners.  There are visual models used to explain specific  vocabulary and to help students expand their understanding of multiple meaning words.  We share labeled  pictures that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      demonstrate the multiple meanings for a word too.  The classroom teacher plans the lesson for the class in English.  With the  help of the ENL teacher lessons are taught and information is presented to the ELLs in a way they can best understand.                    Go-Math is a Common Core based math program which focuses on "Hands On" approaches and problem solving.  It  integrates best Mathematical Practices and engages students in productive struggle.  The online component  immerses  students in an interactive multi-sensory math environment enhancing learning with scaffolded instruction.  It also creates a  personalized learning path for each student. Every lesson models problem-solving thinking which helps build skills and  confidence and leaning. The classroom teacher plans the lesson in English.  With the help of the ENL teacher lessons are taught  and information is presented to the ELLs in a way they can best understand.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        Throughout the year assessments are ongoing (e.g., Fountas and Pinnell, pre and post tests,  checklists,  portfolios,  conference notes, classroom and formal assessments).   Tests are given in English with appropriate  accommodations unless the child is in need of a translated version  or native language glossaries.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status               Our school offers our teachers help and support through workshops, interventions and materials to support their ELLS  regardless of language development, instructional entry point  or how many years they are in the country.  English language  learners can successfully acquire language and content if they are given the appropriate scaffolding and are assessed in ways  that allow them to demonstrate understanding and knowledge.                At this time we have no SIFE children in our school, but one can enter at any time.  To make sure all children get the  appropriate mandates, there are protocols to follow.  Any ELL who has attended school in the United States for less than 12  months and who, upon initial enrollment in such schools are two or more years below grade level in literacy in their home  language and/or two or more years below grade level in mathematics due to inconsistent or interrupted schooling prior to  arrival in the United States needs to be identified as a SIFE student within the first 30 days of school.  Newly identified ELLs in  grades 3-9 who  are at an entering or emerging level according to NYSITEL results should have to go through the SIFE  Identification process.  This consists of an oral questionnaire, a multilingual screener and a writing screener.     In addition to  classroom interventions, programs such as Orton Gillingham, Great Leaps and MY ON reading are some of the things used with  SIFE students  Once a SIFE student is performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level on the annual English language proficiency  assessment, the student's  status as SIFE is removed, even though they may continue to be an ELL.              Our newcomers are being taught language acquisition using various approaches and materials in the classroom, as well as  in the Stand-Alone ENL program.  Some of these approaches include, but are not limited to visual imaging, TPR(Toatal Physical  Response), scaffolding, using realia, props and gestures.  Our ENL program focuses on phonics and beginning language  acquisition with these children.  Newcomer children are supported in the rooms by the classroom teachers, paras in many of  these rooms, support staff as well as student teachers when available.  We currently partner with New Dorp High School in the  Future Teacher Program.   They are also offered the extended day programs, Reading Volunteers and RTI services if  necessary.  Our school helps newcomers families by establishing a connection with home right away.  In addition to the  classroom teachers setting up their ways of communication(web page, REMIND texting, take home folders, etc. ), we offer  support at Back to School Night and a Newcomer Tea to offer support early in the year.   Translation is provided when needed.              For our Developing  ELLS receiving services classroom teachers and the ENL teacher works together to effectively group   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      these students for instruction.  They work together to develop lessons where academic language and literacy are supported in  content areas.  The use of technology to further support these students is also ongoing in the classroom,  in the ENL program  and at home when applicable.  All students are presently using MY ON Reading and have access to a  device in school.  In  addition to the smart boards, classroom computers, Computer Lab,  Library lap tops and individual computers for grade five,  we have purchased many  ipads and tablets.   Many of the computer programs we have purchased can be accessed at  home  as well as in school.            Although we do not presently have any long term ELLs,  we differentiate instruction for them by having the classroom  teachers work with the ENL teacher servicing their children.  Lessons are developed where academic language and literacy are  supported within content areas.  Groups are flexible within the room.  Technology (MY ON, as well as other programs)  is also  used to differentiate levels.            Our Former ELL students(testing out with the last 2 years) have been placed into classrooms with the current ELLs on  each grade. Groups are flexible within the room to accommodate any students that may be struggling.  This way the ENL  teacher can service the FELL students with their 90 minutes of Integrated ENL.   For ICT and 12:1:1 classes other  accommodations and schedules are made to support the children and service them with their 90 minutes of Integrated ENL.                All ELLs and FELLs for up to two years after testing out are eligible for ELL testing accommodations, in addition to any  accommodations on their IEPs or 504 Plans, if applicable.  Schools should determine which accommodations are most suitable  and beneficial for each ELL at the beginning of the school year.  ELLs are entitled to using those accommodations for most  assessments, including those that are teacher-made and state-mandated.  ELLs are not entitled to testing accommodations on  the NYSESLAT.  Schools may provide testing accommodations to ELLs as needed, on all NYS ELA and content area  assessments(math, science and social studies).                         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        Some of the instructional strategies and grade level materials used to teach ELL-SWDs  that provide access to academic  content area and accelerate English language development are building background knowledge by using rich text and big  ideas,  previewing and front loading vocabulary and when possible using and drawing on student's home language.  Language  frames, storytelling and open ended questions are also useful strategies.      Our Ready Gen reading program is a valuable tool which assistsour  teachers in doing all of the above and we  are using Orton  Gillingham in the classrooms.  We ensure that native languages are being supported by providing the children with picture  dictionaries, native language dictionaries and glossaries,  and native language trade books when available.         Technology has also helped to support the native languages.   At PS 53 we use technology to support all of our students.  In  addition to each classroom having a smart board and a classroom  computer, we have computer carts on each floor housing  sets of lap top computers.  Our library also has at least 40 lap tops available for all children to use.  Both  the lab and the library  have their own cluster teacher and are utilized by many classes.     Every fifth grade student has access to their own lap top computer for classroom use and many of our classrooms have I- Pads.   The ENL teacher has been purchasing  tablets each year  for the children to use.  We are currently up to 14 tablets  located in the ENL room.  The entire school is presently using the online  reading program MY ON.  This program addresses the  need of each subgroup.       The school ensures that ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL or bilingual  instruction receives appropriate programs  by  having  the designated IEP teacher review all IEPs and monitor services.  STARS also keeps track of the mandated minutes and  periods for  each child.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?               All teachers adapt lessons to meet the needs of ELL -SWDs.  At monthly Instructional Team meetings various strategies  are discussed and implemented into the curriculum.  When applicable ELL-SWD's are provided with a flexible schedule to meet  their needs.  For example, a 12:1:1 student may be mainstreamed to a general education classroom and a general education  student may be scheduled for ELA in a 12:1:1 class.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                  To obtain English proficiency, the ELL teacher pushes into classrooms to assist the ENL students within the within the  general population.  The immersion helps students to understand the English language  since all instruction is provided in  English.    We try to place children in classes with other children who speak the same language to assist in ensuring the ELL  student feel comfortable.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.      P.S. 53 offers a variety of Academic Intervention Services for ELA and Mathematics.  In addition to the support services  (Speech, Occupational Therapy, Counseling, Hearing, Adaptive Physical Education, SETSS, AIS, PPT, and ENL), we also offer the  following programs in English. Translation will be made available when needed.      *  Great Leaps:  K-5   * Reading Volunteers: K-2   * At Risk ELLs: K-5   * At Risk Speech (SLIP): K-5   * At Risk Counseling (ERSSA): K-5  *  AT Risk SETTS  *  Great Leaps:  K-5  *  Computer Based Programs - language can vary  *  Sun Dog Theatre Program:  2-4  *  Lindamood Bell  *  Handwriting Without Tears (OT)  *  Getting ready to Learn (Yoga)             9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?             At PS 53 we are continuing to  implement the  supplemental reading program Ortin Gillingham into the classroom.  This  program was implemented almost 3 years ago due to an overall drop in reading scores in prior years.   Last year as a whole PS  53 saw a rise in reading scores.  According to Orton assessments it seems that the ELL students in general are benefiting from  this program at a quicker pace than they were using Wilson, our prior phonics program.  Therefore, we will continue to train  teachers  in this method of instruction.   Our classroom teachers  and service providers have varying degrees of training in  Orton Gillingham.  We will continue with the professional development of it this year in order to support phonics and  reading  skills for all students.  We will also continue using MY ON  where levels  are differentiated  for every student.  This allows  the teacher to control and monitor their individual work.           In math we have switched  to the GO Math program.  As a school we feel that Math In Focus is not reaching every child's  needs.  After careful research and consideration by our administration and teams we decided to switch.  Our teachers are  presently using the program and training is ongoing.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?        There are no plans to close any ENL programs this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.           Our ELLs are afforded equal access to all programs that we offer at PS 53.  All of our RTI programs, are offered to help all  of our students in their weakness areas.  Children are offered RTI once they have been targeted for having difficulties in  the  classroom.  They are first brought up to our PPT team who will decide what service would best fit the child.   These  programs not only service many of our current  ELL students, but also our former ELL students.  They offer the students the  additional support that they may need to find success in school.  There is no cost for any of these services.           For the last two years our Title III funding has been used to support an ELL Art program that meets afterschool.    The  program is offered to all ELLs, FELLs and Title III children.   The program is funded through Title III money and no cost to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      families.         The morning care,after school latchkey program, as well as other after school programs are offered to English and foreign  speaking students.  Letters are distributed to the students in school to bring home to their parents, the information is posted  on the website and the teachers use the REMIND text messaging system to remind parents when the letters are due.   Monies  for these programs are secured through a self sustaining program.         Administration monitors the enrollment in all of these programs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.         At PS 53 we use technology to support our ELLS.  In addition to each classroom having a smart board and a classroom  computer, we have a library with more than 40 lap top computers available for the children to use. There are also computer  carts available on every floor.  Technology and  library have their own cluster teachers who see many classes.  Every fifth grade  student has access to  their own lap top computer for classroom use and many of our classrooms have I-Pads.  Our ENL teacher  has also purchased a total of 14 tablets.  These tablets are used in the ENL classrooms as well as in the ENL room for pull out  groups.         Some of the computer programs that we purchased this year are:  My On reading, More Starfall, Samson's Classroom,  Uptown Education, Accelerated Reader, Enchanted Learning, Brain Pop, Brain Pop Jr. and Tumble Books.   Our new math  program has many  supports for ELLs.  One of them is a digital component including an interactive student edition, a personal  math trainer, Math on the Spot Videos, an HMH Player App and a Digital Management System.    Most of the programs are in  English.  However, some of programs and apps  have the option to change to the language.  All ELL subgoups have access to  devices at PS 53 and are currently using My ON.  Other programs vary based on grade level.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?       P.S. 53 only has an ENL program.  Native language support is delivered through dictionaries, bilingual  glossaries, native  language and cultural  libraries, computer software and technology.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      Each of our intervention services are intended to service a certain age group  and grade level.   A child in need of services will  be discussed at the RtI/PPT meeting.  Here the classroom teacher, as well as the entire team(administration, service providers,  Psychologist and Social Worker) will speak about the child and recommendations for additional services or interventions will  be discussed as a team.  If the team feels the child will benefit from some type of intervention the child will be placed in an  appropriate program, and a set time to revisit and monitor progress will be announced.  The time frame is usually 6-8 weeks.  At the end of the 6-8 weeks the child's case will be revisited by the classroom teacher and supporting staff members to  monitor progress.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?      PS 53 has does not share a building or have a co-location.  Pre-K - 5 are housed in one three story building.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).        Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to attend an  orientation with their parents before the start of the school year.   If a child  enrolls during the year we try to pair them with a native language buddy and encourage their parents to involve them in after  school activities offered at the school.      The parent and child are introduced to the parent Coordinator as well as the school Guidance Counselor who can both assist  them with various things during  the school year.   Throughout the year there are many after school and evening activities that  take place at the school. These activities are run by the parent coordinator, administration and teachers.   These are wonderful  opportunities for newly enrolled ELLs to become involved.       The schools supports ELLs when they are leaving for middle school by taking them through the middle school application   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         process and  arranging to have administration  and staff from neighboring middle schools come and speak to the students  about what to expect when they get there.  The students are also brought to the neighboring middle school on a trip  throughout the year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?        We presently do not offer any foreign language electives in the building.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We presently do not have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?               At P.S. 53 we have weekly grade meetings that are held on common prep periods to plan for instruction.  In addition to  these grade meetings we have in house professional development and planning time every Monday afternoon from 2:20- 3:40.  These valuable planning times allow the teachers to collaborate to ensure best practices for all students, and allow the  administration to plan professional development opportunities for teachers in required areas.  All administration,  paraprofessionals, school psychologists, social worker, occupational/physical therapist, speech therapists, secretaries  and the  parent coordinator are included in these professional development afternoons.  Many topics concerning ELL students are  addressed at these times.   In addition to the meetings mentioned above the staff is also engaged in various professional development throughout the  year.

All teachers  in the building have attended and continue to attend Ready Gen, Orton Gillingham and Go  Math workshops.  In addition, the ENL teacher will attend any scheduled borough ELL training,  Instructional Team Meetings,  Ready Gen workshops, The Leader In Me,  ELL Data Collection and Danielson workshops.   She will be attending other  professional opportunities posted on the"I Teach NYC Bulletin".           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.                PS 53 provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English  language  learners.  A minimum of fifteen percent of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed  by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners.  For all  English as a new language teachers(we do not offer  bilingual at PS 53), a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to  language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.   Agendas from professional  development are kept in the Principal's office.  The ENL teacher  also keeps track of her own PD in order to meet the  requirement of 175 hours every five years for state certification.  These records are  in a binder housed in room 336 and in the  teachers file.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?        Tuesday afternoons are mandated parental involvement days.  Parents are invited in to speak with teachers for workshops  and individual meetings.  The content of the meetings  and workshops may vary.   At this time the ENL teacher meets with  individual parents about their child's progress.    If the parent can make this specific day and time the ENL teacher will  accommodate them at a different time.   If the parent requires translation or interpretation services, they will be provided.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                  Records are kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents as well as outreach to ensure parents needs are  accommodated in the student's cumulative record. The ENL teacher keeps sign in sheets for meeting as well as copies of all  ELL-related documentation, including dates and times of phone calls and if translation services were required.  The ELL-related  documents must be forwarded to DOE schools upon transfer to another DOE school.               2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.       At PS 53 we encourage parental involvement.   We are presently using our Tuesday afternoon parental involvement days to  meet with parents individually and to hold workshops for them.  Each teacher will be conducting one Fall workshop and one  Spring workshop to meet the needs of their students.  Our Fall workshops will be focused on MY ON reading and Orton  Gillingham.  We will be going through the programs with the parents in the small group setting of their child's classroom.  Our  Spring workshops will be designed around surveys that the parent coordinator sends out to the parents to find out what type  of workshops they would be interested in attending.       Our parent coordinator goes above and beyond to reach out to all families and encourage them to join in the school  community.  After establishing the parents preferred language, a translator will be made available.   Therefore, in addition to  back to school night  and parent teacher conferences we offer several opportunities for the parents to be in the building  interacting with the children, parents and staff members.     Below are some of the activities we have at PS 53 for parental involvement:  * Newcomer's Tea  * ELL Orientation  * Book Fair  * Wonderwalk for the March of Dimes  * Halloween Spooktacular  * Open School Week Celebrations  * MY On Workshop  * Orton Gillingham Workshop  *Toy Drive  *Holiday Fair  *Literacy Night  *Family Math Workshop  *Parent ELL Workshops  *Science Fair  *Behavior, Guidance and Discipline Workshop  *Empowering Your Child to Be Healthy and Safe Workshop  *Stress Reduction Workshop  *Learn To Knot and Crochet  *I.S. 24 Orientation Workshop  * Pre-K   * K- Orientation  * Gifted and Talented Orientation       The parent coordinator reviews forms, surveys and other school documents to evaluate the needs of all parents including  ELLs.  When necessary, translators are assigned to assist parents with any need that may arise.  The parent coordinator may  bring those needs to the attention of the school administration.  All of the items listed above are made available to all students  or parents who attend PS 53.  Should a parent contact the parent coordinator, administration or teachers, every effort is made  to provide translation to all parents.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.          At PS 53 we have been working on incorporating more of the Arts into our curriculum.  Starting in September 2017 we will now  have a full time Visual Arts teacher instead of an F-Status one and a full time Theatre Arts teacher.   In the Spring of 2017 our school  applied for a Photography Grant focusing on ELLs and SWD.  The grant was written by Our Visual Arts Teacher and our  Principal.  We chose to partner with Sundog Theatre since we have had success working with them before.                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Beth Albano, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Barbara Esselborn School                                                                              School DBN: 31R053  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registering students, parents are given the New York City Department of Education's Parent/Guardian Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS) which includes an interview with the students and parents to correctly  determine the home language. The HLIS available in the parent's preferred language and translation and  interpretation is available to make sure the forms are filled out correctly. This will help to determine the eligibility  to take the New York State Identification test for English language learners (NYSITEL). The administration of the  NYSITEL is done by a trained licensed pedagogue. ATS reports are run regularly to see students and parents home  language and LEP status. We use RCPL, RHBG,RECF, RCON, RAPL and RADL to generate language reports. All  preferred language of communication is put on the emergency cards and in ATS. The surveys conducted by our  school are the Learning Environment Survey, Lighthouse Leadership Survey, and Parent School Community  Survey.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                          2.
