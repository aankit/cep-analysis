This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of QUMS is to provide a safe, vibrant environment for authentic, rigorous learning of the highest quality  that provides extraordinary experiences in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics  (STEAM) and nurtures a spirit of excellence in all of our middle school scholars as they prepare for high school,  college, and careers.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Queens United Middle School (QUMS) is a middle school in the Laurelton neighborhood in District 29. We are co- located with 29Q156 (a Pre-K through 5th grade school). The school was founded in 2013 with the intention to  educate our scholars through a holistic approach of academic, social, and emotional support. It remains our goal to  become a learning community consisting of three core pillars: critical thinking, civic responsibility, and high school,  college and career readiness. In the past, QUMS partnered with organizations such as Turnaround for Children,  Expanded Ed Schools, and MSQI (Middle School Quality Initiative).    At present, QUMS engages in the following partnerships:     The Child Center of New York-- provides School's Out New York City (SONYC), an expanded school day   program which includes Common Core-aligned curricula with a focus on literacy, citizenship, and enrichment  electives.      Counseling In Schools-- provides a drama therapist who works with assigned students twice per week.    100 Schools Project-- provides resources to students and families coping with trauma, disruptive life events      (i.e. homelessness), and other significant issues.  Long Island University- Post-- provides guidance counseling interns who work with assigned scholars 4-5 days  per week.      As of July 2018, QUMS has a new principal. Together, we will work hard to meet and exceed expectations in four  major areas at QUMS: 1) student achievement, especially in mathematics; 2) positive student culture; 3) parent and  family engagement; and 4) student enrollment.   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.     17% of our scholars have Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs).     7% of our scholars work in a Special Education self-contained setting.    1% of our scholars are English language learners (ELLs).    85% of our scholars enter our school below grade level and in need of intensive support in mathematics and   English language arts (ELA).          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have demonstrated some progress in student literacy rates over the past five years as we have increased our  proficiency by nearly 3% per year. We have also moved over 50% of our scholars from level one to level two in ELA.   Key areas of focus for SY 2018-2019 are:     Establishing a consistently safe, orderly, and intellectually engaging environment for every learner.    Analyzing, assessing, and adjusting our instructional practices to ensure that we are providing Rigorous  Instruction that directly results in substantial and substantive Student Achievement. Although our 2017  Framework for Great Schools score for Rigorous Instruction is 4.03, our score for Student Achievement is 1.54.     Building Strong Family-Community Ties and solidifying Trust among all stakeholders by re-establishing a   vibrant PA/PTA.      Promoting our growth and successful outcomes to all stakeholders in our school community, as well as   families and students at area elementary schools.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q289   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   204   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. Strengths:    The key data points below highlight our strengths that were noted by reviewers or evidence in scholar achievement:   ● Degree of Reading Power: It was cited from the Degree of Reading Power that over 75% of scholars showed growth  in literacy.   ● It was cited in the 2016 Framework for Great Schools Report that the school's Rigorous Instruction score was 3.57.  In the 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report, the school's Rigorous Instruction score was 4.03.   2. Needs:    We need to raise student achievement in mathematics and English language arts to levels that positively correlate  with the perception of Rigorous Instruction as reported by the Framework for Great Schools survey. According to the  School Quality Guide, there have been modest gains in student achievement in ELA from SY 2015-2016 to SY 2016- 2017. However, the overwhelming majority of scholars are not demonstrating the ability to read, write, and compute  on grade level, which is an essential prerequisite for success in high school and beyond. According to the School  Performance Dashboard, the percentage of QUMS students at Level 3 or 4 in math has declined from 15% in 2014 to  10% in both 2015 and 2016 to 7% in 2017. The percentage of QUMS students at Level 3 or 4 in ELA went from 17% in  2014 to 14% in 2015 to 19% in 2016 to 22% in 2017.       Considered from a different perspective, the 2017 New York State testing data show that 93% of QUMS students are  below grade level in math and 78% of QUMS students are below grade level in ELA. To date, complete New York State  testing data for 2018 are unavailable.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Queens United Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Queens United Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by doing the following:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology.     Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children.  Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress.     Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments.     Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand.     Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40         Parental Involvement and School Quality  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:     Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s   Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact.     Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills.     Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact.  Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills.     Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.     Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational   accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home.     Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report.     Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).  Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions.        Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.    Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and   workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Fountas and Pinnell  is used to assess our schools early literacy skills with our ELL's. We have implemented a push-in  model  where students are supported in the classroom with supplementary information, pictures, and vocabulary to assist them in  following and learning the curriculum. Through the utilization of ongoing research and data analysis, the focus will be to  implement individualized and differentiated instruction. The emphasis for the 2017-2018 year will be the efficient infusion of  technological utilization on the collection and disagregating of data to inform instructional decisions with a focus on  literacy.   Instructional planning is guided through data captured from formative assessments and Imagine Learning progress  monitoring reports.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our school follows a data and curriculum calendar that informs instruction throughout the year. Through both formal and  informal observations teaching practice is monitored closely to ensure instruction is informed by assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The evaluation of the success of our ELL program meeting AYP is based upon the results of the NYSESLAT. All four modalities  are individually examined to review growth and how we can address the needs of our ELLs . It is during this meeting where we  determine summer school enrollment and possible ELAND review. Letters are sent to the parents as to their childs proficiency  level and their continuation or non-continuation in the ESL program. In addtion, we use Imagine Learning as a diagnostic to  determine baseline needs of our scholars. This program provides benchmark assessments to track growth throughout the  year.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We currently have Imagine Learning and I -Ready software as programs that are addressing the need for intervention. In  addition, our ENL teacher teaches into any deficiency that is noticed after the analysis of data.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on student performance levels and  our students struggle with comprehending complex statements and higher level  questions. Students understand rudimentary activities and instruction. Their comprehension is limited to simple instruction,  text and familiar vocabulary.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data is presented monthly at our instructional cabinet meetings to reflect on instructional practices, scholar data and next  steps.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.         Instruction is delivered by a certified ESL teacher who pushes-in with students in their mainstream classrooms.  Students are identified by NYSESLAT or LABR score. At the present time, there is a scheduled common planning period  for ESL and classroom teachers to collaborate together. During ELA instruction and targeted enrichment blocks the  following is occurring:  Language and Word Study: The focus on Language and Word Generation is on developing  children’s language and word study knowledge and skills.  Language is developed through high quality literature,  poetry and texts. Poetry is a powerful component of oral language from the start. Academic Language Development  takes place as children investigate language as they speak and hear models of language spoken. *Word Generation –  phonics, spelling, vocabulary across content areas  * Reading: Incorporates guided, I independent, read alouds, literature study. (Use of mini-lessons)  *Writing: Daily writing is as necessary as daily reading.  It is Important to make a reading/writing connection.  a. Guided writing – develop small groups to discuss aspects of writing.     b. Independent writing – student works silently and individually on their own writing.  Daily mini lessons provided   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         based on the needs of the writers.   c. Small group instruction-target academically struggling students within the lesson  d. Enrichment Groups- targets academically struggling students during two dedicated 50 minute blocks weekly     *Learning New Language:  We learn new language in several ways:     a. Conversation – talk with those who provide new language models and interact with us in a way that inspires us to  learn.            b. Experience – we experience something new and stretch to use new language to describe our experience to  others. Talking to others is key. Taking a trip to a new place, we are moved to try new ways of expression as well as  new words, phrases or idioms.   c. Text – written language ability is expanded through text. Importance of Language Reading and Writing are language  based. Using language orally – discussing, sharing, inquiring precedes thinking in writing.     Our focus on reading, writing, and language Development is flexible and can be differentiated to meet specific  student needs. These foci support the academic language development which helps to organize instruction and  learning.  It provides for a high level of language acquisition for the student and fluency in various areas of language     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.           c.  DL program.  If applicable.            2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Intermediate & Begining ELLs  receive 360 minutes of instruction per week while Advanced ELLs  students receive 180  minutes per week. Classroom teachers are provided with more support and staff development to differentiate instruction and  incorporate efficient strategies to meet students needs. Plans are to be developed specifically to support the student in the  classroom. Every teacher of an ELL receives a letter from Mrs. Humphrey with the dates and times in which she will push-in  with the students.      ELA instruction includes 270 minutes of instruction per week. In addition, each student receives a dedicated literacy period  each day, adding 225 additional minutes per week     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity is reflected in many classrooms. The schools has an increased number of students with  diverse needs. Students from  multicultural backgrounds, students from homes in which English is not the primary language  and students with disabilities form a high-needs group more commonly called diverse learners. The diverse composition of the  classroom brings many challenges as well as many opportunities to educators. Teachers can create classrooms that respond  successfully to the needs of diverse learners when they have the knowledge of effective practices and the support of district  administrators, families and community members.  With this said, the way we foster language development and align to the  CCLS is by:   -Creating an environment to show respect for students and a belief in their capabilities.   -Communicate high expectations to all students.  -Be specific in what I expect students to know and to be able to do.  -Incorporate learning experiences that show respect for students as individuals in order to help build self-worth.     Academically the curriculum must meet the expectations of what students should know and be able to do as per the CCLS. The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      following strategies help to meet these demands:  -Build upon background knowledge and experiences of students.  -engage students in active learning.  -foster individual, cultural, and linguistic diversity.  -Promote social interaction.  Our students receive      This is indicative of all content areas. Mrs. Humphrey focuses on building the vocabulary of students through exposing  students to Tier 3 vocabulary across various disciplines. Students are provided support structures (i.e graphic organizers) to  help organize and their thoughts. These methods are in alignment with the CCLS and the CIE as students are required to read  and interpret more complex text across content areas with advanced vocabulary.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Mrs. Humphrey generates a list of the ELL population. This is given to the testing coordinator. The testing coordinator meets  with Mrs. Humphrey to verify list and to access, based on LAB-R an NYSESLAT scores, whether the student would benefit from  the administration of the state test in their native language or in English and if the test is not available in their native language,  a pedagogue to orally translate the exam to the student will be hired. When a decision is made, the classroom teacher and the  principal are notified of the decision. This document is filed with the ESL and testing coordinator.  :        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At risk, special needs, and SETSS services are provided to long-term ELLs & SIFE students. Long-term ELLs and SIFE students  have p specific individual instructional issues to be addressed. They may have achieved conversational  fluency but not  necessarily academic fluency. Effective programming will include a challenging theme based curriculum that will teach  integrated complex thinking across curriculum areas. Collaborative activities will include one on one conferring with the  teacher (ie. dialogue journals), small groups and peer learning activities (such as study buddies) and cooperative learning.  Study skills and test sophistication will be intentionally taught through the use of graphic organizers and varying hands-on  strategies. Each September, during professional development days, specific strategies and tips for effective instruction of  ELL/SIFE students are to be addressed. Addressing the needs of ELL/SIFE students are also included in the teacher’s /staff  handbook distributed to all staff.    ELLs receiving services between 4-6 years follow English only instructional classes which have been designed to improve the  English language learners ability to comprehend his/her core subject areas, through the use of ESL methodologies geared to  meeting the standards. Students are given homework and in classroom exams to evaluate their acquisition of the English  language. All of their written assignments are placed in portfolios for perusing by the student, their teachers, administrative  staff, and parents. Through these tools, students may be properly assessed and held accountable of their academic  achievement or, need of academic assistance. By setting these standards and proving a solid curriculum, the ELL students will  have a successful and positive school experience.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The support for ELLs and special education children include a special education and ESL teacher within the classroom directly  providing reading or writing strategies for these students. For example, the special education teacher may use informational  processing strategies such as charts, graphic organizers, thinking maps or webs to organize student thought and  comprehension.      The ESL teacher may be working with students in a small group initially discussing the importance of food in their own  culture.  This will allow students to be included and participate in the whole class discussion. Students will be able to share   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      their ideas in a smaller group setting allowing for targeted assistance by the ESL teacher. Depending on student levels, the ESL  teacher will provide appropriate scaffold material in the ELLs’ language and provide access to the Internet where translation  software is accessible. Students will grapple with text and re read material multiple times with a different lens each time to  identify different patterns. This will allow all learners to gain a deeper understanding of various components of the text. There  will be ongoing professional development support that target reading and writing strategies like these for all teachers to use in  their classrooms to better meet the needs of the students.      A teacher will adapt his or her instruction to create a safe and supportive learning environment for English Language Learners  (ELLs).  This would include the recruitment of linguistically proficient teachers that can provide translation and small group and  individual support as needed throughout the lessons.  The teacher would collaboratively plan and teach with specialized ESL  service providers. The teacher will adjust the instruction to address the various student levels of language and vocabulary  proficiency.  For example, a teacher would not use a freestanding model of speaking entirely in the target language of English if  the student is new to country with a remedial understanding of the language.  The teacher would change the entry point of  learning to meet the levels of all students.       A teacher would need to explicitly model skills in whole group and small group instruction, differentiating and scaffolding  questions and vocabulary as needed.  The use of visual aids including pictures and the labeling of items around the classroom  would provide comfort to an ELL. Students will be given opportunities in classroom activities to share their customs and  experiences and learn from culturally relevant materials and resources.  This would include differentiated roles within a group  activity where all ELL students are participating in some capacity.      Cooperative learning will exist between students as each ELL will be learning from students on higher levels.  This peer-to-peer  interaction will encourage student solidarity and will empower students to take more responsibility of their own learning over  time. The teacher will thoughtfully group or pair students according to language and vocabulary proficiency.  Teachers will  create learning centers with technology that target language development by way of specific ELL websites and software that  allow students to hear, listen and record their native and English languages.  ESL service providers and classroom teachers will  assess and guide students through the process of achieving English language proficiency.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We have isntructionable instructional expectations which provide ongoing instructional support to ensure  ELL-SWDs  expecttions are met. The curricula ELL's are being provided for oral language and literacy instruction in English. This allows  students to work on different tasks which address the same goal. Teachers will use different resources and entry points to  match the readiness levels of students when working on the same task. Teachers have resources available which reflect a  variety of reading levels for students. Teachers use tiered assignments to adjust tasks to accommodate student needs and  respond to student differences during the lesson by reteaching, reinforcing, and extending the lesson. This methodology helps  our ELLs-SWD achieve their goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Each ELL student is enrolled in a Literacy class or Guiding Reading class which targets reading within ELA.  The school  purchased Study Island, an online program which allows ELL students to target specific standards in ELA and Math that they  need to address.  Within each classroom, teachers target students based on data trackers and address strengths or  weaknesses in standards through small group instruction.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The school will continue with Study Island as an independent way for ELL students to work on standards they are lacking.  The  ENL teacher and content teachers will continue to work together to provide the same instructional focus to ELL students and  make adjustments as they see fit.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      10.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Richard Roder, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Queens United Middle School                                                                              School DBN: 29Q289  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

As per best practices in most schools, within 30 days of a student’s enrollment, the primary language is determined. If  such language is not English, and the family requires language assistance in order to communicate effectively, every  attempt is made for the family to be able to communicate. The school shall maintain an appropriate and current  record of the primary language of each parent.   Information is maintained in ATS and on the student's cumulative folder as well as the emergency blue card. The  school provides translation and interpretation services to all families. It our policy that students and other children  (minors under the age of 18) do not serve as interpreters.    In addition, the schools safety plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access are not  prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      As a new school, we do not have a parent coordinator. However, our guidance counselor has assumed most of those  duties and responsibilities. We adhere to the rules and regulations regarding the posting of signs to remind our  families resources are available to help communicate with our school. These signs reflect various languages which  welcome and direct families to specific contacts, including our Guidance Counselor and District Family Advocate, to  aid in opening the lines of communication between our school and families.Families have access to and are given the  parents Bill of Rights in the beginning of the school year.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school will gather feedback through different modes. Through the citywide parent survey the school will gather  information on how we are meeting the needs of families in need of translation services. Through regular  communication with parents, school staff will ask for feedback in how to provide and assist families. Administration at  the school holds open forums during the school year to gather information that parents are concerned about. All  parents are invited to the open forum.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60
