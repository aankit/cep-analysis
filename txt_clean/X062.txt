This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement    Section 4: CEP Overview      The P.S. 62 School Community in partnership with families will empower all students by providing rigorous learning  experiences and opportunities to build each child’s self-esteem and academics, which will foster leadership,  independence, creativity, and compassion for all. By embracing the whole child, we will instill a solid foundation that  will enable all of our students to meet future challenges and become productive citizens.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P. S. 62 has been identified as a school in good standing. We attribute this to our dedication to our students social- emotional needs as well as our focus on our at-risk population. We utilize the 4Rs program and have developed our  Students Organized Around Respect (S.O.A.R.) program in collaboration with Morningside Center. In addition to our  P.B.I.S. (S.O.A.R.) program we are adding RULER to our instructional program to help our students recognize and  regulate their emotions. Our Parent Coordinator, with the support of our RULER committee, will also offer our parents  multiple opportunities to attend workshops focused on RULER implementation and mental health awareness.    Our School Wellness Committee is continuing its' collaboration with REACH to develop activities and practices that  promote student wellness. This is inclusive of our 5th grade collaboration with Green Beetz (NYC Grows) which  teaches students about healthy eating options. Our physical education teacher is also collaborating with Mighty  Milers to provide resources and activities that introduce our children to fun options for exercise. Finally, our  collaboration with Achievement Lab, Aspira and Team First, our school based CBO's will continue to support our  efforts to provide structured Sports and Arts activities for our children. This year students will participate in  Basketball, Performing Arts, Yoga, Drama, Homework Help, Chess, Cooking Club, Origami, Girls on the Run,  Leadership/Character development as well as ELA and Math support. These organizations will provide our children  and parents with a safe and supportive after-school program that promotes student wellness and character  development.   In addition to the social-emotional and well-being of our students and families we will continue to develop rigorous  instruction across the grades and our programs. The 2018-2019 school year begins with a revision of our daily  schedules. We will utilize a 6 day cycle (A-F days) to increase opportunities for teachers to engage in enrichment clubs  as well as additional R.T.I. support for our at-risk student population. Each grade will have a designated day within  their cycle for teacher teams to meet and analyze student data, utilize small group instruction for ELA/Math to  address student learning gaps and finally use 6-8 week choice cycles for enrichment activities, such as sign language,  school newspaper,    Lastly, P.S. 62 is committed to the academic success of our students. In order to insure that our students receive  rigorous instruction we will continue to partner with various consultants and utilize District and Citywide professional  development to strengthen teacher pedagogy. In 2018-2019 we will partner with NTN to further develop our  problem-solving program and address teacher practice. In Grades K-1, our Universal Literacy Coach will focus on the  implementation of Teacher's College Reading and Writing program with an emphasis on guided reading and data  analysis. Our Generation Ready and I-Ready consultants will support Grades 3-5 in their efforts to use data to inform  their instruction through the lens of small group instruction. All of these supports to enhance teacher effectiveness  and student outcomes will be shared across the school utilizing an inter-visitation model developed and monitored by  the administration and our newly designated model teacher and lead collaborative teacher.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 62 is comprised of approximately 670 students, PreK - 5, 12% of which are in temporary housing and almost 40%  of the population receiving ENL and/or Special Education services. As a result we have put several at-risk ELA/Math  programs in place, such as a departmentalized phonics program to insure that our 1st and 2nd grade students are  given support at their independent levels. We will pilot the HD Word 3rd grade phonics program in collaboration with  NYC DOE. We are also utilizing I-Ready in all grades 3-5 to insure that students are provided with additional ELA at-risk  instruction. The I-Ready data will also be utilized to differentiate our guided reading instruction, further supporting  our special needs and ENL students as they are provided with a customized intervention based on their individual  needs. In addition our ENL students are strategically placed in specific classrooms so our ENL providers can push-in to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      each room on a daily basis during the literacy and/or math block. Students will be placed according to their NYSESLAT  levels enabling the classroom teacher to support the students based on their identified area of need. Finally, our  special education teachers also differentiate instruction by creating homogenous reading groups in 2nd-4th grade,  further supporting our students by addressing their literacy IEP goals across the grades. Our collaborative lead teacher  will also participate in the special education cohort of her program to insure that we are bringing best practices and  rigorous instruction into our special needs classrooms.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 62 has successfully addressed the social-emotional well being of our students and their families. The 2017-2018  school quality guide indicates that our families and staff are confident in our ability to support students, parents and  staff by addressing their concerns and providing a safe and orderly school environment. Our ELA and Math NYS Spring  2018 results affirm that our area of focus continues to be student proficiency.

The 2017-2018 School Quality Report states that Collaborative Teachers is the highest rated area for P.S. 62 4.47,  however when looking at rigorous instruction teachers are stating that their students are unable to respond to  rigorous instruction. This suggests that teachers are eager to work together but require additional support to deliver  quality instruction. In addition, teacher feedback to the professional development team indicates that staff were  eager to participate in PLCs that were relevant to their needs in relation to curriculum support and implementation.   As a result particular consideration to the implementation of new programs will be a focus for the 2018-2019 school  year. The K-2 classroom teachers will implement Envisions math requiring additional supports to insure that all  students are provided with quality instruction.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Our vertical professional development team collaborates to support the  implementation of our new programs and turnkey information to their grade level colleagues. Out of classroom staff  are utilizing the Borough workshops as well as meeting to align their programs to the ELA/Social studies curriculum.  Finally, the ULit coach, model teacher and collaborative lead teacher are meeting with the administration to insure  quality professional development throughout the year.

In 2018- 2019 teacher teams will develop and implement an assessment calendar that highlights looking at student work in  both writing and mathematics throughout the school year.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 62 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      [P.S. 62] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;      provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report      host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the No Child Left Behind Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

After  reviewing our NYSESLAT data it was determined that writing is an area that delays our students  ability to go from Transitional Expanding and Expanding to Commanding.  Therefore we are  preparing a program for our K-2 students that provides explicit instruction in all 4 modalities  with an emphasis on writing.  The 3-5 Saturday program will also address the area of writing  through non-fiction writing with additional support focusing on mechanics/grammar.  In order to  prepare our students for content area writing the students will complete a variety of word  problems with an emphasis on numbers and operations (determined through NYS math and unit  assessments) and provide oral and written explanations of their work.    Our first program will address the needs of our K-2 ELL students.  In order to address the  various sub-groups we will utilize Language Power.  This program will provide direct instruction  in all ENL strands, addressing Entering, Transitioning and Expanding language learners. The  program will be offered from October 17, 2018-April 17th, 2019 on Wednesdays and Thursdays  from 2:45-5:00 p.m.  for a total of 46 sessions.  We will also utilize Title I funding to supplement  our Tiltle III funds to insure that we are able to provide the 46 sessions for the school year. 2  licensed ESL teachers will provide the instruction and a supervisor will support lesson planning  and compliance mandates.  The Saturday program will be offered to students in Grades 3-5 once again utilizing the  Language Power Program to address the various sub-groups within the grade bands.    2 licensed  ESL/Bilingual teachers will work with students to strengthen all 4 ENL strands for 20 sessions  beginning October 13, 2018-April 13, 2019.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our P.S. 62 community is using the data collected during the previous year to determine student program eligibility and inform  parental options. This data is also utilized to organize and place students in the appropriate models, plan instruction, and to  improve student outcomes.  The primary assessments are the NYSITELL, the NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB-R, NYS ELA and NYS  MATH, TC assessments, and the Spanish DRA.  In order to assess the proficiency levels in the native language the school utilizes  various data streams. We use this data to inform us of each child's needs in the native language and help us in drafting  intervention plans for children. Upon registration and when applicable, students are given the Spanish LAB-R test which helps  us identify students early literacy skills in the lower grades. This tool also helps us measure students' proficiency in the native  language in the other grades. We also utilize the DRA Spanish Reading Assessment for the same purpose. We utilize this data  to formulate additional interventions for individual students and to draft instructional plans for the ELL population. For  instance, after conducting initial assessments of new admits, which includes a Spanish reading assessment and writing On- Demand Assessments, the school determined the need for the ENL providers to support students in the area of Writing. This   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      determination was made based on the current trend and the influx of new comer students who have demonstrated  dominance of the first language and our current focus on Writing.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support our school efforts of using formative assessment data to guide our instructional planning we have set the  following structures in place.   The ELL Committee focuses on data gathering, processing and analysis.  The AP for ELLs/Data Specialist and the ELL committee  will fulfill the vital role of informing programmatic decisions and professional development needs to the community at large.  Data will also be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the ELL Program, as well as, patterns across grades both  vertically and horizontally. Finally, data will be utilized to devise strategic planning, taking into account the various proficiency  levels of the students. Instructional decisions such as RTI, grouping of students, planning and utilization of resources will be  informed by both hard and soft data. The school has also used data in combination with the new mandates to reorganize the  ENL programs by concentrating most ELLS in specific classes to facilitate ENL services and to better address their observed  needs as per NYSESLAT scores.      For example, the following data gathering methods are applied structurally to support this effort.   * Upon registration and when applicable, the ENL Registration team first identifies eligible students for testing and  the NYSISTELL is immediately administered. The Spanish LAB-R is also administered if necessary within 10 days of registration.  This information is reviewed by the ENL coordinator/ AP in charge of ELLs and provided to the classroom teacher.   * The TC Reading Assessment in both English and Spanish are conducted three times in the year to measure progress.   * Pre and Post On-Demand writing samples collected and analyzed for all 4 major writing units. The ENL Writing rubric is used  when students begin making the transition into English.   * Pre and Post Unit assessments are administered at the end of each unit. This information is gathered and analyzed by the  classroom teachers and Teacher Teams.   * The teachers also conducts on-going assessments such as conferencing to actively measure student progress.    These and other data sources are analyzed and the ENL coordinator and the classroom teachers collaborate in drafting plans  to better service the ELLs. For instance, the classroom teacher and the ENL coordinator discuss how to best use  resources such as imagine learning and Myon on a daily basis in order to support students at different levels.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The following summative assessments are used at our school to identify students' skills, their progress, and areas of need:  * NYSESLAT (Increase in proficiency levels within modalities)  * Performance on standardized state tests.   * Performance on the Spring and Fall ELA and Math Benchmark Assessments   * NYSITELL, The Spanish Lab-R, and NYSESLAT Results  * The NYS ELA & Math Performance tasks in grades K-5  * ELL Periodic Assessments (Schoolnet)  * Pre & Post Unit Assessment in Math   * On Demand writing assessments                               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In order to provide additional and more targeted support to our ELLs our school ensures that summative assessments ae  gathered and analysed.  First, both the classroom teacher and the ENL provider gather data on the student and articulate  information for both individual and groups of students and their progress.  Student progress is determined and next steps  delineated.  The ENL provider and the classroom teacher then plan for instructional modifications and areas of focus at the  classroom level and as Stand-Alone. When further concerns arise and when appropriate, the classroom teacher refers the child  to the RTI Committee for additional intervention. In turn, the child's profile is discussed and a plan is drafted. The plan may  include suggestions may ranging from Tier II or Tier III interventions, use of additional resources, or increase in services. If  needed, the team might make a suggestions for further evaluation.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S. 62 has identified several data sources to determine when an ELL student is in need of RTI support as well as the type of  intervention provided.   We work to determine if the child has a language acquisition issue or a learning disability.       We begin to assess all ELLs new to our school with the NYSITELL and the Spanish LAB-R to determine if ENL/Bilingual  instruction is appropriate.  Once the children are placed in the appropriate program a series of Native Language and ELA  assessments are given to determine language proficiency as well as content knowledge.  o  P.S. 62 utilizes the Teacher’s College Assessment and the Spanish DRA to determine reading levels.  o On-demand writing assessments are also given and the ENL rubric is used to measure student proficiency in     English.  Native language responses are also scored and analyzed.  o The unit assessments for the NTN program are also utilized.  • Baseline data is assessed by the ESL providers and classroom teachers to determine student needs and proficiency levels.  •  Benchmark assessments are given at various frequencies to monitor student progress.     The NYSESLAT is utilized to determine student progress for all ELLs with 1 or more years in addition to the above.  • All staff working with ELL students are provided with data to determine language proficiency in all 4 modalities; listening and  speaking/reading and writing     These data sources are utilized to determine if interventions are necessary and what RTI Tier to provide.  Students making  progress in native language content area may be provided with additional Tier 1 support for language acquisition, whereas  students making no progress in native language and/or English proficiency would be provided with Tier 2 and possibly Tier 3  interventions as determined by the ELL-RTI committee.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In order to best inform our program choices and their impact we employ a variety of assessments.  The success of our ELL programs will be measured through:  •    Setting interim benchmarks for student performance  •    Increase in proficiency levels within modalities  •    Performance on standardized tests  •    Increase in reading levels as measured by TC assessments,  •    NYSESLAT results  •    Teacher conference notes  •    Formal and informal observations    Key Assessment data sources such as the NYSITELL and the RLAT have been analysed to evaluate and better inform our  program. For example, NYSITELL scores analysis suggests that most newcomers in grades K-5 scored at the Entering and  Emerging levels across the grades with a  few scores distributed among the various proficiency levels.  Comparative data  between 2014 and 2015 shows that scores went down slightly in the various modalities while fluctuating in 2016 based on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         testing at a higher/different Testing band.  This is in part due to recent changes to the exam in 2015.  As previously stated,  2016 NYSESLAT data suggests that students within a testing band are showing increase while showing less growth when  they test at a higher different band. For example, students who tested in First grade showed a significant increase when they  tested again in Second grade. However, they experienced less growth when they tested in 3rd Grade.  In grades K-1, data  shows that students have shown growth in the Listening, Speaking, and Reading sub-tests.  Writing seems to be the area  where students need further support and reinforcement. In grades 2-5, The areas of Listening and Speaking seem to have the  most growth.  Data suggests that  students are struggling in Reading and  Writing.   This pattern continues as students move up  the grades with the exception of the usual influx of newcomers during the year. These students usually score at the lowest  level of proficiency as per the  NYSITELL and subsequently the NYSESLAT since they are first year ELLs from other countries.       As previously stated, writing has been recognized as the area of focus as per the NYSESLAT results; and for this reason,  the school refocused the ENL program around writing. The ENL teachers provided integrated support during the writing  block and their program has been readjusted around this subject area. All other school program and schedule revolve around  the ENL providers' schedules.                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to make these findings public our school utilizes the following structures.   * The administrative team takes a first look at the released testing data and makes noticings about individual students, grade,  and school-wide trends.   * We then conduct data meetings with the ENL Providers to further discuss the data and observed trends.   * Next steps and areas of focus are discussed and agreed upon.   * The ENL service schedule is created for the ENL providers to reflect the area of focus. Subsequently, all other  programs/schedules are drafted to support the ENL focus and the providers' schedule.   * The Principal introduces and discusses ENL goals for the year, a rationale grounded on the ENL data, and provides an  explanation of the master schedules and how it relates to the ENL program.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At PS 62 we are currently using the Freestanding ENL organizational model to support our ELL population in grades 2- 5.The ENL program encompasses students in 2nd through 5th Grade. Students are grouped by both grade and  proficiency levels in order to ensure that their needs are being met and that instructional minutes are being provided  as per CR Part 154.   We will use both the Integrated Push-In model as well as a Stand-Alone pull out program as per  CR Part 154. Mr. Lawrence will provide both Stand Alone and Integrated Services to students in grades 2. He will  also provide Stand Alone services to Entering and Emerging ELLs in grades 3-5, while Mr. Camacho will provide 2  periods a day of Integrated ENL service to all Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, expanding, and Commanding former  ELLs in grades 3-5. This model will allow us to provide additional minutes to all ELLs in the ENL Program across the  grades.   Ells will be grouped based on their proficiency levels Entering/Emerging and Transitioning/Expanding/commanding.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Due to the recent increase of Newcomers dominant in Spanish in grades K and 1, we have opened a K/1 Bridge  Transitional Bilingual 40% English/60% Spanish which will be taught by a certified Bilingual Teacher and which will  service the Ells in both grades. Instruction will be focused around using students experiences and knowledge to  strengthen their language abilities and proficiency levels in the Home Language. We will simultaneously use the first  language for advancing and transitioning into the Second language.  We will follow the Transitional Bilingual Program instructional time recommendations as per Part CR154 for the  Entering/Emerging stages in order to provide instruction in both Spanish and English in the different subject areas.  Students will be grouped based on their language abilities and grade level.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school provides the recommended times as follows:          Level                  Number of Weekly Minutes of Required ENL/ELA Instruction           Entering                                 360 minutes           Emerging                               360 minutes           Transitioning                               180 minutes          Expanding                             180 minutes          Commanding                                90 minutes    We have created schedules that allow both ENL providers to service the students additional minutes. The schedule has been  organized based on grade level and Proficiency levels in the NYSESLAT in order to ensure that  all children receive at least the  mandated number of ENL/ELA minutes.  Students in grades 2-5 are provided with a Free-standing ENL program model and are  serviced by 2 licensed ENL instructors.      Students in the ENL program will be serviced as follow to ensure the correct number of explicit instruction in ENL and ELA.   - Mr. Lawrence will use an Integrated and Stand-Alone Model a total of 9 times a week during ELA instruction for ELLs in  grade 2, providing at least 360 minutes as mandated by Part 154 in English Language Literacy Instruction while integrating ENL  and ELA.  - Mr. Lawrence will provide Stand-Alone ENL/ELA and content support to Entering and Emerging ELLS in grades K, 1 for  students not placed in the TBE class.  In addition, he will provide 180 minutes of pull-out support for students in grades 3-5.  - Mr. Camacho will use the Integrated Model to provide ENL/ELA instructional support to ELLs in grades 3-5 to ensure that the  additional mandated instructional minutes are provided.      ELL students in grades K and 1 will be serviced through a TBE program model taught by a certified Bilingual Education teacher.  The Transitional Bilingual Program will follow the instructional time recommendations as per Part CR154 for the  Entering/Emerging stages, representative of the students in the class,  in order to provide instruction in both Spanish and  English in the different subject areas. Language art instruction will be delivered through a balanced literacy approach inclusive  of phonics and guided reading.  Students will also engage in daily 45-minute periods of HLA instruction to total 225  minutes per week, instead of the recommended 180 minutes. Also Math instruction will be conducted in the home language  on a daily basis.     How are instructional minutes delivered?  ELA:         - Literacy Workshop/Writing:  60 minutes in the Reading To Learn Academy                                                            120 Minutes in the Learning To Read Academy         - GRAIR: Guided/Independent Practice: 30 minutes     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ENL:        - Listening Centers 20-30 minutes per session        - IMAGINE Learning Instructional software: 20-30 minutes daily        - Integrated/Stand-Alone: 1-2 periods daily     In addition, a 45 minute special/enrichment period provided in English is also included each day to all ELL students. The  specials vary by class and may include, Visual/Performing Arts, Science, Physical Education and/or Math Enrichment.  These  classes employ ENL strategies such as TPR, repetition, vocabulary development, use of sentence frames, and visual aids to  insure that students are able to communicate and comprehend in English. In addition, All ENL classes infuse ENL strategies  throughout their day in all subject areas.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Social Studies     The school is currently implementing common core aligned units which infuse both content and Reading and Writing  strategies. During the literacy block, the teacher presents non-fiction texts for Shared Reading, Read-Alouds as well as for  Independent Reading. The language of instruction for the ENL students will be English. Units of Study are planned to include  non-fiction writing and reading and the teachers use an interdisciplinary approach already embedded within the new  instructional programs. The students are required to work in groups and their tasks and assignments are project based, with  the four modalities always considered and outlined.   PS 62 is working towards including language objectives as well as content  objectives in all lesson plans when appropriate.      The curriculum has been chosen due to its alignment to the new CCSS and the instruction is tailored to the levels of the ELL  students. The libraries in all classrooms are stocked with books in the students’ native language (Spanish). Specific teaching  strategies employed will be: role play, use of analogies, jigsaw learning, as well as extensive use of graphic organizers. PS 62 is  focusing on adding resources that are authentic and culturally sensitive, thus providing primary documents as much as  possible. Students are encouraged to share their culture and contribute their family/country customs, so that they feel  honored.     Science      PS 62 uses an inquiry approach to teaching Science.  The teachers are trained in delivering hands-on lessons, where students  have an opportunity to observe, hypothesize, record, and predict information.  Additionally, the school has two science  teachers and a science lab which is utilized to deliver instruction to ELL students in grades 2-5. Students will work in  collaborative groups that will facilitate accountable talk. Teachers use technology such as SMART Boards to make the learning  more interactive and engaging. The language of instruction is English and ELLs are supported by scaffolded lessons that allow  them to demonstrate their learning through real-life applications. Teachers will ensure that hand-on activities – Kinesthetic  (TPR) learning events – will provide an excellent learning environment for English language learners. Class trips are also an  important part of the science program at our school. Also, the school is following the mandate of teaching for STEAM science  unit in which Ells will be grafted full participation.      Furthermore, the classrooms are equipped with charts, visual aids, tools and technology that create an interactive  environment that becomes part of the learning process. The language of instruction is guided by the program model.     Math   All classrooms have both English and Spanish student materials to support the ELL student. Teachers set up learning activities  appropriate to students mastery levels as well as language proficiency levels in order to address the need of all learners,  including those of the ELL students. Manipulatives and other realia are used to help students understand the mathematical   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      concepts by focusing/grounding the learning in realistic situations. Word walls will be employed to teach mathematical terms,  along with the glossaries, and symbolic representations. Students will work in collaborative groups or in pairs to solve word  problems. Teachers will scaffold instruction by presenting word problems in simpler, clearer, shorter sentences. Teachers will  also present one content objective using a variety of process strands, in their efforts to scaffold the learning. The school is  focusing on providing students with tasks and instruction that are differentiated and tiered to give all students an opportunity  to demonstrate their mastery of the concepts.  Math instruction for ELLs in grades K/1 will be conducted in Spanish while in  grades 2-5 Math instruction will be in English.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   At P.S. 62 we ensure that all ELLs are appropriately evaluated by a bilingual Spanish pedagogue by using the Spanish LAB-R  and  the TC/DRA Spanish Reading Assessments. We are actively seeking other assessment tools to measure Spanish proficiency  as well.  Also, teachers conduct both formal and informal assessments in the classrooms such as baseline writings. For those  other languages where a pedagogue that speaks that language is not available we reach out to other schools, parents, and  translation services to provide us with native language assessments.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Differentiating instruction for ELL subgroups:  a. SIFE:  In order to ensure that our long-term ELLs are properly serviced and develop to their full potential, we will provide them with  supplemental services as needed. We carefully monitor the academic growth of these particular students through systematic  data analysis and when appropriate provide additional services.  The school will continue to address students’ needs by providing a more targeted approach. This approach will be aimed at  helping students overcome the language barrier. The school will extend RTI services to these children on an individual basis  and based on each individual student’s proficiency level. These students will participate in all Title III funded activities in the  school. Specific focus will be placed on this sub-population during ELL meetings. Teachers will share their experiences with  each individual student.  To supplement the mandated ENL or TBE program, the following supports are in place to meet the specific needs of this sub- group:  •           Small Class Size  •           MyOn, Imagine Learning, iReady, News ELA(in 5th Grade),              GoMath Materials (English and Spanish)  •           Dictionaries and other resource materials and equipment designed to meet the needs of ELL students  •           Response To Intervention  •           Professional development for teachers which focuses on ESL strategies, scaffolding,  and methodologies to              incorporate into content area instruction  •           Interim Assessments to assess growth and language development  For those students who reach English language proficiency, as determined by the NYSESLAT, we continue to monitor and  support through Extended Day and Technology to support language acquisition and fluency.     b. Newcomers:  Newcomers are addressed in various ways at P.S. 62.  The Imagine Learning program is available to all classroom teachers and  is utilized as a major support for language acquisition. Students receive Literacy instruction in English and ENL Strategies are  infused throughout the day in all subjects.  Spanish literacy and math materials are also available to all newcomers and their  parents. The MyOn reading library resource is also made available to each student. These computer programs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      provide approximately 6,000 books to the students based on interest, and reading abilities in both English and  Spanish.  Additionally, ENL teachers also instruct  newcomers in literacy, totaling 360 minutes per week for students at the  Entering and Emerging levels.         c. The following approaches, programs, and materials are used to differentiate instruction for our English Language      Learners  at the Developing level.  - Literacy Workshop -  - Guided Reading Support   - Integrated/Stand-Alone Services by ENL Teachers  - Imagine Learning, MyOn, Spanish classroom libraries, Listening Centers, computers, etc.  - Math instructional support, small group instruction  - GoMath Spanish Materials  - Afterschool/Saturday Academy       In addition, a 45 minute enrichment period provided in English is also included each day.  The enrichment activities vary by  class and may include; Visual and Performing Arts, Science, Social Studies, Physical Education, Reading and Writing Connection,  Problem Solving and/or Math Enrichment.  These classes employ ENL strategies such as TPR, repetition,  vocabulary development, and visual aids to insure that students are able to communicate and comprehend in English.     ELL Students 4-6 years:  The students that are in need of extended services are provided with specific instruction identified by the 4 strands of the  NYSESLAT in addition to the programs that the newcomers receive. For instance, Imagine Learning, Saturday ELL Academy, and  small guided reading instruction, and RTI services based on need. These programs address deficiencies in decoding or guided  reading instruction for reading comprehension.  All 4-6 year ELL’s are given mandated support by utilizing a variety of  programs, including iReady on-line(in 5th Grade), News ELA, myOn reading Library, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and  Readers Theater to address fluency.  We also provide test preparation strategies in both Literacy and Mathematics.  Materials  include Reader’s Theater, Atanasio Materials, authentic libraries (Spanish and English), and iReady student books.       d. Long Term ELL's:  Once a student has been identified as a SIFE and determined that the student is in need of service, academic assessments such  as Teacher’s College Reading Assessment would be utilized to determine the students literacy level.  A basic baseline as well as  unit mathematics assessment would also be given to identify the students’ strengths and weaknesses.  These students while  lacking academic skills are also unfamiliar with the social structure of formal education.  Therefore, it will be necessary to  provide at-risk counseling to help the student to transition into a formal school setting.  The counselor after meeting with the  student for several sessions would then discuss the child with the ENL providers and the Assistant Principal in charge of Ells to  identify and implement any next steps.  A parent meeting to review the child’s social history would also be scheduled to better  understand the student’s background and open communication between the parent/guardian.  Finally, each student would be  given an individual plan for instruction since each case would be unique to the individual and his/her prior circumstances. This  plan would address the social needs along with the academic. teachers will utilize multi-media and mulit-odal approaches in  their methodology.     e. Former ELL’s:  Students that have achieved a Commanding Level or an expanding level  in both Listening/Speaking and Reading/Writing on  the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT and a level 3 or 4 in the NYS ELA only require .5 units of study per week of ENL service as they are  considered Former ELL's. P.S. 62 has opted to follow the progress of these students and  will continue to provide these services  for two more years to insure that they do not have difficulty transitioning out of their programs.  These students will receive  ENL services, Imagine Learning access, and small guided reading instruction provided by the classroom teacher.  In  addition, students in Grades 3-5 will continue to receive testing modifications for two years after testing out and will continue  to have access to all ELL supports and programs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56               6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All free-standing ENL special education students are included in the same programs as the monolingual general education  students. However, they also receive all mandated services as per their Individual Educational Plan.  The ENL instructor goes  into the classroom to provide additional support for these students during the period in which the student’s IEP identifies an  area of weakness.    The self-contained classroom teachers also employ special education strategies and small group instruction.  The ENL providers  have also begun to create individuals goals for the students based on the data which is discerned through the Imagine Learning  Program, analysis of student work samples, and tools such as the iReady diagnostic/individual student profile and MyOn .   Special Education classroom teachers will have Individual Action Plans based on their needs in order to provide the them with  a better understanding of how to deal with the different learning modalities of their students.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Interdisciplinary grade meetings are held to look at student work to determine student strengths and to plan instruction  and modify curricula. Teacher teams also work with the ENL providers to plan project based learning activities. ENL Providers  have been trained in our ELA(Expeditionary Learning) and our new NTN Math program and actively adjust instruction based on  planning, articulation with the classroom teachers and SETTS providers, and students language abilities.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted Interventions     At PS 62 we have several intervention programs used to support the English Language Learners. For Math, we use the  iReady diagnostic tool as a baseline, mid-line assessment(optional), and end-line assessment. The program generates student- specific and class profiles.  The classroom teachers use this information to match lessons from the iReady books to tailor their  intervention, match lessons to student needs and to group children in order to address the areas of focus. Classroom teachers  also use this information to readjust unit plans. In addition 5th Grade students have the iReady online tool available where  teachers assign specific tasks based on the area of needs identified by the diagnostic test and/or the teacher themselves.   The GO Math online component is another tool available and used to support and enhance the ELL learning experience.  Teachers assign tiered activities to support the ELLs based on their mastery of concepts and language abilities. Teachers of  ELLs also use the GoMath Spanish Student resources alongside the NTN Math materials to better support classroom  instruction.  In ELA, we have the Fundations program available to assist those ELLs with IEPs.  Reader’s Theater is a research-based program  that is used to develop speaking and reading ability. It is used in a small group setting during the push-in time of ENL  instruction. Once again, games are part of our approach to build language. Research shows that games tap into a different part  of the brain that facilitates language acquisition. Teachers directly teach vocabulary words to help students expand their word  base. They then ask students to represent the meaning of these words by drawing. In ELA, our programs (Core Knowledge and  Expeditionary Learning)  utilize a variety of approaches and address various aspects of literacy using a multidisciplinary  approach. The programs infuse both science and social studies curriculum. For example, the Expeditionary learning program  uses social studies trade books for some of their units. Additionally, end of-unit tasks infuse reading, writing, and the content  area. Students also have access to the school's library and the computer room to conduct research about topics studied in  class.   In addition, all ELLs in grades 1-5 are offered an afterschool Title III program to address writing and language proficiency.  We  are currently using Language Power as our primary program as well as What's Your Point, by Tony Stead for opinion writing.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Programs of Improvement  Also, based on parent choice, this year we are going to open a Spanish K/1 TBE class to address the current trends in our  community.   Our 2016-2017 kindergarten class had a total of 11 students identified for ENL services and we are projecting  about the same for 2017-2018 so we will offer our parents both a freestanding ENL program as well as the TBE class.     In addition, we are going to continue to focus on the collaboration between the classroom teachers and the ENL providers to  insure rigorous instruction that is aligned to the CCSS as well as supports for language proficiency.  In order to provide  professional development to enhance classroom instruction we will utilize NYCEBERN and Office of Dells workshops that  address curriculum as well as co-teaching models.     Finally, we will continue to place a greater emphasis on writing and the four units as this continues to be an area of concern as  per the NYSESLAT results and our on-demand writing assessments.  We will continue to provide supports and scaffolds for Ells  in writing development. For example, we will continue to use Spanish-translated rubrics and student checklists for them to  employ while writing. We will continue to promote writing goals and the ENL teachers will continue to provide integrated  support during the writing block.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our school is fully committed to offering our ELL students equal access to all school programs and opportunities. All our ELL  students participate in every enrichment program our school offers (e.g. Visual and Performing Arts, Science,  physical  Education, etc). Additionally, classrooms that have ELL students have Smart Boards, iPads, centers, Bilingual Corners, and  bilingual libraries. In order to enhance the curriculum and provide equal access to our Ells, teachers plan trips to provide real  life experiences that enhance the curriculum. In addition, all ELLs have equal access to the school's programs, technologies,  and services such as RTI.      All ELL students are represented in and participate in all programs offered at our school just as their counter parts, non-ELL  students, do. For instance, ELL students participate in our after school programs, Saturday Academies, Physical Education,  iReady, MyOn, Small Group/Guided Reading,  class trips, awards assemblies, graduation activities, Respect for All Week, the  Olympics, as well as other school activities.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Our school counts on a variety of materials and resources available to our staff  for strategic use in addressing our students’  needs. Technology is used on a regular basis to deliver instruction and to make learning more interactive. Some of the  technology tools available to support the ELLs are: Smart Boards, Document Cameras, The internet, instructional software, a  computer lab, laptop carts, a technology classroom for Specials,  listening centers, iPads, etc.     Additional Materials used for various subgroups are:  - Fundations: for ELLs who are also Special Ed and/or struggle with phonics  - Imagine Learning: Utilized for All Ells K-5  - iReady: Diagnostic tool for grades K-5, iReady Student Books for grades 3-5, & iRady On-line tool for 5th Grade  - News ELA: Grades 3-5  - myOn: Grades K-5  - English at Your Command for ENL small group instruction  - Language Power   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      - Go Math On line Resources         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our school supports the acquisition, maintenance, and development of students’ native language based on the students'  proficiency levels in the freestanding classroom setting. The school utilizes the Spanish LAB-R as the first tool to  assess students language abilities in Spanish. All ELLs regardless of the program model are then given the TC/DRA Spanish  reading assessment to measure progress. Spanish speaking students considered new to our school system will receive  academic supports in Spanish to ensure the academic instruction and learning process continues until they become  fluent English speakers. For example, all classrooms have Spanish libraries to support the native language, classroom teachers  promote and encourage the use of Spanish until the student is ready to start making the transition into English. Classroom  teachers also set up systems and procedures to further support students. For example, teachers use Spanish to address the  children during the lesson and if not fluent in Spanish, a Spanish speaking student serves as a translator.  Additionally,  classroom teachers provide materials in the student's home language to support various subjects.  For example in  writing teachers use translated versions of the writing checklists and allow students to write in their home language until they  are ready to transition.   In mathematics, Spanish additions are sent home to assist parents as the children transition to  English materials as well as in science and social studies.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    PS 62 ensures that all services, resources, and additional support provided to students are appropriate to their age and grade  level by making sure that decisions are made by teams of staff members inclusive of the classroom teacher, ENL providers, and  Special Ed. providers (when appropriate), etc.  This  is to ensure that the experts are included in the decision making-process  so that the school can make better decisions for our ELLs.  In addition our Title III funds are used to purchase materials that  assist with Englsh language acquisition in the classroom as well as funding for our afterschool programs.           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the beginning of the year, registration packets are prepared to facilitate the registration process. All documents  pertinent to the ELL Intake process are prepared, orientation meetings are planned, agendas created, and the video is set up  for the parent orientation. An overall plan is formulated and/or revised where team members are assigned specific roles.     We are now identifying and to testing eligible students who are in Pre-K who are pre-registered for the upcoming  academic year.  The ENL providers are conducting these assessments and contacting parents of identified ELLs. Parents are  being notified and will be invited for a parent orientation session in order for them to learn about their available options and  for them to select the program of their choice.  Our Parent Coordinator also reaches out to the parents to assess any needs the  parent may have as they bring their children into the school for the first time, inclusive of preparing documentation.  Families of students who enroll throughout the year also, are met by the ENL providers and invited to participate in a parent  orientation.  After selecting their program of choice, students and heir parents are invited to meet the teacher. In case that an  ENL student has an IEP then the parents are directed to Speak to the SBST representative to ensure that IEP services are met.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  It is our goal to provide rigorous, quality instruction, to all students, which requires all staff to effectively deliver instruction. To  reach this objective we will continue to focus on and support all of our teachers by providing them with professional  development in key areas such as planning for differentiation, using data for instruction and grouping, best instructional  practices, and use of technology. The school is utilizing the Danielson Rubric and the Common Core State Standards as key  elements in the training and development  of our teachers. The school will continue to offer a menu of PD opportunities based  on teacher interests and identified needs through observations.    The school will use a calendar to schedule all PD learning opportunities for the year.  These menu choices will vary depending  on periodic needs assessments, data extracted from the Advance system, observed needs, teacher requests, new mandates  and expectations, etc. This Professional development plan will also include activities such as Conferencing, Independent  Reading, Guided Reading, ENL Methodology, ENL strategies, and best practices, etc.- All will revolved around Looking at  Assessments, Looking at best Practices, and Looking at the Curriculum.      The preliminary calendar of Professional Development opportunities include the following:   Assessment (MOSL/TC)                                                       September- October  IPC's/Looking at Data NYESLAT/TC                                   September, October, December, March  Best Practices/ELL Committee/RULER                              October, November, On-Going   ELA Focus: Looking at student work-                               October, 2017                       Slicing Protocol  CR-Part154 Mandates & the bilingual Classroom            October, 2017   Grade K & 1  Inter-visitation Protocol                                                      November, 2017  Balanced Literacy:  Grades K-2                                          On-Going                                                Conferencing, Share reading,              Guided Reading, Independent Reading).

Teachers of ELLs will be trained on how to manage and utilize different data sources inclusive of ELL-specific data  streams. Classroom teachers, will be able to participate in professional development activities with the ENL providers during  their common planning time on a regular basis. The school will continue to train all teachers around the new Common Core  ENL Standards. Additionally, teams of teachers are sent to PD opportunities outside of the building in order to learn new and  more effective strategies and instructional practices. These teams will in turn, present this information and provide PD to our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         staff. Teachers of ELL will also continue working with our TDC coach and our NTN, funding permitting, to better plan  instruction for the ELL students in their classrooms.      The ELL team will also  conduct training on-site to turn key training offered through the Office of ELLs. Agendas of meetings  and attendance sheets will be kept on file in order to keep records of training hours. Additionally, copies of Certificate of  Completion will also be kept on file (PD Binder), in the Principal's office, when teachers attend PD outside of our school.      Professional Development opportunities will focus on the following areas:     Common Core Standards                 Co-Teaching Models                 Differentiated Instruction in Bilingual and ENL Classrooms     Language Development Strategies/Language Functions     The NYSESLAT: New expectations, Test format, testing bands, etc.     ENL Standards/The use of ENL Strategies in the Content Areas     NLA Instruction     Focus on LAP Principles     Alignment of Bilingual literacy instruction with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project                         curriculum, including creating corresponding mentor text libraries and curriculum mapping.

In order for our school to meet PD requirements and in order to keep Both Bilingual teachers and ENL teachers abreast of  current research and ENL best practices, the school will continue to conduct professional development focused around  pertinent topics such as stages of Language Acquisition, alignment with core content area instruction, recognizing Language  development Needs vs. Special Ed Disabilities as best Practices for RTI, ENL Best practices,  co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  These PD opportunities will be offered as part of  our Monday PD opportunities, Lunch and   Learns, PD Days, etc. All Agendas, attendance sheets, and minutes will be collected and place in the ELL Binder.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In order to ensure that parents remain well-informed of the academic status of their children, the classroom teachers and the  ENL providers meet with individual parents during Parent Teacher conferences. Both the classroom teachers and the ENL  providers also use Tuesday afternoons for scheduling individual meetings with parents to discuss academic standing,  assessments results, goals, areas of focus, etc. Staff members communicate with parents through a variety of media such as  the telephone, written letters, and emails.     Additionally, the school is going to schedule two semi-annual individual meetings with all parents of ELL students to discuss the  overall/holistic academic performance of each child. During these meetings, parents will be informed of the child's progress in  all four modalities and his/her performance compared against the 4 ENL rubrics. Additionally, the ENL providers will share the  academic goals for each modality as well as recommendations for language development in the content areas.      All meetings between parents and staff members will be memorialized with an agenda, participant signature, and/or meeting  minutes. These documents will be placed in the ENL binder.      All meetings with parents will include translations services by either the ENL coordinator, parent volunteers, and/or the  Assistant principal for ELLs. If and when necessary, the school will utilize services provided by the office of translation services  in order to accommodate parents who speak languages other than Spanish.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The school deems parental involvement as vital to every child’s academic success. Therefore, PS 62 has set forth the goal of  increasing parental involvement and parental academic advancement as an intervention tool for our children. The school has  created numerous venues to engage the parents in order to give them a more active and participatory role in the academic  development of our children. For example, all communication to the parents from the school and Parents Association is in  both English and Spanish. Other language accommodations are made when needed. in such cases, staff members and/or  Translation Services is contacted to provided translations. In addition, parents/guardians of beginner and intermediate  students in grades K-5 have been provided with native language content area books whenever possible so parents can work  with their children at home.    Parents/guardians are directed to community resources by the Parent Coordinator to further assist families in bridging the gap  as their children acquire the English Language. Assisting the families of our English Language Learners has created an  environment that is supportive and nurturing for all concerned and this collaboration eases the way for our students.     The school continues to foster parent-school connections through activities such as:  - Parent Teacher conferences  - Super Tuesday activities for parents which include:  - Tuesday individual conferences between staff members and parents  - Tuesday grade-wide activities with parents  - Reading/Writing strategies  - Healthy Eating  - Spelling Bee  - Speech and Languages  - Arts and Craft  - Parent involvement: how to become more involve in your child's education  - Calming/Parenting Techniques  - What's Going on in Pre-K  - Physical Ed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Manfredonia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
