This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Vision    Section 4: CEP Overview      AOHT believes that by building student self-efficacy and instilling its core values of Academic Integrity, Optimally  Roundedness, High Expectations, and Tenacity, each student will grow socially, emotionally, academically, and thrive  as a lifelong learner and valuable member of society.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Mission    AOHT, in collaboration with Affinity and CUNY Support Networks, as well as post-secondary, community and industry  partners will ensure equity for each student by:   Inculcating self-efficacy and essential habits of methods of thought        Utilizing partnerships to maximize support, exposure and relevant experiences    Providing rigorous academic instruction in a socially inclusive and nurturing environment     Exposure to college level courses, and exams ensuring college readiness       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Academy of Hospitality and Tourism (AOHT) is a NYC public high school nestled in the culturally eclectic Flatbush  region of Brooklyn. AOHT is one of five schools on the Erasmus Hall Campus. In 2006, AOHT was founded in  collaboration with National Academic Foundation (NAF) and CCAP ( Careers in Culinary and Arts Program). The school  provides a rigorous Career and Technical Education (CTE) program with a focus on culinary arts, business, and the  hospitality industry.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 25% English language learners (ELLs) and 24% students with disabilities (SWDs). A majority  of our ELL students are beginners and need additional language acquisition support. SWDs range in areas of need and  additional support services. AOHT has SWDs that are learning disabled, limited mobility and one hearing impaired.  Teachers are well versed in student IEPs and their specific needs. We have two Special Education Teachers and one  ENL teacher, who provide push in support, specifically to scaffold instruction to meet the needs of our diverse  population of learners.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school year 2017-2018 saw many improvements resulting in an improvement in rigorous instruction, family  community ties and effective leadership as evidenced by the 2017-2018 parent and student survey. We did surface  the needs for improvement in school environment. School graduation rate increased from 53% in 2016-2017 to 88%  in 2017-2018.                              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K408   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   208   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

PM School classes  will begin on the second week of September and will run Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday's  from 2:30 - 4:00.  PM school courses will focus on credit accumulation, language acquisition and  Regents preparation.  Our certified ELL teacher and lead ELA teacher will work with our ELLs  in decoding text and will assist in application of learned content and skills into assignments.  The  goals of the credit recovery aspects are to provide additional support for struggling and off track  ELL students.  Completion of these courses will earn them credit, which in turn will move them  closer toward meeting their graduation requirement.  The computer skills aspect was created with  the rational that ELL students need to take multiple English courses, as a result they  are  programmed for our technology and business electives.  This will provide them an  opportunity to be better equipped with skills that will help them succeed in post-secondary skills  as well as in the business world.    -  We plan on expanding our iPad ENL support program.  As of now we have 22 iPads being  utilized by our ENL students.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Update June 2016:  Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) will be used as a formative reading assessment in which  teachers are able to systemically observe, record, and evaluate changes in student reading performance.  This data will be  used to gauge literacy levels and subsequently inform instruction.   Data illustrates a large number of beginner new comer (31)  ENL students.  Instruction will focus on building vocabulary and literacy.       We use teacher-created assessments to evaluate early literacy skills. Such assessments range greatly in format; some of these  assessments require students to write in their own language various literacy levels, while other assessments require students  to provide their knowledge of letter /sound recognition or how to use a bilingual dictionary. The data from these assessments  provides us with the conclusion that our ELL population has a great range of literacy levels. The data shows that we have a very  small percentage of ELLs who have low levels of literacy (including illiteracy), while the rest of our ELLs have an intermediate or  higher literacy level. The insights gathered from this data inform our school’s instructional plan in the following ways: all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         content area teachers embed literacy instruction through the implementation of our WIT program (Teaching Basic Writing  Skills), teachers strategically group students so that students with higher literacy levels can work with students with lower  literacy levels,  the ENL teacher uses many various strategies to teach a range of literacy skills, and the ESL teacher works with  other teachers to help them develop strategies for teaching earlier literacy skills.  Foutas and Pinnel.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teacher teams meet 2xs per week to ensure that teacher created assessment are in alignment with instructional  needs.  Teachers have access to Atlas Rubicon, which allows them to make edits on each others work online.   Achieve 3000 is used to support growth in reading level    Curriculum review periods at the end of each 6 week cycle of instruction     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our program is evaluated based on the number of students who improve their NYSESLAT and  NYSITELL performance. We also look at student scholarship data to determine credit accumulation and progress toward  graduation.  ELLs struggle most with Regents exams.  Social Studies and ELA exams provide the greatest the difficulty.  As a  result a certified ENL teacher will be programmed to push into all ELA and Social studies classes that contain ENL students.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students have been changed to a 3:2 flip model for physical education.  This allows for targeted instruction based on student  needs two periods per.  Based on the the review of summative data students be given intervention services at that time.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Update: 2017 scores have not been released yet.      Students tend to make the most substantial gains from 11  th   to 12  th   grade .  There are Patterns display a substantial drop  in score throughout grade levels with.  There were 17 intermediate, 7 beginners, 2 advanced based on 2015 NYSITELL data and  9 Intermediate, 8 beginners and 2 advanced based on the NYSELAT in 2014.   We recognized a number of students that moved  from intermediate to beginner.   As a result we created a lunch period ELL course for beginners .           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   All findings and data at AOHT is presented at SLT meetings.  We then open the floor for discussion and collaborate on next  steps.  Hold monthly grade level community meetings.  Parents are informed via email, backpacked letter and posted on the  school website.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         We will continue to use this model    Update June 2016:  As of September 2016 AOHT is adopting an integrated block model with push in ENL support from  1.5 ENL teachers.  Instruction is differentiated based on language level proficiency by the push in ENL  teacher.   Beginners are provided with a stand alone ENL class.          Organizational Models:  The organizational model of ENL Instruction at  the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism  (AOHT) is homogeneous  b. Program Models:  The program model is Homogeneous -- all students regardless of grade are placed in classes  according to their proficiency levels on the LAB-R and NYSESLAT (i.e. beginners, intermediates, and advanced  response Stand-alone ENL instruction seeks to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core  content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher to students who require the service.  Stand-alone ENL  classes are self-contained. Integrated ENL instruction seeks to build English language skills through content area  instruction. This is accomplished through common planning sessions and professional development led by the ESL  teacher and our Affinity Support Specialist.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Update June 2016:  Students are programmed in STARS with a push in ELL teacher coded into the appropriate classes.  Student  schedules are reviewed to verify they are receiving the required number of instructional minutes as per CR Part 154.       Explicit ENL and ELA instruction minutes are delivered on our Self-Contained ENL Program as per CR Part 154.  All beginners  have three 45 minute periods of ENL each day five times per week, thus exceeding the requirement of 600 minutes per week  of ENL for beginning ELLs.  All intermediate students have two 40 minute periods of ENL each day five times per week, thus  exceeding the requirement of 400 minutes per week of ESL instruction for intermediate ELLs.  All advanced students have one  40 minute period of ENL instruction five times per week, as well as one 40 minute period of ELA instruction five times per  week, thus exceeding the requirement of 200 minutes per week of ELA instruction.  Since the only program model at AOHT is  Self-Contained ESL, NLA instruction is not offered       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   AOHT now utilizes an integrated block model. ENL instruction is aligned with Common Core Learning as each lesson’s aim  follows Common Core ELA standards with an emphasis on Conventions of English Standards. ENL instructional approaches  include sensory, graphic, and interactive supports. ENL instruction embeds native language and the use of imagery as a daily  tool to make content comprehensible to foster English language development. The ENL classroom provides students with  bilingual dictionaries in every ELL students’ native language, picture dictionaries , bilingual phrasebooks, and the use of online  dictionaries and translators; the use of these resources are a part of daily instructional practices. All of the above mentioned  methods scaffold learning for ENLs and are thus in alignment with the CCLS standards.The ENL teacher uses a range of  instructional methods to ensure that students are  building comprehension across all content areas along with linguistic  knowledge,  development, and performance in English.  All units are thematic-based and designed around an essential  question. The essential question is then explored and developed through all genres of literature, including fiction, science  texts, informational readings, poetry, historical non fiction, and drama.  In addition.  "Keys to Learning" and "Keystone" series  are utilized to teach students English across all content areas.  Technology is utilized to increase student interest in  achievement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64       Multiple texts are used as well as other media. Classes focus on the four essential modalities of reading, writing, listening and  speaking and the curriculum is aligned with both ELA and ESL New York State Learning Standards and New York City ELA  Performance Standards. Learning strategies are taught explicitly and careful attention is paid to develop students’ critical  thinking skills. Classes use structured immersion and instruction draws upon various strategies to scaffold, support and raise  students’ academic achievement. Techniques include the differentiated instruction, balanced literacy scaffold for ELLs and  project-based authentic language learning activities. Students receive language-to-language dictionaries and content-area  glossaries for use in classes and during high-stakes testing. The school complies with all time and location mandates for  testing.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Although the ELLs are not taught in their native language in our school, they have plenty of exposure to their native  languages through texts, tests, iPads, and tasks translated in their native languages.  They will receive training in using  electronic translation websites.  They have access to translation glossaries by content and to people who speak their native  language.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instructional plan for SIFE:             SIFE students receive one on one instruction during ESL instructional time. Differentiation for SIFE students sometime  requires separate assignments, a modified tasks, or being partnered with a native language speaking classmate. Differentiation  for a newcomer includes the same aforementioned techniques/approaches as for SIFEs, however a newcomer receives more  explicit language instruction with a heavy emphasis on grammar and vocabulary acquisition. Differentiation for a developing  ELL shifts instruction to English only or English most of the time; this subgroup will make use of both bilingual and English only  definitions for vocabulary acquisition. The Long Term ELL receives help in translating common language into academic  language with a push of academic language instruction. Finally, the former ELL is provided with extra support in English class  which consists of one on one for writing. Mandated services for former ELLs are for testing accommodations which include a  separate location, time and a half, and state-approved glossaries.    Educational interventions are written and implemented for all SIFE at the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism.  The  interventions are based on student data acquired through both formal and informal assessments in ENL and the content areas,  as communicated by the student's teachers in each subject area.  The student's strengths are drawn upon to plan motivating  curriculum and to design differentiated means of assessment that will both challenge the student and also allow them to  experience academic success.     b. Instructional plan for newcomers (less than three years in US schools):                 Newcomers participate in our Balanced Literacy Program at the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism.  Many  newcomers test as beginners, so they receive three 45 minute periods of ENL every day five times week.  The intermediates  receive two 45 minute periods five times a week and the advanced newcomers receive one 45 minute period of ENL and one  45 minute period of ENA five times a week. In ENL class, the teacher models reading comprehension strategies vocabulary  building strategies, phonics, and writing practices in mini-lessons, which are followed up by group, paired and individual  student practice.  Whenever possible, art and music are integrated into the lessons in order to reach all student levels of  comprehension and knowledge to allow for differentiated assessment.  In addition, a leveled classroom library of all genres is  accessible for student use, including native language texts in Spanish, French and Haitian Creole.                   c.   Instructional plan for ELLs receiving 4 - 6 years of ESL service:                   Students receiving 4 - 6 years of ESL service are identified by the ESL teacher, content area teachers and guidance  counselors using the available student data reports. The teachers and counselors meet monthly to discuss the student's  current academic track record and potential graduation date.  Each student is assigned (By grade level) to a teacher mentor  who is committed to monitoring the student's academic progress and development.  In addition, most of these ELLs attend  after school classes in order to meet the academic graduation requirements.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                       d.   Instructional plan for Long-Term ELLs:  In order to help Long-Term ELLs meet graduation requirements and achieve academic success, an online Academy is being  developed for the content area courses, such as History, English and Science. All long-term ELLs are encouraged to attend the  program offerings by their ESL and content area teachers.  Furthermore, like the 4 - 6 year ELLs, these students are tracked and  discussed on a monthly basis by the ESL teacher, content area teachers and guidance counselors.                  e. The ESL teacher monitors progress of former ELLs and ensures that ELLs receive testing accommodations as needed  on Regents examinations.  These often include time extension, separate location, third reading of listening selection on ELA  Regents, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries and simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions.     Testing accommodations - ALl ELL students receive time and a half or double time on exams.  The only exception is SWDs.  In  these cases students the IEP contains the testing accommodation, which AOHT adheres to.  If there is no testing  accommodation the default is time and a half.  The parent is notified of this and is given the opportunity to request a re- eval.         I       Plan for ELLs identified as having special needs:           Eligible English Language learners who are identified as having special needs receive a paraprofessional who provides  daily academic assistance.  Various scaffolding techniques are regularly implemented to help these students achieve academic  excellence.  Lessons are created by the ENL teacher and content area teachers that target both the student's strengths to build  upon and their weaknesses.  ELLs having special needs are included in all aspects of our school, including our ENL classes.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The following is a list of grade-level materials used for instruction for ELL-SWDs that provide both academic content areas and  accelerate English language development: Pearson’s Sidie by Side Plus Life Skills by Steven J. Molinsky & Bill Bliss, Longman  Keys to Learning Text & Workbook, Longman Keystone Text & Workbook, and Longman’s Third Edition of Stories We Brought  With Us by Carol Kasser & Ann Silverman. Instructional strategies range from vocabulary modification, linking new information  to prior knowledge, to using visual aids. Once again, native language materials are embedded into instruction specifically for  vocabulary acquisition. Our school ensures that ELL-SWDs receive appropriate instruction and services based upon each  individual student’s IEP and ESL level. In some cases, students receive self- contained IEP instruction, or speech services  throughout the day, along with self-contained ESL class. The ESL teacher uses direct instruction as well as cross-curricular  content-area projects. Students work in small groups to allow stronger students to assist weaker ones in indirect teaching and  self-learning. A content-area based textbook and workbook series is utilized in the classroom as well. Currently, several special  needs students are hearing impaired and receive services through a separate hearing department program, as specified in  their IEPs. IEP requirements for these students take priority over ESL per state regulations. Additionally, these students' LAB-R  and NYSESLAT scores are being re-evaluated by the DOE due to clarification of state regulations that indicate they may have  been tested in error and should not be classified as ELLs. These students may be re evaluated using the new English Language  Acquisition Needs Determination (ELAND) Review Procedures. For those students who are ELL-SWDs, the Assistant Principal of  Student Support Services ensures that in addition to ESL services, students are provided with the recommended services that  are listed on the IEPs of ELL students.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Through differentiation, adaptive planning when necessary, revisiting of goals throughout the year.   We also identify the ELL- SWDs and create ICT classes based on their programs first.  We then use STARs to determine if this is the most efficient  allocation of special education resources.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Academy of Hospitality and Tou                                                                              School DBN: 17k408  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
