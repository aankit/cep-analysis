This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The High School of Applied Communication is committed to developing a productive learning environment that  fosters a meaningful and respectful collaboration among students, staff, parents/guardians, and the community in  order to produce college and career ready students. With a strong focus on promoting literacy and communication  skills across the curriculum, our instruction is delivered through a standards-based, individualized and authentic  learning program. Routines, active engagement, and opportunities to apply new knowledge characterize all classes  which supports a culture of responsibility, citizenship, and self-directed, lifelong learning.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The High School of Applied Communication is a high school with 424 students from grade 9 through grade 12.The  school population comprises 9% Black, 60% Hispanic, 15 % White, 12% Asian students and 4% other students. The  student body includes 7% English language learners and 17% special education students. Boys account for 43.87% of  the students enrolled and girls account for 56.13%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2015-2016 was  89%.      Some Instructional Highlights of our school:   Incoming students are scheduled for classes that prepare them for certification in the area of Microsoft Office and  Office 365. By accessing and mastering these 21st century electronic tools, we hope to better prepare students for  modern day collaboration and communication and make them more prepared for college and career.   All teachers participate in professional development, common planning and inquiry teams on a monthly basis.   Students have the opportunity to take College Now classes and Advanced Placement courses at LaGuardia Community  College. Currently our school is a member of the AP for ALL program, which has made access to multiple AP courses  possible for all students. Currently we offer the following AP courses: US History, Spanish, Psychology, English  Literature, English Language and Composition .   We have a variety of special events and programs to bring all members of our school community together, including  students, parents, and staff. These include our annual Thanksgiving Family Dinner, our Multi-Cultural Festival, and  Awards Receptions in the fall and spring.       The school maintains a friendly and supportive atmosphere. Students feel they belong here and are encouraged to  propose and run after school events such as school dances, clubs and special events. One such event was the Smash  Brothers computer game tournament, whose attendance included a substantial amount of the student body.       Student recognition is an integral part of school culture. On a monthly basis, the school celebrates students who have  achieved academic mastery and made significant improvement in their work ( i.e. Student of the Month Breakfast).  Additionally, the students who achieve academic excellence are also inducted into the National Honors society. This  elite group of students lead various community services projects around the school ( i.e. peer tutoring, food  drives,etc)            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10               3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Ou school currently has 16.33 % special education students which are supported largely through Integrated Co- teaching. Within the ICT model of instruction, we have two teachers in the room to support the unique needs of our  students. Within these classes, our teachers use the six models of co-teaching to support our students. Through  providing students multiple entry points into the curriculum, our students can achieve and be successful.   Our school also has a small number of self-contained classrooms designed to help students further contextualize the  curriculum .               4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction    Key Areas of Focus for the 2018-19 school year      To increase student engagement through the development of cognitively challenging instruction and high-level  discussion using text-based protocols.         Rigorous Instruction      We will continue to develop a rigorous instructional program aligned to the state standards and curriculum. Our  teachers will collaborate to develop common core aligned lessons and units of study which provide students  increased opportunities to participate in high level learning activities and discussion which require strategic and  extended critical thinking (as defined by Webb’s Depth of Knowledge.) This action will result in a five percent increase  in the number of teachers receiving effective and highly effective ratings in area of 1.E (“Designing Coherent  Instruction”) and 3C. (“Engaging Students in Learning”) on the Danielson Framework for Teaching.   Supportive Environment   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Our school will develop a safe and supportive learning environment, with a focus on a positive school climate, social  and emotional learning and academic support. By promoting student voice, collaborating with parents and developing  a more supportive school community, our attendance rate will increase 2% by the end of the school year.      Collaborative Teachers   Teachers will have increased opportunities to work together in a collaborative environment to support student  success and improve the quality of teaching. By working together in teams and model classrooms, we will have a 5%  increase in the number of students who receive a 75 or better on the Algebra I regents. Moreover, we will also have a  5% increase in the number in the number of students who receive a 75 and higher on the ELA regents. By achieving  this goal, more students will graduate college and career ready.         Effective Leadership   Promote a positive school culture through stronger relationships between students and teachers built on trust.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The school has developed a series of Advanced placement classes which has provided students access to college ready  courses which includes US History, Psychology, Spanish, English Literature and English Language and Composition.  Moreover, the school has increased student participation in The LaGuardia College Now Program four times since the  year prior. Additionally, within our science and math program, our students have had the opportunity to access high  level "college ready" classes in the area Algebra 2 and Chemistry in record numbers.   Moving forward, regents scores and advanced placement scores indicate that students are still struggling to pass  these high level classes. While students are accessing high level classes, data shows that 55 percent of the students  passed Algebra 1 and 60 percent passed Algebra II with a college ready score of 75 or better.   In order to improve in these areas, our school has recently hired a new science and math AP to support teacher  growth and student achievement. Teacher teams have also been working together on the development of lessons and  unit of study which are rigorous, engaging for students and aligned to the common core state standards in order to  increase increase the academic performance of our students. While student regents performance has increased in  United States History and Global History and Geography, student performance in science and math has declined, as  the school has democratized access to advanced courses. A good example of this is providing students all tenth grade  students access to the Common Core ELA exam, where in prior years this was an exam reserved only for 11th graders.  Another example of this was in the area of Algebra II, where the school provided students additional access to this  exam by 312% in one year. While students have increased access to college ready classes, student performance  remains as challenge, as the pass rate declined to 29% from the year prior. As we increase access and equity to  college ready classes, our school needs to increase academic performance. Therefore, we are prioritizing a five  percent increase in teacher growth in the following areas to better support student learning ( i.e.  "1A--Designing  Coherent Instruction" and "3C. Engaging Students in Learning”as defined by the Danielson rubric.    Hence, by improving the development of engaging, coherent instruction based upon the incorporation of text based  protocols in every classroom, students will have increased support in their learning.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Our  teachers will collaborate to develop common core aligned lessons and units of study which provide students increased  opportunities to participate in high level learning activities and discussion which require strategic and extended critical  thinking (as defined by Webb’s Depth of Knowledge.) This action will result in a five percent increase in the number of  teachers receiving effective and highly effective ratings in area of 1.E (“Designing Coherent Instruction”) and 3C.  (“Engaging Students in Learning”) on the Danielson Framework for Teaching. By February 2019, there will be a two  percent increase in teacher performance in both of the areas stated above.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

The school will conduct systematic training of parents over the course of the semester in reference to explaining the  requirements of what it means to be "college ready". The school will also make parents aware of how to take  advantage of new educational opportunities at the school. The school will seek to promote student participation in  College Now and advanced placement courses as a pathway towards college success.      The guidance department will lead a series of "college ready" workshops for parents at PTA meetings and seek to  systematically engage families into what it means to be college ready and support the development of "rigorous  instruction for students." School leadership will also participate in a series of workshops which seek to promote  rigorous instruction amongst parents.

Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  In the past, the school had a multi-session schedule which did not allow for extensive teacher collaboration and  sharing of best practices. Starting in the 2017-18 school year, our school has shifted to a single session school  schedule which has been optimized to allow for professional development sessions to take place after school for a  one hour and twenty minute period time period. Moreover, our school has also developed a Tuesday after-school  time block which will allows for parental outreach in the form of case conferencing and additional time for inquiry  teams to meet and analyze student work.   Through this important schedule adjustment, we hope to unify the instructional staff around the same training  opportunities, which was not possible in the past "multi- session school".

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Strength   In June 2018, the annual attendance report indicated an 89% attendance rate.       Graduation rate was 82%    According to learning survey data, most students indicate that they are attending school in a safe   environment, free from bullying, gangs and other threats to their physical well being.   Priorities:   Improvement of classroom instruction    At the end of June 2018, teacher evaluation data indicated that 33% of the teacher staff was rated "developing" in the  area of planning for "coherent instruction". Moreover, 3.24% were rated "ineffective" in the area of student  engagement. Additionally, 42% of the teachers were rated developing and 4% were ineffective. As some regents  scores reflect a 60% failure rate ( i.e. Algebra one and Earth Science), our instructional team will focus on curriculum  alignment, mapping and the development of common assessments to keep instruction on track for the 2018-2019  school year.      Hence, we will continue to develop a rigorous instructional program aligned to the state standards and curriculum.  Our teachers will collaborate to develop common core aligned lessons and units of study which provide students  increased opportunities to participate in high level learning activities and discussion which require strategic and  extended critical thinking (as defined by Webb’s Depth of Knowledge.)

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. High School for Applied Communication, in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   High School for Applied Communication will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY  Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components:  1.   The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.

The population consists of 18 freshmen, 6 sophomores, 5 juniors and 2 seniors. The  majority of our ELL students have been in the country from one to five years. The language of  instruction is English and language proficiency levels range from transitioning to expanding.  Spanish is the predominant home language for our ELLs; however, our ENL population also  speaks Arabic, Turkish, Telugu, Bangla, Thai, Hindi, Filipino and Urdu.  The ENL instructional design implemented at HSAC includes a “push-in” model where the  certified ENL teacher co-plans with different content instructors to give students equal access of  the learning activity thereby ensuring their understanding of the academic goals, which is to be  assessed at the end of class through an informal assessment. Also, there is a dually licensed ELA  and ENL teacher who teaches stand-alone ELA classes with Special Education support since  some of our ENL students also have IEPs. Instructional strategies utilized in the classrooms  include scaffolding the text and content through different reading comprehension strategies,  question and discussion support, inferencing, summarizing, synthesizing and determining  relevance or importance. There is a focus on language acquisition and test-taking strategies  through vocabulary, sentence and essay level support and guidance, along with grammar, when  necessary taught through content and context. The four modalities are consistently stressed and  integrated into lessons to ensure that students have ample practice to speak, read, write and listen  through different activities. Writing along with reading comprehension is emphasized in all  classes, as many students are weaker in this modality based on NYSESLAT and Regents data.  The following programs will be funded through Title III and will serve to supplement the regular  class program for all ENL students, as well as to enhance parental involvement. The aim of these  programs is to reinforce the content and language support our ENL and former ENL students  need in order to develop and become adept at utilizing the skills needed to gain success in the  NYSESLAT, Regents and become College Ready students. Resources for these programs will  include Regents review books, NYSESLAT preparation books, exam samples and online  resources.

Teachers' work will be collected and scanned into Google Drive for future reference  and as models for other teachers. These sessions will be led by our licensed ENL teacher, Jie  Dong, and will take place once a month for 4 months during our regularly scheduled weekly  professional development time on Monday afternoons. Some of the topics include:  ·  ·  ·  ·  Based on our inquiry groups' data analysis in ELA, History and Science, ENL students show  difficulty in answering multiple choice questions because of the difficulty in tier 2 and 3. By  providing these topics during professional development it will increase awareness of the needs of  ENL students. Teachers will be asked to use the scaffolds to assist learning for all the  students.  Teachers will be asked to bring in student work to showcase and share with the staff.  They will make informal assessments of how these strategies are benefiting their students, for  example: if students are internalizing the vocabulary learned through different vocabulary  strategies then it will be evident in their speaking and writing.  Teachers working in the Title III program will receive professional development through  planning with the ENL teacher.

The Cultural Celebrations Under the  supervision of the ENL Coordinator, Ms. Dong, the ENL students will have the opportunity to  plan a school wide Thanksgiving Dinner in November and Multi-Cultural Fair in the spring.  Participating in these events will foster students’ leadership, organizational skills and literacy  skills while practicing language in all four modalities. The fair intends to build student  confidence in their languages (native and English), culture and school pride by giving them the  opportunity to take ownership and have a vision for this fair that will teach others about  themselves and their origins. Furthermore, this will help parents of ENL students to play a larger  role by participating in the fair along with the students in writing poetry, poetry slams, teaching  others about their culture. The fairs are also a time for the parents to say anything they want to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    say to their child, they will have to opportunity to present a piece of writing in our open-mics. If  the piece is in a different language, there will be subtitles projected onto a screen and translated  pieces will also be provided in the itinerary. This will be a great way for parents to showcase to  their child a talent they have or a touching piece of writing that they have been wanting to share.  All parental presentations will be reviewed prior to presentation by the ENL teacher and  principal.  Parents will be notified of these events through our newsletters and multilingual flyers which  will be mailed home. These newsletters and any informative letters will be translated into all the  different languages spoken by the parents by students and proof-read by school staff.  Additionally, our parent coordinator will make phone calls to increase interest and answer  questions. At the events, the parents will receive a translated itinerary of the schedules and  translations of the presentations. Students and school staff will also be available to assist with  translation.   Through conversations with the guidance counselor, an issue of parent disengagement and  detachment with the student on an emotional level, academic expectations and understanding of  the student's personality and goals was revealed. Our goal is to help bridge a better relationship  and more open communication between students and their parents through the open- mic sessions. We will hold an event every two months to commemorate student writing, art and  other projects completed in their content classes; parents will be invited to celebrate with the  students to reinforce the essence of appreciation for the students' hard work.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  N/A       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   N/A     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Success of our ESL programs is evaluated in a variety of ways.  The ESL teacher, along with content area teachers, examine  student work to determine levels of progress.  Pre-assessments are administered to students at the start of various units of  study and this data is compared to data derived from culminating projects or other assessments at the end of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         unit.  Regents scores and class grades for students, as well as  NYSESLAT data is analyzed by the ESL teacher and content area/  special education teachers to identify yearly progress and/ or gaps in achievement.             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have established "Our House" an after school tutorial program in various content area subjects.  We also have peer  tutoring during school and lunch hours daily.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the data, all students fall into the transitional and expanding or commanding proficiency levels, with the  exception of one student who is a beginner.  18 students (not including current 9th graders) moved from either intermediate  to advanced or advanced to proficient.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The Inquiry Team including ENL teachers review the NYSESLAT data  from year to year to compare and contrast students'  language acquisition progress in the four modalities. The Inquiry team and ENL teacher complies a list of ENL students with  info of their language progress, length of time in an ENL program and HL for all content area teachers and plan a program to  meet the student's needs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    HSAC has a push in Co -Teaching Model, as well as a pull-out program.        b. Our school utilizes a combination of models.  In the 9th, 10th, and 11th grade, there is a block program.  The ESL  teacher pushes in to various content classes five times per week.  Students who require additional time are serviced in  a pull out program.  All 12th grade ESL students are served in either a pull-out/push in program.  Students in pull-out  programs are heterogeneously grouped.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     This program is not applicable.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      this program is not applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               The ENL Coordinator and the AP in charge of programing,  review the results of the NYSESLAT  and program students  according to their proficiency levels for 2016-17 school year.   a.  Entering students receive 540 minutes per week.  Emerging students receive 360 minutes per   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      week.   Transitiong/expanding students receive 180 minutes per week and Commanding students receive 90 minutes per week  of ENL services by a certified ENL teacher.  There is emphasis on listening skills via note-taking and auditory practice.  Non- fiction passages and written responses are also emphasized.  Curriculum is specifically designed to strengthen literacy skills  through independent reading, read alouds, student and teacher conferencing, personal reflection and daily writing.  The  majority of students across all grades require intensive assistance in the reading and writing modalities.  Therefore our  program places a stronger emphasis on those modalities through ESL scaffolding strategies(bridging, modeling,  contextualization, schema building, meta-cognitive development and text-representation).  In addition our school goals reflect  an emphasis on literacy across the curriculum, with a specific focus on non-fiction reading and argument writing in alignment  with Common Core Standards.     To support weaknesses identified through the NYSESLAT and performance assessments,  a writing initiative has been  developed starting in the 9th grade focused on writing complexity, grammar, and organizational skills.  The ESL teacher meets  weekly with 9th grade English, Social Studies, and Science teachers to identify weekly goals and develop/ share resources.     Students are given the option of taking exams in their native language, however, the majority prefer to write responses in  English with several using the native language form of the exam as reference.  The use of native language in the classroom is  supported by content area teachers. During the work period, immediately following the mini-lesson for the day,  students are  permitted to use their native language for small group discussions or projects. ELL students are also encouraged to use native  language dictionaries in class and to select independent reading material in their native language.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In our school we do not have a TBE or a Dual Language Program.  Content area instruction for ELLs is only delivered through a  Freestanding ESL program.  ESL services are delivered by a licensed ESL teacher through a push in/pull out model.  Instruction  is delivered in English in all content area classes through the workshop model, which includes an mini-lesson, independent and  shared practice and a summary closing.  The ESL teacher pushes into ELA and social studies classes five times a week and team  teaches with the English teacher.  Emerging students receive an additional discrete ESL class where content area subjects are  revisited and specific language skills are taught.  All classrooms are equipped with bilingual dictionaries in students’ specific  native languages, and bilingual literature is available in English classroom libraries.  The ESL teachers also uses language  workbooks at levels based on the students' needs.  Students are encouraged to select literature in their native language for  independent reading. Students are also encouraged to converse in their native language with one another to offer additional  support in making the content comprehensible.  The ENL and content teachers focus on academic vocabulary specific to the  content and have complied a list of words in order to make the content more comprehensible to ENL studnets.     The ESL teacher and content teacher plan weekly to collaborate and discuss the individual needs of the ESL students in their  class and strategies to meet the Common Core Standards.  Lessons are designed with a focus on vocabulary, argument reading  and writing, non-fiction, and speaking and listening skills. The ESL teacher also provides content area support by:  •     Small group instruction  •     Scaffolding  •     Use of realia  •     Visuals  •     Modeling  •     Mapping   •     Graphic organizers  •     Reading material in various genres     There is also a focus on test-taking strategies in order to prepare students for the Regents exams.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Our school offers a free standing ESL program only, therefore our ELLs do not take classes in their native  language.    However, many ENL students take a foreign language - ie - Spanish.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A- SIFE  In order to meet the needs of our SIFE students we have implemented the following programs and strategies:  •     Extended day opportunities, including after school tutoring and programs  •     Team teaching  •     Recruiting native language tutors  •     Content aligned curriculum   •     Establishing a buddy system (peers as “buddies)  •     ESL teacher mentors SIFE student  •     Flexibility in curriculum-creating a curriculum for SIFE students based on state standards focusing on essential knowledge  and skills  B - 0-3 years  Newcomers receive a language "buddy" to assist them in adjusting to the school and to assist them with subject matter.  Their  schedules are often aligned with the ESL teacher's so that they can attend "Lunch and Learn" sessions.  They are also invitied  to after school tutorials and are involved in Peer Tutoring during the day.  C- 4-6 years  Students who have been in ESL for 4 – 6 years are evaluated by the ESL teacher by reviewing the NYSESLAT results for that  year in all the modalities-Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing.  The ESL teacher compares the results from the previous  year to determine where there has been growth and the modalities that need to targeted to ensure that students are moving  positively towards proficiency in English.    The ESL and ELA teachers have common planning time 1x per week (48 min) to plan  and discuss students’ specific educational needs for the upcoming week. The ESL teacher pushes into the ELA class 5x a week  (48min period) to meet mandated services and intermediate students have an additional discrete ESL class.    •     Emphasis is on non fiction reading  •     Use of 5W questions to assess comprehension of academic text  •     Book Club – reading for pleasure and social discussion  •     Common lunch periods with the ESL teacher for extra support  •     Use of Computer Lab for school projects  •     Q-TEL Scaffolds & Specific tasks: modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text representation and  metacognition development  •     Students read and write for information and current events using articles and newspapers  •     Use of sentence manipulatives, graphic organizers, note taking skills, and peer editing  D - Long term ELLs  Long-term ELL students attend extended day programs and have conferences with content area teachers.  Their work is  analyzed to identify strengths and weaknesses so that instruction can be modified to their needs.  Conferences with special  education teachers take place at  formal meetings and also during "on the fly" conversations to make sure that IEP  recommendations are being followed.  We also are compiling subject specific glossaries to make difficult academic language  comprehensible to all.  For those ELLs who need more than 4 years to graduate there are special sessions with the Guidance  Counselor and Social Worker in an effort to provide appropriate extended day classes or alternative programs for credit  recovery.  There are extensive support services in place for academic intervention: extended day tutorials with content area  teachers and the ESL teacher, and computer lab sessions to support student research and writing.     E. Commanding students are programmed for ENL services for 90 minutes  per week and some students are programed into  the same ELA class as the ELL students so that they have the support of the ESL teacher when necessary.   The ESL teacher has   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      an "Open Door Policy" which allows students to seek help whenever necessary.  These students also continue to receive  testing accommdations for two years after achieving a proficient score on the NYSESLAT.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ELL and SWD students have access to the same content area curriculum as general education students.  Teachers support  these students through giving directions both orally and in writing, providing scaffolds such as graphic organizers, outlines, and  sentence starters, incorporating visuals such as charts, graphics, photographs, and film clips, and by providing different levels  of text on the same topic.  Language development is further supported through the promotion of small group and class  discussion and student presentations.  Students are grouped strategically to promote active engagement.  The ESL teacher and  special education teacher meet on a monthly basis to plan and discuss the needs of the SWD/ESL students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The delivery of instruction through the workshop model gives teachers the opportunity to allow students to work  collaboratively during the work period and for teachers to conference with students and provide small group or individualized  instructional support as necessary.  The ESL teacher, programmer, and special education teacher when appropriate work  together to individualize a program that will meet each student's individual needs so that they are able to learn in the least  restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted  intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, and other content areas are as follows: extended day tutorials with  content area teachers and the ESL teacher, computer lab sessions to support student research and writing, Saturday Regents  review programs with content and ESL teachers.  The ESL teacher meets weekly wth the 9th grade Inquiry Team to analyze  student work and plan for interventions.  Title lll funds will be allocated to supplement our existing ELL program.  Our Title lll  program will have a cultural, academic and parental focus.  It will include a Film-Making Residency for 9th grade ELLs, Book  Club, cultural excursions, parental education, Multicultural Fair, extra access to computer lab, as well as Saturday Regents  Prep.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year we are instituting an expository writing program starting with all 9th grade students, including ELLs.  The goal of the  program is to provide students with a more structured and scaffolded approach to writing.  9th grade English and Social  Studies teachers will use common techniques for writing complex sentences,  writing outlines, etc.  Our ESL teacher, along with  two social studies teachers and administrators, was trained in the program through the Winward Teacher Training Institute  and will further support ELL students in this program.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   never had one     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The push-in model ensures that all ESL students are afforded the same standards-based curriculum with the additional support  of ESL strategies.  ELL students are currently enrolled in AP courses and College Now programs.  They are encouraged to  participate in all extra-curricular activities, including PSAL sports, student government, book club, senior activities, peer  tutoring, etc.  Students also attend cultural trips, Regents prep classes, and have access to all school resources, including the  computer lab.:         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Materials used to support ELLs are books on tape, charts, classroom libraries, as well as multi-lingual books for independent  reading and computer software.  All 9th and 10th grade ELLs have a technology class and others take more advanced classes  during their junior and senior year.  All classrooms have bilingual dictionaries in the students' native languages.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Freestanding ESL is currently our only program model.  Native language support is delivered through the interaction between  students who are proficient in both languages and act as peer tutors.  Also our parent coordinator and other bilingual staff  members often assist students and parents when necessary.  Translators are brought in in various languages for parent  teacher conferences  when necessary through the use of the Translation Unit.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services and resources are appropriate to the students' age and levels of language proficiency.    The ENL teacher reviews  student data on ATS.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Materials used to support ELLs are books on tape, charts, classroom libraries, as well as multi-lingual books for independent  reading and computer software.  All 9th and 10th grade ELLs have a technology class and others take more advanced classes  during their junior and senior year.  All classrooms have bilingual dictionaries in the students' native languages.  We share the  building with two other H.S. and share the school cafeteria.  PSAL sports is an area that all three schools participate in.. All  three schools have students participating in various sports such as, basketball,, track, soccer,  rugby and softball.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All new students are invited to attend freshman orientation before the school year begins.  Parents are also invited to meet  with staff and tour the school.:   All newly enrolled students and their guardians meet with the ESL teacher and parent  coordinator and are given a tour of the school and the student's program.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is the only language elective offered at the school.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Because of our school's small size, all teachers work with ELL students in at least one class.  Therefore, all teachers are involved  in professional development related to the ELL population. Teachers and staff are initially surveyed to determine their needs in  terms of ESL professional development.  Various professional development workshops are offered outside of the school  through the DOE, support network, and BETAC and the assistant principal supervising ESL works to match ESL, content area   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      and special education teachers, guidance counselor, and parent coordinator with workshop that will meet their needs as they  become available.       Within the school, professional development is provided primarilly through our licensed ESL teacher,  as well as assistant  principal. The entire staff meets each Tuesday and Thursday for 45 for either professional development sessions or Inquiry  Work.

The Guidance Department, which includes the guidance counselor, school social worker, and assistant principal, assists all  staff members in learning strategies to target some of the transition issues faced by all new students, including ELL  students.  Some of these issues include organization, time management, study skills, and mental health.  They also assist  teachers in communicating effectively with parents and students as they progress through this transitional period.  The parent  coordinator assists with this type of communication if the parent or guardian does not speak English.  The guidance  department also shares protocols for referring students for support services on an as needed basis.      3.   Most teachers have completed the minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training, as per a survey distributed to all teachers.  The  assistant principal of ESL, maintains the records and updates them periodically as teachers complete their required  hours.  Professional development topics include: Identifying ELL Students, Scaffolding instruction for ESL Students, Analyzing  Data, Understanding the Components of the NYSESLAT, etc.   Teachers who are deficient in hours will also be encouraged by  the assistant principl to attend professional development outside of the school through the DOE, network support team, or  other organizations as they become available.        Our ESL teacher regularly attends workshops and PD events  held by the DOE Office of English Language Learners. As well the  LPT team have access to professional learning opportunites in multiple content areas and  that focus onn CCLS.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance counselor meet with ELLs to provide counseling and assistance. They hold meetings with the ESL teacher to  review students' progress, and they provide advice for our staff as how to deal with a student if he/she is having a difficult time  coping with the changes.  Teachers meet in grade teams and departments where they will share concerns they have about  how students are transitioning and they will help each other to develop plans to assist them.     Our teachers will share best practices for co-teaching and integrating language and content instruction according to the ELL  Policy and Reference Guide for all students and English Language Learners. These PD sessions occur weekly in our school as  well as the time spent in inquiry and professional planning time.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents, including parents of ELLs, are informed of school events through our monthly newsletter, flyers, and phone  messages, all of which are translated.  Our school website is also a valuable resource.  Parents are encouraged to attend  events, such as the Thanksgiving Family Dinner, Multi-Cultural Fair, film screenings, drama performances, talent shows, awards  nights, and sports events.  ALL parents are specifically targeted for participation in our beginner computer classes, taught by  our technology teacher, Mr. Riese.  Monthly workshops on a variety of topics, including graduation requirements, college,  financial aid, teen issues, etc., are offered for all parents and interpretation is offered as necessary.  Our parent coordinator  plays a large role in keeping the lines of communication open with ELL parents.           2. Our parent coordinator refers parents to Community Based  Organizations for assistance, including:             a. Queens Adult Learning Center             b. Queens Community House             c. LaGuardia Community College - Saturday Academy & Teen Academy which parents attend with their children     3.  Parents are surveyed each year to give feedback on their experience and needs.  Parents are encouraged to visit the school  to meet with members of the administration and parent coordinator.  Parents who attend parent events, including PTA  meetings and Parent-Teacher conferences, are asked to indicate their language translation needs.     4.  Offering parents the opportunity to feel a part of the school community is a priority at HSAC.  Our events keep parents  informed on topics that are timely and significant to their needs and to the needs of their children.  They also give parents a  chance to get to know our staff so that they are more comfortable asking questions, sharing concerns, and requesting support.              2.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                  School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
