This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS/IS 119’s mission is to provide the whole child with strategies, skills, and character traits to become a constructive  member of society and the work force. In order to do so, students are provided with rigorous academics and  opportunities to fulfill their social and emotional potential for growth in collaboration with faculty who will support  each child. We strive to provide students within an inclusive setting, which is the optimal learning environment, to  become the best that they can be.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 119 The Glendale is an elementary/middle school with 1270 students from grade K-8. The school population  comprises 2% Black, 31% Hispanic, 40% White, and 25% Asian students. The student body includes 4% English  language learners and 9% special education students. Boys account for 49% of the students enrolled and girls account  for 51%. The year-to-date average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 is 96%.   Our school is comprised of over 50% of the Gifted and Talented population in grades K-8. Their needs include a  various high-level curricula (Regents Algebra, Regents Living Science, Regents Earth Science, Mandarin, robotics,  performing arts) that will be challenging. Likewise, our zoned students receive many of the same coursework  including STEM, coding, performing arts and language. We revised our program to include equity among the students  with the intent of creating programs that require students to strive for excellence.    We have finished the continuum for the growth of our elementary/middle school grades. One of the most significant  decisions in the past few years, as a school community, was to departmentalize our elementary grades starting in first  grade by double subjects for 1-3 (Math/Science and ELA/Social Studies) and single subjects for students in 4-8 grades.  Students are taught all content areas by teachers who are strong in that subject area. Students move to designated  classrooms that offer a rich learning environment specific to the content.    This year we have incorporated strategic partnerships with many new organizations to foster academic experiences  and to strengthen the connection between the larger community and the school. . These presently include, Urban  Advantage, Hall of Science, Ballroom Basix dance program , and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) program.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school is comprised of 10% of students with disabilities. These students are either in our ICT classes or self- contained. These classes, as well as the teachers who teach self-contained and ICT, are also departmentalized to  ensure that the curricula is taught with rigor and the expectation for challenging and higher-level work is transparent.  Our programs are based on the theory and practice of student autonomy and authentic learning.   Our ESL program again is limited. Only ___ % of students. According to Accountability Summary Reports, our ENL  population excels on the NYSITELL exam but lag in their test scores on the NYS ELA exam. Their specific need, moving  forward, will be to incorporate strategies and programs to foster their growth.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the School Quality Guide Framework Elements, our greatest progress over a three year period ( 2016 -  2018) would be under the category of Rigorous Instruction ( 4.07; 4.12; and 4.25 respectively )and Effective School  Leadership (2.90; 3.94; and 4.11 respectively). This was also evident in the 2017-2018 Overall Annual Principal's  Performance Review, which revealed that our success was visible within the measure of Leadership Practice.    Our key area of focus for this year will be based on one element of the Framework. Growth scores which was did not  shown within the component of Supportive Environment. There was little change in scores (3.98; 3.31) over a span of  a two year period. . This was also clear within the same document when looking at the Survey Element scores (2.99;  2.65; and2.57).                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q119   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1277   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Rigorous instruction is required of every teacher in every classroom. This necessity involves creating a strong  philosophy centered on furthering our pedagogy around how our students learn best. This theory of practice will be  to concentrate on student autonomy/authentic learning by furthering our learning to incorporate 'visual thinking'  (Ron Ritchard, 2011)). We have developed numerous teams (i.e. STEM team; Instructional Leadership Team) of  teachers and administrators to focus our attention as a faculty to this end.   Teachers will continue the work of collaborating to achieve our change in pedagogy. Although this theory of pedagogy  has its positive effects on student engagement, it will also help in overcoming some of our academic challenges.   In the 2017-2018 school year, with the help of the assistant principals, our coach, lead teachers, and STEM team  members, who were dedicated to meeting weekly, were able to begin the process of including a STEM program within  our school's curricula. This program was broadened and implemented this year in our kindergarten through eighth  grade classrooms, either singularly or in combination with coding classes. We have since purchased a program to be  an additional supplement to our teacher-created curriculum. Additionally, funds were also made available to hire a  new teacher with experience in this content area.   Although our efforts are ambitious, we realize that it must also prove to increase student growth, specifically with our  English Language Learners (ENL). The results must be framed with the understanding that we do have a small amount  of students that fit in this category ( 26 out of 1274). According to our NYSED Achievement Accountability Report test  score aggregates in ELA, out of 23 students, 13 were Level 1, 5 were Level 2, and 4 students were Level 3 and 4.  Likewise, in mathematics, there was a large discrepancy between Levels 1 and 2 as opposed to Level 3 and 4 (84%  Level 1 and 2; 16% Levels 3 and 4).   As a school we will continue the work of collaborating to achieve our change in pedagogy and will target students that  are English Language Learners. We will continue to focus our work on providing rigorous instructional tasks with the  continuation of student autonomy/authentic learning and provide teachers with multiple strategies, including visible  thinking, to address all student needs but will especially focus our work to offer a supportive environment for our ENL  students. By doing so, our students have a chance to become independent thinkers while using learned skills to  increase academic achievement.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

By June 2019, in order to increase student autonomy and rigor, teachers will utilize the six high-leverage thinking moves  related toward "visible thinking" (Ron Ritchhart) through targeted professional development. This will increase  pedagogy and student learning, including all students but with a special focus on our ENL population. These "thinking  moves" will be measured and will be exhibited in 60% of lessons observed through formal and informal observations.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In 2017-2018, according to the dean's records, as well as the Guidance Counselor's records, there were 10 Respect for  All (RFA) reports. Last year, we recognized what needed to be done in order to reduce this percentage. Our strength  lies in the fact that we recognize the need and are willing to work toward an even more progressive way to quell this  trend. We have already campaigned with students and parents alike to differentiate the definition of bullying and  confrontation.   With this goal in mind, we already had assemblies, guest speakers, parent workshops, and student informational  sessions. According to the responses on the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, 71% of students feel safe in the  hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria. Yet an overall 52% of students felt that what was put in place last  year was effective. Compared to the district average that would be 16% lower than average and 11 % lower when  compared to the city average. Our need for the 2018-2019 school year will be to have our students feel more  supported and safe within the school.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June, 2019, there will be a 5% increase on the 2018-2019 NYC School Quality Guide (52% to 57%) to indicate the  number of students who feel that there is no bullying within the school . This will be accomplished through additional  strategies instituted into our school culture. It will be measured by an increase in the number of positive student  responses on a pre/post survey.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

According to the School Quality Report, 93% of teachers feel that they are actively trying to improve their teaching.  This is a testament to the work that has been done within the school that aligns with research-based theories.   Some of our teachers are not at the same level of improvement. There has been a large number of new hires (10)  within our faculty for the 2018-2019 school. Many of those teachers have taught for under 3 years according to  employment records. Our priority is to support them in every aspect of making a responsible and successful teacher.  These individuals will not only be given a mentor required from the DOE mentoring program to assist in day-to-day  issues but an additional mentor to reinforce the vision of the school and how to implement it into lessons and units of  study.

By June 2019, new teachers will improve their daily lessons and units of study to reflect the focus of the school's beliefs  about how students learn best. The expectation is that the Danielson's Framework components of rigorous instruction  and engagement will be at least one rating increase from the initial to the final observation (ineffective to developing;  developing to effective; effective to highly effective). This will be done using an additional instructional mentor who will  meet at least once a week with the new hire.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to the School Quality Guide 2017-2018, 64% of the teachers state that the professional development  sessions are useful. Although this percentage is relatively high, it is not suitable. To that end, we will offer teachers an  opportunity to lead and actively participate in the work to address professional development geared toward "visible  thinking" aligned with the Authentic Learning Rubric and Danielson's Rubric. Teachers will learn strategies to facilitate  conversations and specifically ask challenging questions and further metacognitive abilities in order to increase  student autonomy and metacognition, specifically with those students in the ENL population.    The priority is to supply the teachers with the opportunity to take ownership of the work. Instructional materials will  be available ( Making Thinking Visible by Ron Ritchhart, 2011). They will incorporate specific components of the  Danielson Rubric based on self-reported needs and combine it with the new information received this year (visible  learning) to further understanding.   The plan to support this will work will be to have specific teams of teachers, created by need, to research and report  out to the faculty, one of the six strategies, how it was applied to their classes through trial lessons, and how they  could be modified to address our population. We will also include in a separate team consisting of coaches, lead  teachers and administrators to monitor the work and provide feedback.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June, 2019, teachers will increase the percentage of positive responses toward the value of the professional  development worth by 5% from the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide to the 2018-2019 results (64% to 69%). The goal  will be met through the use of creating leadership skills and a sense of ownership around the work of this year (visible  thinking). This increase in percentage will improve a positive attitude between teacher needs and the satisfaction rate  of the overall professional learning community. Growth will be measured by the results of the 2018-2019 School Quality  Guide, in-house survey and the fulfillment of the requirements for team presentations.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs.

Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent and family engagement policy that will establish expectations and  objectives for meaningful parent and family involvement in the school community. The Glendale, in compliance with  Section 1116 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent and family engagement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the  school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in  planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively  participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers  and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively  become involved in planning and decision making in support of the education of their children;fostering a caring and  effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress;   providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  sharing  information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages  that parents can understand;  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance  of parents to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community, with the meaningful involvement of parents and family members, will conduct an annual  evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent and family engagement policy with Title I parents to  improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents and family members and enhance the  school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I Parent and Family  Engagement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or  Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent and Family Engagement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To  increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  actively involve and engage parents  and family members in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program as  outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent  and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  engage all parents in discussion and decisions regarding  the required Title I 1% set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the school to supplement parent and family  engagement activities, including family literacy and parenting skills;  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for  parental involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in the school’s Parent and Family  Engagement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students  served in the Title I program must jointly agree upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent  engagement/education to enable parents to effectively support their child’s learning.  support school-level  committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This rationale for choosing this program is anchored in level-appropriate text sets that provide  rigorous instruction. It includes techniques, methodology, and special curriculum designed to  teach ENL students social and academic language skills.  Students for the morning program were based on needs and subgroups according to the EDAT  and RLAT data. (6 students advanced one proficiency level, 3 advanced two levels and 8  remained the same). No student regressed. The data also reveals that the modalities in need that  needs support would be reading and speaking.  This program is differentiated by levels of  proficiency and does address the listening modality through real-world situations.   The supplemental program will be before-school  (Monday through Friday from 7:15 to  8:15).  Materials will include workbooks, texts,and teacher guides. Instruction will be in the four  language domains (listening, speaking, reading, and writing).  This instruction will be in English  and will be taught by our ENL certified teacher.  Our school will carefully monitor the  effectiveness of the morning program and the instructional strategies and activities that go along  with the coordination and integration of the program.   All services including programs supported by NCLB are coordinated to ensure that there are no  duplication of services and ensure equity and access so that all eligible students are provided  with services to expedite their progress towards meeting their annual goal and an increase in  NYSESLAT assessments. Home languages will be supported by word-to-word glossaries,  classroom libraries, and the program translations built in the program.   The program will run for 1 hour each school day (5) for 19 weeks and 4 days, utilizing  the  teacher at ($55.23 hourly wage) as well as, 1 supervisors who will be part of the  program  utilizing approximately 34.4 hours in total ($56.79 hourly wage) for the length of the  program. The ENL teachers will monitor the students’ progress and offer them assistance by  using the feedback from the program to create and implement lessons to improve their  academic language skills in English.

All  classroom teachers that work with our ELL students will be trained to use ELL data and  strategies during instruction.   Records will be kept including agendas and attendance sheets in  the ENL providers office. The result of the following PDs will impact the progress of in-class  strategies to assist ENL students academically and support the morning program. The focus of  these sessions will be based on strategies to assist ENLs who scored at or below the 25th growth  percentile and scored at level 1 or 2 on ELA. 13 % of our students fell within this range. The  modality that must be incorporated within the PD  due to student weaknesses are those of writing  and reading.  The PD within this section will be offered to and will be attended by all teachers with a special  focus for those that are general education teachers within an ENL classroom who support the  work.These sessions will be led by the ENL provider/ administrators on a bi-monthly schedule  for approximately 40 minutes per session during the Monday after school PD time.    The schedule of professional development is as follows:   1. October 16, 2018: Building background knowledge  2. December 19, 2018: Using sentence frames  3.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  There are many formative and summative assessments that are used to determine the needs of the ENL students. Some of  these assessments include the NYSESLAT, ELL periodic assessments,  i-ready diagnostic assessments, Fountas and  Pinnell running records, journals or learning logs to show growth over time in a portfolio, academic conversations to explain  new learning, and student-teacher conference or small group discussions to recount learning.  The ENL Data Anaylsis Tool is  used at the beginning of the year to determine the strength and weakness in each language domain. Based on the NYSESLAT  results for the Spring of 2017, 5% of students scored low in the writing modality however overall 32 % of the ELL population  improved in all language domains and advanced in 1 or 2 proficiency levels; speaking being the highest scored domain.  ELL  periodic assessment trends also show a need for practice in the writing about reading which are supported in the classroom  through strategies like paragraph shrinking, selective highlighting and collaborative learning logs.  Based on our i-ready  diagnostic data and our Fountas and Pinnell running record data, ENL students are scoring at least two or more levels below  grade level in reading.  However, when the data is analyzed more specifically, it becomes clear that the majority of ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      students tested out of the Phonological Awareness. This deficit is being addressed through the use of the Wonders reading  curriculum in our general education classrooms, the Language Power program in our ENL classroom and additional support  with the Wilson Fundations in our RTI program.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At the beginning of the school year, teachers are provided with available state assessment data and begin performing local  assessments such as the i-ready diagnostic exam and the Fountas and Pinnell running record.  Once the data has been  analyzed, teachers look at trends for classes and individual students to determine what aspects of the curriculum have been  successful and which need to be revised.  This is an ongoing process that has become integral in our instructional focus and in  our teacher team practice.  These assessments are repeated and analyzed several times per year as we look for growth and  progress.  Teacher teams meet at least weekly to discuss data and strategies that can be used with particular groups of  students, like our ENL population.  Data is also analyzed on a whole-staff level during professional development time.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments we utilize in order to guide instructional planning for our ELL population are the NYSESLAT, ELL  Periodic Assessments, ELA State Test, and the AYP.  According to the ELL Data Analysis Tool, our 2017 NYSESLAT results  showed that 5% of students scored low in the writing modality which was the lowest of all four of the domains.  However, 32%  of the ELL population improved in all language domains and advanced in 1 to 2 proficiency levels; speaking being the highest  scored domain.  According to the AYP Data, students with limited English proficiency made AYP for the English Language Arts  exam, but did not make it for Mathematics.  Based on the 2017 NYS ELA Item Skills analysis tool,  ENL students overall showed  areas of need in constructed response questions and the reading standards of determining the central message in literature,  making inferences to analyze events, using information to locate information in a text, and inferring word meanings.     In order to identify baseline data, progress and areas of need, we also utilize the i-ready diagnostic for reading and  mathematics.  Using this program helps us to pinpoint student needs in sub-skill levels at least three times per year.  At the  beginning of the school year, all students are administered the i-ready diagnostic which provides data in various sub-skills and  overall functional levels.  We utilize this data not only on the i-ready online site, but also our own platform through which we  can identify struggling students who can be targeted for intervention.  In addition to diagnostic i-ready assessments, teachers  are also able to progress monitor student growth through student performance on individualized lessons which are targeted to  students’ unique areas of need.  This allows us to have ongoing information about whether students are on track to achieve  end-of-year targets.  For example, based on our i-ready reading diagnostic baseline data for this school year, data analysis has  shown that overall, ENL students are scoring at least two or more levels below grade level in reading.  However, when the data  is analyzed more specifically, it becomes clear that the majority of ENL students tested out of the Phonological  Awareness.  The majority of Expanding and Transitioning students also tested out of Phonics and High Frequency Words.  The  areas where the majority of ENLs require assistance according to i-ready data are in Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension of  Literature and Reading Comprehension of Informational Texts.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered it is disseminated to the staff in several ways.  We utilize the professional  development time to discuss findings as a staff and then teacher teams take the data back to their meetings so that they can  adjust curriculum maps and instruction to meet the needs of specific students.  They target skills which need intervention in  the classroom and progress monitor using the available assessment platforms (Fountas and Pinnel, i-ready diagnostics,  etc.)  We also utilize the RTI process to provide Tier I, Tier II and Tier III interventions to students who have been identified as  requiring additional support.  These students are discussed at LAP, PPT, and SIT team meetings and a plan and process for  intervention is developed and implemented.  In addition, based on the data, specific ENL strategies are presented to the staff  for classroom use.  These strategies are research based and are turnkeyed by staff members who have been sent for training.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Throughout the school year, we follow an RTI/PPT Referral protocol within a Multi-Tiered System of Supports to identify  students, including ENLs, who require targeted and systematic interventions as soon as they demonstrate the need.  We utilize  the Fountas and Pinnel Running Record, i-ready diagnostic assessments, and ENL periodic assessments to determine which  students require additional support.  Teachers are consistently providing students with Tier I interventions within the core  curriculum and determining which students require Tier II interventions.  Within the classroom, teachers can provide Tier II  interventions which are in addition to and aligned to the Tier I core curriculum.  These interventions can be provided through  the use of small group instruction, guided reading, and reading intervention programs such as Fundations and Leveled Literacy  Intervention.  In addition, AIS services are provided to targeted classes through the i-ready program.   During these periods,  AIS teachers also provide small group instruction.  If it is determined that Tier I and Tier II interventions are not enough, then a  teacher may submit an RTI/PPT Referral form which is reviewed by both the LAP Team and the PPT Team.  Both teams meet  weekly and review the prior interventions and determine which Tier III interventions and strategies need to be put into place  for the student.  Tier III support is provided by the IEP teacher using programs such as Fundations, Leveled Literacy  Intervention, or REWARDS (used primarily in grades 6-8).  Related Service Providers who may provide at risk services or  additional screenings.  If it is determined that RTI interventions are not successful, then the student can be referred to the  School Based Support Team for an initial evaluation for Special Education.  Bilingual evaluations may also be conducted for  students who are ENLs.   If it is determined that a student requires a Special Education Evaluation, the data collected during  these RTI interventions is considered and included on an IEP if the student is found eligible for services.  In these cases it must  be determined that the supports provided during RTI were not enough to address the student’s needs.             6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In order to evaluate and inform our ENL programs, we use the NYSESLAT and the New York State Common Core English  Language Arts and Math outcome assessments.  We analyze the NYSESLAT data to determine which language modalities and  domains need to be targeted. We review the results of the New York State Common Core English Language Arts and Math  exam item skills analysis documents which allow us to analyze how our students are performing in various skill areas as  compared to the other students in both the city and the state.  Since this document provides student performance in specific  skill areas which are linked to state standards, we are able to determine which standards our students have proved to be  successful in and which standards should be targeted for intervention.  For example, based on the Item Analysis Tool, on the  2017 NYS Common Core ELA exam, ENL students overall showed areas of need in constructed response questions.  They also  demonstrated need in various reading standards of determining the central message in literature, making inferences to  analyze events, using information to locate information in a text, and inferring word meanings.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structures that we have in place to disseminate our findings in order to make adjustments to our programs are utilized  throughout the school year.  Our LAP Team meets weekly to analyze available data and determines which teachers and staff  need to be provided with specific information.  We also utilize professional development time to discuss ENL needs and  instruction with the entire staff.  Teacher teams use the NYS Common Core ELA and Math Item Analysis tools to analyze how  our students are performing in specific skills and standards.  The administration also meets with individual teacher to analyze  the results of their individual students so that instruction can be targeted toward these skills and specific populations like our  ENL students.  NYSESLAT results are analyzed and presented to the staff by our ENL teacher.  Our ENL teacher also collaborates  with general education teachers to be sure that students’ needs in the classroom are supported in her class as well.  In order to  disseminate i-ready data, we utilize the previously mentioned platform which can be filtered to analyze data on ENL  performance and needs.           Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding ENL Program:  Students in the program are grouped by ungraded and heterogeneous in proficiency  levels. The ENL provider conducts stand alone in ENL for the units of study mandated by the CR154. During the Stand- Alone program, the ENL teacher focuses on language development through content. The program that is used to drive  instruction is Language Power. This program focuses on techniques, methodology, and special curriculum designed to  teach ELL students social and academic English language skills through content. Integrated services mandated by the  CR 154, are provided within content area classes.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:   N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:   N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The organization of the staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to  proficiency levels. (CR Part 154). We have one ENL teacher who uses the Freestanding ENL model. She pulls students out of  their general education classes according to their individual levels. Entering/Emerging ENL students get a total of 360 minutes  of ENL;180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive a total of  360 minutes of ENL, 90 minutes stand alone, 180 integrated ENL/ELA and/or  90 minutes ENL within ELA or a content area.  Transitioning/Expanding ELLs receive a total of 180 stand-alone minutes of ENL; 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA .  Expanding ELLs receive a total of 180 minutes in integrated service. Students who are commanding receive a total of 90  minutes of ENL in ELA or any other content area.  Both the ENL and dual certified content area teachers work with the ELL  students in the content classrooms.    Eight periods (4/4) are given to entering students pull out and push in by the ENL provider; For emerging students, the ENL  provider delivers four period of instruction via stand-alone and integrated service. For transitioning and expanding students,  the four additional teachers who hold an ENL license push in to classrooms to assist students with content work for four  periods.   Former ELLs receive .5 units of ENL per week.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All ENL providers use the Engage NY New Language Arts Progression guide to identify the Main Academic Demand of every  Common Core anchor standard as well as the Linguistic Demand to help identify the words, phrases and forms of language  that students will need to understand and use in order to meet the Common Core standards within our Freestanding ENL  program. ELL students are given integrated support in the content areas of mathematics, English, science, and social studies.  Instruction is differentiated for the ELL students depending on the ELL language level. The instructional approaches and  methods used to make content comprehensible are Verbal Scaffolding, Procedural Scaffolding and Instructional Scaffolding.  Teachers use prompting, questioning and elaboration to facilitate students movement to higher levels of language proficiency,  comprehension and thinking. Teachers also use a variety of learning activities that connect new content to students’ prior  knowledge.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ENL students are screened using linguistically and culturally appropriate screening tools to determine what supports and  services they need. Screening tools include NYSITELL, Spanish-Lab, and ELL periodic exams. In addition, ENL students also  receive support in their home language by using bilingual glossaries, translators, and state exams in their home language.  Classroom teachers also provide materials and exams in the students’ home languages.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for our ENL subgroups by using  Differentiated Strategies with Assessment Data. Teachers analyze  their assessments and determine the appropriate scaffolds to use for each subgroup.  Entering and Emerging students at this  level are provided instruction in both stand-alone and integrated service.  The ENL teacher utilizes the Language Power  program to support the various ELL subgroups.  Language Power provides both content and language objectives.  Teachers use  a variety of scaffolds that target the content and linguistic demand that students will require. Entering students, for example,  will be able to develop their listening, reading, speaking and writing skills by focusing on key words in text, while emerging  students will focus on key phrases and short sentences in the new language. Transitioning and Expanding students are  provided with integrated support within their content. Teachers focus on incorporating the types of texts, vocabulary and  tasks used in core subjects by planning activities that tap into their auditory, visual and kinesthetic students preference.  Commanding students work independently but are provided with scaffolds based on student need.  SIFE students are provided  with differentiated phonics instruction to build phonemic awareness and knowledge of language and print.  Former ELLs are  still provided with ELL accommodations for up to two years after achieving commanding status.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the content area teacher using the units of study to determine the grade level  materials to use. The ENL teacher uses the Language Power program which targets both a content objective and a language  objective. Some instructional strategies that teachers use are linking background knowledge and culture to learning, focusing  on vocabulary enrichment, using visuals/pictures, and models, as well as increasing comprehensible input and language  output.  In addition, teachers have been trained in the use of anticipation guides, collaborative-strategic-reading learning,  concept sorts, first line strategies, possible sentence strategies, paragraph shrinking, selective highlighting, seed discussions,  summarizing, and exit slips.  These strategies are embedded into daily lessons so that ELL-SWDs can gain access to the general  curriculum.  In grades K-2, the Wonders program is being utilized to support language development within the general  education classroom. This program provides daily explicit and systematic instruction in developing phonics and phonological  skills, phonemic awareness, fluency and confidence with high frequency words through the use of complex texts.  Additionally,  teachers use I-Ready adaptive diagnostic cross grade level assessments to accelerate English language development. The I- ready program also provides individualized instruction to meet each student’s unique needs.  Our RTI program also provides  elementary ELLs and SDW with targeted instruction in the Wilson Fundations Language Training Program.  This program  teaches foundational skills in reading, writing, speaking listening and language.  The Leveled Literacy Intervention program is  also being utilized for RTI within the general education classroom to support students in guided reading, phonics, and fluency  development.  In addition, the RTI program also utilizes the REWARDS reading program in middle school to further develop  phonemic awareness and reading of multi-syllabic words in context.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Within the Continuum of Services available to Students with Disabilities, ELL students are programmed appropriately according  to their IEPs.  The stand-alone ELL program allows the ENL teacher to work with students with IEPs in her classroom using the  Language Power reading curriculum.  The ENL teacher refers to student IEP goals so that her instruction can be in alignment  with the goals that have been put forth in the student’s IEP and in supporting the student in the Least Restrictive Environment   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      (LRE).  Schedules are flexible to ensure that services do not conflict and so that ELL-SWDs are able to receive all of their  services throughout the school day.  Instructionally, all teachers differentiate for ENL-SWDs within the LRE and adhere to IEP  goals and benchmarks.  ENL-SWDs are also invited to the ENL morning program during which they can receive additional  remedial help in language acquisition.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At  P.S. 119 we use the Language Power program for targeted intervention. This program gives students the effective tools  they need to achieve academic success in English literacy and English proficiency. This includes the academic language needed  to access core curriculum and meaningful contexts for communication in social, intercultural, and instructional settings.  Newcomers- This program includes A web-based learning system that helps newcomers and struggling readers develop  reading skills as they move through fun and interactive tutorials, eBooks, practice exercises, and graded activities  Developing-Advanced- These students are exposed to a fast-paced and enjoyable system that stresses verbal and written  communication with an emphasis on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation for young adults and adults. This program  allows the use of a content-based approach to help students acquire content knowledge, skills, and English literacy through  civics education and citizenship  In ELA, Math, and other core content areas teacher use different ELL intervention strategies such as gestures, small group  instruction, partnered activities, graphic organizers, sentence stems and direct vocabulary instruction. Students are also given  glossaries, dictionaries and other content material in their home language.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the data trends, the new programs that will be offered for the upcoming school year will be Continental’s Finish Line  New York Ell’s. This series gives grade level practice in multiple-choice, written response, and oral response questions from  across four common domains: listening, reading, writing and speaking. This practice helps minimize test day anxiety, which  allows students more opportunity to display their content knowledge and language proficiency. Within the general education  classrooms, K-2 students will also be receiving instruction using the Wonders literacy program.  This program provides daily  explicit and systematic instruction in developing phonics and phonological skills, phonemic awareness, fluency and confidence  with high frequency words through the use of complex texts.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ENL students are offered all access to morning and after school programs and clubs. Morning Extra Help is offered by the ENL  provider to assist students in developing their speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. The school includes curricular  programming in content areas and performing arts. Extracurricular activities include robotics, sports, and Spanish club. All  students including ENL students are invited to participate via permission slip in the parents preferred language.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials that are used to support ENL students are Building Fluency through Reader’s Theater, Focused  Reading Intervention, and Write Time For Kids. The I-Ready computer program is used in Math and ELA, using laptops with  translations, native language dictionaries and glossaries are used to support ENL students in all content areas including social  studies and science. All materials are additionally used for subgroups. I-Ready is leveled to match students’ present level of  achievement in language and math skills and provides them with individualized instruction at their level as well as grade level  materials.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Within our ENL program, home language is supported in various ways.  In our stand alone program, ENL students are provided  with glossaries, vocabulary in their home language and different types of reading texts in their home language so that they can  interpret the texts in English.  As part of phonological and metalinguistic awareness, in order to facilitate reading acquisition in  all subjects, students are asked to: say words that start with the same sound(s) in English or the L1, find how words are  changed and formed in the home language (singular and plural forms, present tense and past tense forms of verbs), enhance  their word knowledge, and read books in their home language to show what they know about reading.  Within the integrated  classroom, students are also provided with glossaries.  These glossaries may be provided in paper format or electronic  format.  Many students prefer to utilize google translate and teachers have technology devices available for their  use.  Teachers may also provide vocabulary lists and key terms for the students so that they can grapple with the text on their  own, but with vocabulary support.  In terms of curriculum documents or texts, teachers provide translated versions of the  texts and materials on a daily basis so that students can gain access to the English texts or materials.  During the state Math  and Science exams, ENL students are offered the accommodation of having the exam in their home language, side by side with  the English version of the exams.  Materials used include but are not limited to text in native languages, computer programs  for comprehension, and dictionaries.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   When a new student arrives at our school, the Intake Team goes through the process of enrolling the student in several  ways.  First, the Pupil Secretary gathers necessary documentation from the family to determine the child's age, appropriate  grade, and home language.  Once the student has been enrolled, the ENL teacher provides the home language survey to  determine if the student would qualify for NYSITELL testing in order to place the student in the proper program and provide  the mandated services.  If the student qualifies for ENL services, the student is placed in the appropriate ENL program and  begins receiving services and resources.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are not currently sharing our building.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the beginning of the school year, as well as during, the parent coordinator conducts workshops specific to the needs of ELL  students and their families.  Families are identified and referred to various school personnel for workshops and assistance as  determined by their individual need.  Outreach to community groups is often a part of support that is offered by the guidance  counselor, parent coordinator, and ENL teacher.   Upon entering the school, the guidance counselor has a entry meeting with  the child to discuss the program and any concerns the child might have.    In addition, the ENL teacher meets with the family to  determine the appropriate placement for the student and to complete assessments.  If the student is an ENL-SWD, the family  is referred to the IEP teacher and to the School Based Support Team to ensure that appropriate placement and scheduling are  put in place as per the student's IEP.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Mandarin/Spanish      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:   Not Applicable     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Professional development is offered for ELL personnel at our school in various different ways.  In order to receive on-going  professional development, the ENL teacher attends bi-monthly meetings offered by the Queens North Field Support Center in  ELL-specific professional development.  The ENL teacher attends professional development offerings in topics such as effective  ENL strategies, ELL compliance, strategies for newcomers and SIFE students, and content area strategies.  Professional development to the teaching, guidance, school-based support team, related service providers, and  paraprofessional staff as well as the parent coordinator, is offered during the Monday professional development time.  This  professional development may be led by the administration, ENL teacher or point teachers who are working with ENL  students.  During PD time, topics which are covered include a close look at CR514, proficiency levels and what they mean for  instruction, instruction of high frequency words, the use of anticipation guides, collaborative-strategic reading and learning,  Marzano’s Nine Essential Instructional Strategies and Six Step Process in Teaching Academic Vocabulary, concept sorts, first  line activities, paragraph shrinking, selective highlighting, seed discussions, summarizing, collaborative learning logs, and exit  slips.  After the staff receives PD on these topics, they are asked to track their use in the classroom by targeting ENL students  and determining which strategies were successful based on student work and evidence.  Teachers are then asked to reflect on  their practice and determine if the strategies would be used again on these students or if a different intervention should be  tried.  All of these strategies are used in conjunction with the CCLS and help to address the level of rigor and high expectations  that are help for all students.  Non-pedagogic staff such as secretaries and school aides are provided with PD on an as needed basis and are trained in the  needs and requirements for ELL students.   Secretaries are trained in working with families during the intake process and utilize  translators and translation services when interacting with parents on a regular basis.  They also ensure that all memos and  notices which are to be sent home to parents are available in the necessary home languages.  School aides are also trained in  utilizing translation services when working with ELL students or parents and are often called upon to be translators  themselves, especially during state exam administrations.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In order to meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2, all teachers are provided with professional  development and support in working with and supporting ELL students.  All teachers are provided with professional  development in regards to ELLs during Monday professional development time.  In addition to this time, the ENL teacher also  attends professional development opportunities outside of the school building on a bi-monthly.  Records of these activities are  kept through the use of agendas, attendance, teacher/student work, and reflections.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During Tuesday parent outreach time, the ENL teacher reaches out to the parents of our ENL students to update them  on their  child's progress.  She reviews their language development, any updated proficiency results and the individual child's strengths  and needs.  The ENL teacher also meets with parents four times per year during Parent-Teacher conferences during which time  updates to language program goals and overall progress in all subject areas can be discussed. The ENL teacher also reviews the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            student's ENL portfolio with the parent and addresses any parent concerns. Portfolios of student work are given to the  provider via the content area teachers for review with the parent.  Interpretation/translation is conducted either by another  person or the DOE translation unit.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our school fosters involvement from parents of ELLs in various ways.  In order to facilitate oral communication we utilize  interpretation and translation services during daily interactions, parent conferences, and workshops.  In addition, Google  Translate is available on our school website as well as in our testing app (REMIND) which has a translation component.  Multi- lingual parent literature is available in the parent coordinator's office and all school notices are available in translated versions  based on our parents' preferred languages.  Parent Coordinator and ENL provider conduct workshops activities specific to the  needs of ELL parents. Specific workshops include: 1. Involvement of families with their children in learning activities at home,  including homework and other curricular-linked activities. 2. Providing parental education that includes family literacy and  understanding school community 3. Implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate practices in all aspects of  communication. 4. Understanding ENL identification, assessments, and programs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jeanne Fagan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/IS 119 The Glendale                                                                              School DBN: 24Q119  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
