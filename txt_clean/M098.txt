This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Public School 98 Manhattan’s Mission: To develop a plan to support the school community in creating and shaping an  outcome driven educational system. Staff members, parents, and the community will be actively engaged in the  process of sharing the vision, and contributing to its achievement.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We believe in educating the whole child by creating opportunities for students to discover and grow their interests  and talents while ensuring that we adhere to the CCLS. We offer a rigorous academic program, while supporting the  needs of our diverse learners. We recognize that parental involvement is essential to the academic success of our  students. To that end, we have formed partnerships with outside organizations and created school wide opportunities  for students and parents to become engaged in the educational process. Last year, PS 98 revitalized our partnership  with the Carmel Hill Fund Educational Program in implementing STAR Reading and Accelerated Reader. The STAR  Reading Enterprise pairs instruction with student ability and measures annual student growth. The frequent  assessments, immediate feedback, and pupil engagement experienced with this program align with our focus for this  school year.    We will continue our partnership with MasteryConnect which provides bi-weekly professional development to  teachers on using formative assessment to track and monitor student progress. Teachers are learning to focus  assessments on individual standards in an effort to better identify students who are struggling to understand specific  concepts and provides resources for teaching through their online system.      We are receiving support from the Division of Specialized Instruction and Student Support which assists our teachers  in obtaining the knowledge needed to construct and conduct rigorous, data driven lessons to support our goals and  visions for the school.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Public School 98 Manhattan, Shorackappock School is located in the Inwood section of upper Manhattan. It was built  in 1923 and originally served the community as a 1st through 8th grade school; presently, we are a Pre-K to 5th grade  school. We currently have 475 students enrolled; 93.05% Hispanic, 0.18%, black, 4.21 white, and 1.05 Multiracial. Our  student population is comprised of 52.21% male and 47.79% female.    PS98 has modified our programs to better serve our community. We offer parents a choice of Dual Language,  Transitional Bilingual, and Monolingual programs. Additionally, we offer services for Students with Disabilities  including Self-Contained Special Education classes, Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) and Special Education Teacher  Support Services (SETSS)    We are receiving support from the Division of Specialized Instruction and Student Support which assists our teachers  in obtaining the knowledge needed to construct and conduct rigorous, data driven lessons to support our goals and  visions for the school. The School Improvement Specialist will be specifically guiding our Special Education Teachers to  plan and implement lesson that are differentiated based on data gleaned from frequent assessments.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      In reviewing the results of the Quality Review 2017-2018, and after analyzing data for the 2017-2018 school year,the  School Leadership Team observed that the following areas are identified as strengths for PS98:   1.1 Ensuring engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned  to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards.   3.4 Establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and  provide supports to achieve those expectations. Engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an  inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning.   4.2 Engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared  leadership and focuses on improved student learning.   The School Leadership Team also observed that the following areas were identified as areas of growth for our school:   1.2 Developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of  all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products. Specifically, we were inconsistent in the use of  multiple entry points.   2.2 Aligning assessments to curricula, using on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyzing information on  student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels. Specifically, we were  inconsistent in using checks for understanding to guide instructional decisions.   After analyzing our data, feedback from our Quality Review, and our current practices, we have identified as our focus  for the current school year, Rigor to Engage Students in Learning and Use of Assessments in Instruction. Specifically,  we will focus on:   Frequent assessments with multiple opportunities for improvement     Providing explicit instruction      Checks for understanding    Providing frequent and timely feedback    Questioning and discussion techniques         Our teacher teams will focus on creating formative assessments, using data to make instructional decisions, and  provide students with multiple opportunities for improvement to demonstrate growth (1E and 3B). Teacher Team  Meetings will include the planning of multiple entry points to address the needs of all groups of learners specifically,  the SWD and ELL population. Administrators will ensure that these measures are practiced regularly by periodically  attending Teacher Team Meetings, conducting frequent walk-throughs and providing timely feedback to support  teachers.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M098   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   469   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Our Pre-K staff attends in-house and city-wide professional development to ensure that students have a smooth  transition to Kindergarten socially, emotionally, and academically. Our Pre-K curriculum is developmentally  appropriate, adheres to New York State Pre-kindergarten Foundation for the Common Core and is fully aligned to the  overall goals of the school. Our Pre-K teachers are currently using the DOE Units of Study. Parents are invited to  attend workshops in our school ( every month) which cover a variety of topics. Workshops address specific needs of  Pre-K families and help to build a sense of community. During the school year, teachers familiarize students with the  school environment and expectations. In May, we will conduct a workshop titled “Transitioning to Kindergarten” to  familiarize the parents with the Kindergarten curriculum, routines, and expectations. The workshop is provided in  collaboration by the Pre-K Teachers and the UPK Social Worker. Also in May, we conduct tours of the Kindergarten  Mini-Building for our Pre-K parents and students. In addition, our Pre-K Social Worker and Family Worker work closely  with the families throughout the year to prepare them for the transition to Kindergarten.   Early Intervention Services are provided by SEIT providers as their students are assigned to our school. The SEIT  provider works closely with the classroom teacher and paraprofessional to assure that the student has a smooth  transition from home services, to services in Pre-K, and eventually into Kindergarten. The school houses a UPK ICT  class.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our school created a committee of school-based members. Members of the committee received appropriate training.  The committee met and discussed the MOSL options and came to a consensus. The committee shared the process  and the decisions with the staff.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective and consistent  involvement of parents and community in the school. Shorackappock School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Shorackappock School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association and Title I Parent  Committee;   ● Supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Success Academy, an ELA and Math enrichment program will be offered to students in grades 3-5 on Wednesday and  Thursday from 2:30 pm-4:30 pm for two 10-week cycles beginning in October and January. From 9:00 am-12 :00 pm,  Saturday Academy will also be offered to students in grades 3-5 for two 8-week cycles beginning in October and  January. Combined, both programs will reach 140 students.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, in partnership with The Leadership Program, PS 98 will have provided at least 30 hours of afterschool  and day time programming to 250 students. By June 2019, 95% of students enrolled in 21st Century Community  Learning Centers Activities will achieve 90 hours of programming.      By June 2019, students in grades 3-5 will show progress in ELA as indicated in a 10% decrease of level 1 students in  the 2019 state evaluation assessments.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  After school enrichment activities will promote active lifestyles and creative expression resulting in students that are  less stressed and more engaged in school activities. The homework help that will be provided to students before  enrichment activities will ease academic pressures felt by students and their families at home and encourage a  healthy work-life balance. To foster leadership and social skills and lower risk-taking behaviors, students in grades 4-5  enrolled in the after school enrichment program will participate in The Leadership Program’s boys and girls mentoring  groups.       The Leadership Program will deliver 5 parent workshops from their Building Family Series throughout the 2018-2019  school year in the areas of interest indicated by parental feedback in the 2018 Community School Forum. These  workshops will give parents the tools needed to support their children in their academic, social and emotional  learning.       The Leadership Program will also provide 3 professional development workshops for school based staff to enhance  and expand personal, professional and pedagogical skills.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      In the classroom, individualized instruction in small groups will allow students to gain prerequisite skills to grade level  expectations as outlined by Common Core Standards and district level leadership.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Almost 50% of those students have been in the U.S. for only one year.After having  carefully reviewed the 2017-2018 STAR Reading data and the preliminary 2018 State ELA/Math  exams data of our ELLs for patterns and trends, we have determined that our ELL population is  mostly performing at Levels 1 and 2. Also, the NYSESLAT data shows that our ELL population  needs support in developing their academic language, reading comprehension, and, especially,  their writing skills. Furthermore, the Spanish LAB-R and Spanish ELE exams tell us that many  new arrivals have academic deficiencies in their first language.  Our goal is to achieve equity of instruction for our ELLs. In order to accomplish this goal, we  will implement a strong academic ELL Supplemental Title III academic program using ENL best  practices and methodologies t enhance maintain and sustain academic English through core  content areas.As part of the implementation of the strong ELL support system, we have initiated  a supplementary Saturday Title III instructional program for ELLs (Saturday Academy). The  program will run for 19 sessions from October 2018 through March 2019. The sessions will take  place at P.S. 98 from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon.    Entering and Emerging levels (mostly newcomer ELLs)  ·  Transitioning and Expanding levels:  ·  ·  ·  Entering and emerging students will receive more intense, skill-driven activities through the  Imagine Learning program, whereas the transitioning and expanding students will receive more  enrichment through research-based Literacy and Math programs.    We will have 3 certified ENL/bilingual certified teachers, servicing students in grades 3, 4, and  5. Teachers will use non-fiction texts for ELA instruction. Math instruction will be delivered in  Spanish to supplement our dual language program.If we do not have sufficient ENL/bilingual  teachers for the program, we will follow district’s protocol for hiring qualified teachers.There  will be 1 (one) administrator supervising the Saturday program exclusively for its duration and 1  (one) administrator supervising the After-School program .  The supervisor's hours for Saturday  Academy are from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. and for the After School program the hours will be  from 3:30-4:30. The supervisor will monitor instruction, support teacher development, and help  with identifying effective teaching strategies. The supervisor has extensive training in state  mandates for ELLs and has been exposed to the curriculum and regulations of the ELLs.  Parents  will be offered workshops to provide strategies they can use with their children at home, in order  to support them in ELA and Math.

These materials are used  exclusively with our Title program and not during the regular school day. Materials will be  purchased using Title III funds. Through these resources, the ELL students engage with  challenging and authentic texts from traditional and contemporary literature, and non-fiction  texts related to ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies. Technology will be incorporated into all  lessons. Teachers will differentiate instruction to meet the needs of ELLs using a variety of  instructional strategies, including but not limited to scaffolding, graphic organizers, modeling  and retelling, sequencing, various assessment strategies, and accountable talk.Students with  proficiency levels of transitioning,  or expanding, will engage in guided reading, writing and  skill-based literacy instruction.Attendance will be taken at every lesson and archived; our Parent  Coordinator will reach out to parents of children who are absent or decline the offer to  participate. Students' progress will be monitored and a file will be maintained for each student.  The teachers will track student progress through the STAR Literacy Assessment, teacher- generated assessments, and conference notes. The Imagine Learning progress/growth data will  also be informative because this technology program differentiates for all students and targets  specific weaknesses identified in the diagnostic assessment and formative assessment  data.Parents will be informed about the Saturday Academy program via our School Messenger,  letters backpacked with students, and the school calendar distributed monthly.

These goals has been established based on our parents’ needs, which were evaluated through  formal interviews and informal conversations during the school's parental engagement hours,  parent teacher conferences, workshops, school events, and PTA meetings. Staff and the  administration make every effort possible to answer any questions and concerns that parents may  have. Parents provide valuable information about their children, their background, strengths and  weaknesses, behavior and academic work as well as their socioeconomic situation.  The P.S. 98M administrators, teachers, social workers, invited speakers and the Parent  Coordinator will provide the presentations. The workshops will be conducted in English and  Spanish. Interpretation will be provided for parents who do not speak English and/or Spanish  either by DOE staff and/or the Department of Education Translation Services.  These are some of the presentations/activities we have planned that we believe will foster  parental involvement for parents of ELLs:  - Partnership with the organization Literacy Inc. which provides a program for parents which  teaches them how to improve their children's reading and writing skills at home, how to select  grade appropriate text for your child, engage in academic conversation with your child, the role  trips play in student learning, math games that could be played at home, etc. These meetings will  take place once a month for 1 hour.  - Our school partners with Inwood Community Services and Washington Heights Coalition that  provide workshops or services to the ELLs and their parents.  - Annual ELL Conference held by SLT in collaboration with PA once a year with the support of  the administration and the teachers who offer workshops and conferences for parents.  - Family Game Night - takes place at P.S. 98 every year. Parents of ELLs interact with their  children and other families.  - Family Movie Night - held at P.S. 98 once a year. The school auditorium is converted into a  cinema and parents have an opportunity to spend quality time with their children, other family  members, and the members of the community.  - Parent Coordinator led workshops for parents - every month the parent coordinator has a  workshop for parents including the parents of ELLs. The topics range from how to read together  with their children, help their children with homework, work with the teacher of your children, to  how to help their children learn to take responsibility, the ABCs of discipline at home,  understanding the Common Core, reading aloud to children, and how to use technology to access  child's data. Other topics will be generated as per parent requests or needs.  All the parental engagement activities will be at no cost to Title III.  Parents will be notified of all meetings, workshops, shows, events held at P.S. 98M through via  our School Messenger, e-mail, monthly school calendar, fliers, parent brochures, and letters in  the parents' language of choice as indicated on the Home Language Identification Survey.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We evaluate students' growth in various assessments and use multiple sources of data to make instructional-based decisions  and guide planning and group formation.      Our school uses the following tools to assess the early literacy skills of the English Language Learners (ELLs):      - STAR Early Literacy and Literacy (administered 3 times a year)  - DRA (twice a year)  - Running Records   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      - Wilson Assessment of Decoding and Encoding (WADE)     To monitor the academic growth of our ELLs, we rely on the following assessments:     - Accelerated Reader book quizzes (enable teachers to monitor the quantity and quality of reading practice engaged in by the  students)  - Ready Gen performance-based assessment (writing)  - Math problem solving  - Guided reading conference notes  - Estrellita (Grades K-2)  - Teacher-made assessments (rubrics, checklists) aligned to the curriculum  - Pre- and post- RTI reading assessments     The data collected from these assessments provide us with the insights into the growth of our ELLs - which students make  progress, plateau or lag behind. This helps us plan targeted lessons that meet the needs of our students.     In addition, the assessments are helpful in planning professional development sessions for teachers focused on how to move  the ELL students forward. We can use the assessments to identify trends in the data and then focus on those areas to develop  professional competencies within our staff.    Last but not least, the assessments help us evaluate the efficacy of our programs and instruction and modify as needed based  on the results.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We possess licenses for the assessments and work with an AP/Testing Coordinator, and a Reading Specialist to coordinate the  assessments. We work with the organization Reading Matters that provides professional development and support so that  teachers can make instructional decisions based on the data gathered. In addition, we coordinate with the Literacy Coach and  Math Coach on content-based assessments and data talks.     We consider it a success when the data from our formative assessments show that our students meet and  exceed NYS Standards, make progress in their acquisition of a new language, develop English proficiency, or proficiency in the  target language (for the students in our dual language program), or test out of NYSESLAT.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  - ELA and Math State Exams  - NYSESLAT  - El Examen de Lectura en Español (ELE) (to test students’ vocabulary knowledge and ability to understand words in context)  - EDEL  - Home Language Arts Spanish Performance Assessment  - STAR     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We work with the organization Reading Matters that provides professional development and support so that teachers can  make instructional decisions based on the data gathered. In addition, we coordinate with the Literacy Coach and Math Coach  to analyze the results of content-based assessments and conduct data talks.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      As a school community, we collect and analyze the data throughout the year, discuss the areas of need, and make decisions  about the programs, placements of students, as well as any additional supports needed.     At Tier I, all ELL students are provided with whole-class instruction and small-group instruction (guided reading and math  groups) from their general education teacher. Bilingual teachers use ENL strategies and native language support to make  content comprehensible. The support of ELLs in monolingual classrooms is provided by the ENL teachers via the standalone  ENL and/or integrated ENL/ELA or other content area model.      At Tier II, our at-risk ELLs receive small-group instruction services via a push-in and/or pull-out model by a SETSS teacher and  an RtI Reading specialist (we are working on securing an RtI Math teacher). The Tier II instruction is a supplement to the core  curriculum. Through the interventions employed in Tier II we address any barriers that impede the academic performance of  our ELLs. ENL and bilingual teachers provide mandated language support to the ELL students using the ENL strategies and  native language support.     Tier III includes the students who do not make adequate progress with the RtI services in Tier II. Those students are referred to  our Pupil Personnel Team (PPT). The team evaluates all the academic variables and the remediation that has taken place for  those students. If needed, the students are referred to our School Assessment Team (SAT) for further  assessments/evaluations, whereby the students maybe placed. Bilingual teachers scaffold the instruction of the ELLs in Tier III  using the ENL strategies and natives language support. The ELLs in monolingual programs continue receiving the mandated  services from the ENL teachers.     The RtI team and classroom teachers use the following intervention programs and materials:     - Fountas and Pinnell leveled guided reading books  - The Spalding Method  - Wilson Fundations  - Teacher-developed materials/Units of Study  - Pre-Referral Intervention Manual (PRIM)  - Reading and Writing Sourcebook from Great Source  - Strategies from the books Asking Better Questions by N. Morgan and Making Thinking Visible by R. Ritchhart  - Strategies from the Explicit Direct Instruction by John Hollingsworth     All RtI services, interventions, and assessment tools are documented via students portfolios, teacher data binders, professional  development, PPT meetings, special education meetings, and RtI meetings.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     We share the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT, ELA and Math data including the data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) with the  teachers and students' related services providers     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  A review of the NYSITELL and NYSELAT results demonstrates that most of the students in our school are either at the  intermediate (emerging/transitioning) or advanced (expanding) level of their English language acquisition. It appears that the  younger the students are, the more likely they are to be at the beginning (entering) and intermediate (emerging/transitioning)  level, unless the students are newcomers.     The review of the tests' results also demonstrates that ELLs at all grade levels develop listening and speaking skills first and  then develop reading and writing skills. ELLs at the beginning level show stronger listening and speaking skills than reading and  writing. ELLs at the intermediate level demonstrate growing ability in reading while their writing still needs significant  improvement. ELLs at the advanced level demonstrate a considerable growth in their writing ability.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61            With more intensive work in the area of reading comprehension and written expression, our expectations are that the  students will move more quickly from the intermediate (emerging/transitioning) to the advanced (expanding) level, and from  the advanced (expanding) to the proficient (commanding) level.     Our NYSESLAT results are consistent with the research regarding the stages of the acquisition of a new language: first the child  develops the speaking and listening competency, followed by reading, and then writing. These patterns help us plan  differentiated small-group instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our Freestanding ENL Program provides instruction in English with supports emphasizing English language acquisition.  It is based on the standalone ENL and integrated ENL/ELA (or other content area) models. During the stand-alone ENL  instruction students develop English language skills so that they can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by  our two ENL teachers. During integrated ENL instruction students build English language skills through content area  instruction. It is delivered by co-taught by our certified ENL teachers and certified content area teachers (common  branch and/or social studies), and it will be provided by a dually certified teacher in the event that we create a self- contained ENL classroom.     Currently ENL is delivered via the stand-alone/small group and integrated models. In the integrated model, our  ENL teachers work collaboratively/co-teach with classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary  support. In the stand-alone model, we bring together ELLs from various classes for small-group, individualized English  acquisition-focused instruction in the English language, reading, writing, and content areas where applicable. Our goal  is to align the ELL instruction with the CCLS and with our school's curriculum.     When we place ELLs in small groups, we strive to group them homogeneously into categories with the same  proficiency level based on their performance levels obtained from the latest NYSESLAT results and also the NYSITELL  scores for new ELLs (entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding). When ELLs in the dual-language  program reach commanding level, they remain in the class as English-Proficient students.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Our Transitional Bilingual Education program helps ELL students develop conceptual skills in the Spanish language as  they learn English. All instruction is Common Core-aligned. It consists of ENL, Language Arts (Spanish and English), and  at least two subjects in the native language at the beginning levels (math, science, and/or social studies). The ENL  component helps students develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English, and the Spanish  Language Arts component helps students develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish. The  classes alternate between English and Spanish instruction following the balanced literacy model, and the ENL support  is provided by the bilingual teacher in the classroom. The TBE classes are formed heterogeneously, however, teachers  can group students homogeneously in the classroom depending on the needs of the students. As ELLs develop English  language skills, time in the Spanish language decreases. When ELLs reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they are  placed in a monolingual class in English with home language supports.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         Our Dual Language program serves both ELL students in need to English language development and monolingual  English-proficient students who are interested in learning Spanish. It consists of the following components: an ENL  component to help students develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English; a Spanish Language  Arts component to help students develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish; and content  area instructional component (math, science, social studies) taught in English and Spanish.  All dual language classes  alternate between English and Spanish instruction following the balanced literacy model, and the ENL support is  provided by the classroom teacher in the classroom.     The primary language acquisition goals of our Dual Language program is the development of grade-level-appropriate  biliteracy and academic skills in English and Spanish.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The ENL teachers, the Principal, and other staff members are continuously working to develop a schedule for the ELL students  in each grade and proficiency level that is compliant with the CR Part 154 regulations.     We currently have two full-time ENL teachers on staff to provide the ENL services. In the beginning of the school year, after  the completion of the NYSITELL testing, the ENL teachers design schedules. Great care is taken to ensure that student groups  are set up to allow for the number of required instructional minutes:     Entering - standalone: 180 min, integrated ENL/ELA: 180 min, total: 360 min  Emerging - standalone: 90 min, integrated ENL/ELA: 180 min, standalone or integrated: 90 min, total: 360 min  Transitioning – integrated ENL/ELA: 90 min, standalone or integrated: 90 min, total: 180 min  Expanding - integrated ENL/ELA or other content area: 180 min, total: 180 min  Commanding – integrated ENL/ELA or other content area: 90 min, total: 90 min    The bilingual (TBE and DL) classes' schedules are set up to fulfill the required minutes for ENL instruction. The schedules are  arranged to ensure that the mandated number of units of Home Language Arts instruction per week as outlined in CR Part 154,  in both TBE and DL programs, are met.     The transitional bilingual education (TBE) classes adhere to the appropriate language allocation of units according to each  student's NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores. Literacy instruction is delivered through English Language Arts using ENL methodologies  and Spanish Language Arts. Social Studies and Science are taught in English and Spanish on alternating days. Math is taught in  Spanish. At the entering level, our TBE students receive about 75% of instruction in Spanish and 25% in English. As their English  proficiency increases, more of the instructional day is spent learning in English.     Dual Language (DL) classes adhere to a 50/50 language allocation policy. Grades K-2 alternate language every day (instruction  is delivered in L1 on day 1 and in L2 on day 2). Grades 3-5 have English and Spanish AM and PM cycles (during week 1,  instruction is delivered in L1 in the mornings and in L2 in the afternoons; during week 2, instruction is delivered in L2 in the  mornings and in L1 in the afternoons; etc.).     Both transitional and dual language classes are taught by fully certified bilingual teachers who are responsible for conducting  the instruction in both English and Spanish. All transitional bilingual classes are organized heterogeneously to encourage peer  interaction and support. Our philosophy is predicated on children being able to learn from each other and to promote each  other's academic growth.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Our goal is to align all ELL programs with the comprehensive core curriculum. The programs for ELLs are built around the four  essential skills students must acquire: listening, speaking, reading and writing. The instruction is content-based. The content,  materials and lessons are adapted to meet each student’s needs and provide scaffolding for language. The teachers utilize  differentiated teaching methods to ensure the success of each individual student at his or her level. There is a strong emphasis  on literacy work, following a balanced language approach in the workshop model.     Language Arts (ESL, TBE, Dual Language):     In 2013 we adopted the Ready Gen K-5 ELA core curriculum. The curriculum combines the requirements of the NYSED, content  aligned to the CCLS, and strong teacher support into a cohesive program that addresses today's educational priorities. Ready  Gen is organized around units of study that feature thematic text sets. Our students read authentic pieces of literature, such as  novels, trade books and shorter, related texts of multiple genres. They experience close reading of text at varying complexities  across grades, and engage in the task of citing text evidence in response to text-based questions that involve higher-order  thinking.      Through Ready Gen, we continue to provide a Balanced Literacy (The Readers and Writers Workshop) approach to reading.  Students receive various levels of support in large and small groups as well as individually, and move from dependent to  independent readers, writers, listeners, and speakers. Students are provided with guided and shared reading instruction in  order to develop fluency and comprehension.  Accountable talk is utilized to develop the ELLs' language skills. Teachers focus  on the four language modalities with a concentration on academic vocabulary development. They introduce new concepts by  discussing vocabulary words key to that concept. Another strategy is guided practice. With this method teachers structure  lessons so that students work together to understand what they read by listening, speaking, reading and writing  collaboratively about the academic concepts in the text.     In Grades K-5 bilingual classes, literacy is taught in both English and Spanish as per the Language Allocation Policy. The literacy  program includes a period for skill building in English which introduces ELLs to the conventions of grammar, literacy texts, oral  language and vocabulary development in an authentic context. Instructional strategies depend on the study units and the  assessment data. Teachers facilitate direct teaching of vocabulary through listening, speaking, reading, and writing in short- time segments, they assess informally based on curriculum, do fluency building (high frequency words), as well as teach  academic vocabulary using various research-based strategies. Teachers use a variety of interactive strategies to teach  phonemic awareness.     Math (ENL, TBE, Dual Language):     We are currently implementing the Go Math program designed to meet the objectives of the CCLS for Mathematics. Lessons  begin with context-based situations and progress toward abstract problems. Students receive support as they advance from  concrete to abstract content through the use of models and math talk prompts, which is presented throughout the program.  The mathematical content strands are all addressed in Go Math. Each strand is addressed throughout all grade levels of the  program. Each grade level builds on and extends concept understanding so that the students approach each new challenge  from a firmly established foundation. Teachers use explicit vocabulary building and recurrent informal assessments. They  monitor progress through group and individual assessments and portfolios. Concepts are reinforced through games, math  journals, and a variety of tactile strategies.     In Dual Language classes Math is taught in Spanish and English using ENL strategies and native language support. In TBE classes  Math is taught in Spanish. Students in Freestanding ENL programs receive Math instruction in English with scaffolding and  native language support to make content comprehensible.      Social Studies (ENL, TBE, Dual Language):     The Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Social Studies program is used for grades K-5. Students read an array of informational texts.  They learn text structure and unique features of informational text as ways to enhance understanding, master the general   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      academic and domain-specific vocabulary, and master the skills necessary to speak and write about various social studies  subjects knowledgeably. Some of the materials used with ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program are thematic units on  history/social studies from the Rourke Classroom Resources' ELL Interventions Kits (Readers for Writers). In DL and TBE classes,  Social Studies is taught in the native language (Spanish) and English using ENL strategies/native language support.     Science (ENL, TBE, Dual Language):     Grades K-2 use the Harcourt School Publishers, New York City Edition, and Grades 3-5 use the Foss Core Science curriculum.  Science glossaries are provided to ELLs in Grade 4 which are also used during the administration of the NYS Science Test. A  Science cluster teacher provides additional science instruction, including lab work, for grades K-5. Students read a lot of texts  in science. They learn text structure and unique features of scientific text as ways to enhance understanding; master the  general academic and domain-specific vocabulary; and acquire the skills necessary to speak and write about the scientific  subjects knowledgeably. In freestanding ENL, some of the materials used are thematic units/leveled texts from Readers for  Writers (Science) by Rourke Classroom Resources. In DL and TBE classes, Science is taught in the native language (Spanish) and  English using ENL strategies/native language support.     All cluster content areas teachers align their work with the curriculum in each grade. They use various scaffolding techniques  to build academic vocabulary and to make academic content comprehensible. They consult with classroom teachers in order  to give additional support to the students. Also, our teachers analyze student writing work in Teacher Teams. In response to  identified students' needs, the teachers work to develop approaches that would teach the students various writing skills. The  teachers assess the success of their approach in order to determine the next steps. The aim is to strengthen student writing.     In all subject areas, including Social Studies and Science, the following approaches, methods and strategies are used as part of  targeted interventions for all students, including SIFEs, newcomer ELLs, long-term ELLs, ELLs with special needs, and former  ELLs:     - Graphic organizers, such as semantic mapping, story maps, concept maps, KWL  - Realia, art objects, visual displays, illustrations, real life examples, visual cues, kinesthetic (hands-on) activities  - Word walls, strategy charts related to the units of study, the flow of the day charts, charts modeling the correct use of  language, leveled libraries across a variety of genres, including multicultural books and books in Spanish  - Glossaries and dictionaries in the students' native languages  - Vocabulary development component and extra time to practice applying and using the vocabulary  - Cooperative learning, peer tutoring  - Practicing paraphrasing and retelling, picking out the main idea of the text and justifying it through text-based evidence,  relating reading to student experiences, prediction, and visualization of a story (draw a scene, plot, etc.)  - TPR (Total Physical Response) with entering and emerging ELLs to address the listening modality  - Natural Approach methodologies, Cognitive Academic Language Learning, Whole Language Approach  - Individual conferencing with the teacher, think-alouds used with reading, explicit teaching of text structure, chunking and  questioning aloud, retelling a story, daily re-looping of previously learned material, and use of native language support     Some of our bilingual and ENL teachers attended the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) training. Our goal is to  expand this training to other school-based personnel in order to implement this highly structured and effective model in the  classrooms. This will help our ELLs have access to difficult Math, Science, and Social Studies concepts while mastering the  English language simultaneously.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In order to ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language throughout the year, we administer the  following assessments:     - Spanish Language Assessment Battery (Spanish LAB) test to determine language dominance during the initial identification of  ELLs;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      - Evaluación Del Desarrollo De La Lectura (EDL) to determine the students' reading levels/proficiency in Spanish;  - El Examen de Lectura en Español (ELE) to test students’ vocabulary knowledge and ability to understand words in context.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5 (a) SIFE: This academic year we have 6 (six) SIFE students. We place them in an appropriate age range and in the group that  best suits their needs. They are exposed to read-alouds from a variety of genres in order to develop listening skills and expand  vocabulary. Language structures are developed by engaging students in shared reading. Teachers are using interactive writing  and explicit instruction to support those students with their writing skills. They also apply appropriate scaffolding techniques  and use peer buddy and small-group activities so that the SIFEs gradually feel safe to take educational risks.    We are also looking into obtaining licenses for the Imagine Learning and System 44 programs for our SIFEs.     5 (b) Newcomer: We realize that the demands of newly arrived ELLs are different from the ELLs who have been in the country  for more than a year. When those students are grouped together, our teachers employ a variety of scaffolding methods to  ensure differentiation. In the very beginning, the vocabulary range is our strongest focus in the instruction of our newcomer  ELLs. The newcomer ELLs' language instruction centers on teaching of the Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS), so  that they acquire the basics of the language in order to be able to communicate in school setting and be able to express their  needs. While they are acquiring the basics, they are also introduced to the academic English language, or taught Cognitive  Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) through various instructional strategies. This way the students master academic  content while they become proficient in English as subject areas are integrated with language objectives. They learn English as  they study meaningful content. With the Emerging or Transitioning newcomers, the focus usually shifts to sentence syntax and  the grammar rules, as well as reading comprehension and writing/editing. We support these learners in a variety of content  areas, including social studies and mathematics, scaffolding their learning through previewing, explaining concepts and ideas  to peers and teachers, as well as providing students with manipulatives and other hands-on materials.     5 (c) Developing: The ELLs receiving 4-6 years of ENL services are at risk of becoming Long-Terms ELLs. To support those ELLs,  we analyze the students' NYSESLAT scores and other assessment data reflecting areas of weakness, and plan an intervention  which includes the regular minutes mandated by CPR 154, RtI supports, after school programming, and the Title III after-school  program, if available. The students also participate in the NYSESLAT test prep geared towards their deficiencies assessed by  NYSESLAT.     Our goal is to provide the ELLs who are at risk of becoming long-term ELLs and who have scored a Level 1 or 2 on ELA/Math  with intensive literacy development and math interventions through a coordinated effort from support personnel (RtI Reading,  RtI Math, SETSS, and classroom, and ENL teachers) during regular school hours. These students are encouraged to attend the  after-school program (if available) where extra support is given in reading, writing, and math. The goal is for the ELLs receiving  services for 4-6 years to reach proficiency and test out of NYSESLAT and to increase their academic achievement in Language  Arts and Mathematics.       5 (d) Long-Term: Currently we do not have long-term ELLs, but if we did, our plan would have been as follows:    The long-term ELLs are often orally bilingual (they have a high level of proficiency in social English and their native language),  but they have limited literacy skills in their native language and limited academic literacy skills in English. They are usually  transnationals who have moved back and forth between countries and have inconsistent schooling. This results in difficulties  with reading and writing which impact their performance in other content area subjects. Many long-term ELLs are dual- identified with cognitive learning challenges in addition to their language status. It is important to learn more about the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      academic backgrounds of long-term ELLs and base instruction upon an intensive study of their NYSESLAT scores and other  assessment data reflecting opportunity areas for improvement. The goal is to develop a strong foundation in academic  language and content areas by focusing simultaneously on content (Math, Science, and Social Studies) and literacy/language  learning (SIOP model).     5 (e) Former ELLs: Our Former ELLs receive at least 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA (or other content area), and  classroom teachers continue to support them through scaffolding. The students are paired with classmates whose reading and  writing skills in English are strong. We also ensure that the test accommodations are available to former ELLs for up to two  years after passing the NYSESLAT (these students are provided with extended time on all standardized state-wide exams, as  well as the opportunity to take the exam in a separate location). In some cases, glossaries or bilingual dictionaries are used.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teachers have an ongoing dialogue throughout the year to monitor students’ progress.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   For ELLs identified as having special needs, ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure appropriate  instructional strategies and relevant context related texts are used in the ELL classroom to provide access to academic content  areas and accelerate English language development.      ELL teachers review IEP goals, so that they can address students’ needs while incorporating ENL techniques. Students  identified as entering are pulled out in smaller groups. Multi-sensory techniques are used in this setting to address beginning  language skills. When possible, students with special needs are mainstreamed and combined with students from the general  population. Some ELL students also receive SETSS where specific instruction in early reading and phonic skills (Wilson Program)  reinforce English language skills.     For additional instructional strategies/interventions, see the answer to question 3 above.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ELL-SWD students receive the same state-mandated services for English Language Learners as the general education  students.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     See Part A (Programming and Scheduling), answers to questions 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), 6(d), and 7.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new programs are currently forecasted.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No changes are planned at this time.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  In our school all students, including ELLs, follow the same standards-based rigorous curriculum and are afforded full access to  all school programs and activities. One of the examples is the after-school tutoring program which serves mainly our ELL  students by utilizing small-group, targeted instruction. During this time the students are provided with additional support in  the content areas, and specific areas that the students are having difficulties in. In addition, our school has obtained a grant  through our Community School partnership to provide high-quality after-school programming for our students every day from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      2:20-5:30 P.M. This programming includes access to activities related to the arts, sports, academics, and health. All ELLs are  eligible to enroll on a first-come, first-served basis. ELLs are also encouraged to enroll in the SCORES program, which offers  soccer and poetry instruction after school. Students participate in a soccer match each Friday and have a  summative poetry reading at the end of the eight-week term.     We consider it a success when we provide our ELLs with a rich, challenging and supportive educational environment that helps  them become well-rounded learners and develop positive cross-cultural attitudes, behaviors, and skills that will help them  function in a global society.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In our school, we have a computer room with 32 computers and each classroom has a computer and Internet access. Students  have access to the following language development programs: Renaissance Accelerated Reading (English/Spanish),  Renaissance English in a Flash, and Starfall. In addition, teachers use the Discovery Education program and the Brain Pop  program in English and Spanish to support the content areas in both langiages. All our classrooms are equipped with  Smartboards. The library (which is currently being renovated) will have a research center with several computers. This affords  students opportunities to work on research papers with the librarian. The school also has a laptop cart which teachers can  bring into their classrooms.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The Dual Language and Transitional Bilingual Education program models have a native language component (part of the  instruction is conducted in students' native language, i.e., Spanish). For detailed description of how home language support is  delivered in the DL and TBE program models, please see Part V: ELL Programming.     In the monolingual classes, the teachers support the native language of our ELL students through the following  methods/resources:     - Dictionaries and glossaries  - Paraphrase and drawings  - Cognates and other helpful mother-tongue equivalents to facilitate vocabulary development and to make content  comprehensible  - Pre-teaching or checking for understanding of the concepts in the native language if appropriate  - Pairing students who share the same native language but have different levels of English proficiency, especially for newcomer  ELLs  - Books on the language, culture, and history of the countries of the ELL students  - Native language books relating to the topic or theme of a lesson     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    To support age, grade and proficiency levels of the ELL students, we align our materials and instructional resources to meet  their needs. Our goal is to have a constant collaboration between the classes and the ELL programs, so that there is a  consistency of message and content.     We choose books and writing activities based upon age and grade level as well as proficiency. A text that will peak the interest  of a kindergartener will not have the same effect on a 4th Grade student. So we match a 4th Grade beginning ELL with subject  texts that would interest a 9-year-old, while meeting the language needs of the same student by providing easier texts. Our  belief is that text levels can be adapted to suit different ELL proficiency levels while also providing appropriate and important  core curriculum from each grade level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Due to the comprehensive nature of our ELL programs, we always try to be proactive in contacting and informing ELL parents  whose children will be attending P.S. 98M. Our office staff flags those families whose home language is not English, and  supplies them with additional information and support. The Parent Coordinator offers workshops throughout the year to  engage families and support them with strategies to help their children academically. He also holds office hours to meet with  families as needed to tailor support and services on a case-by-case basis. In addition, our school organizes individual and  school-wide orientations for families of ELLs to assist the newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year.  In these meetings, families learn about their program options available in the New York City public school system for ELLs. Our  school counselor is bilingual and works with the families of ELLs as needs arise.    All 5th Grade teachers of ELLs and the parents of 5th Grade ELL students are provided with an orientation by the  Guidance Counselor regarding the middle school process. Two presentations are made available in the English and Spanish  languages. The Guidance Counselor explains the transition from Elementary to Middle school - the application process, the  middle school choice criteria, and the admission process.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    WE do not offer language electives at our school.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   18 (a) We use the self-contained dual language model. ELLs and EP students work together during the  instructional day. We have a 50/50 language allocation for our Dual Language Program. The students are  expected to comprehend, speak, read, and write in both languages upon their completion of a Dual  Language program.     18 (b) At least two (2) subjects from the core content area are taught in the native language at the  beginning levels.     18 (c) K-2: one day English, one day Spanish. 3-5th Grade students work in one-week cycles: half a day in  L1 and half a day in L2 on alternating weeks.     18 (d) Emergent literacy is taught in both languages simultaneously.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In the years 2017-2019, all teachers (both teachers of ELLs and non-ELL teachers) will receive staff development to refine  their instructional and assessment practices. Some of the PDs done in the previous years (such as Questioning, Analyzing  Student Work, and Danielson's Framework) will be revisited.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69            Here's a list of some of the PDs projected for the 2015-2017 school years:     - Identifying Rigor  - Identifying Student Active Involvement  - Close Reading Instruction  - Questioning & Discussion Techniques  - Modeling Techniques  - Establishing a Purpose of a Lesson  - Teaching Points and Tasks  - Assessments / Checking for Understanding  - Characteristics of Lexile Levels  - Differentiation  - Teacher Intervisitations  - Implementation of the ELA and Math curricula (ReadyGen and Go Math) / Lesson Planning  - SIOP Goals Implementation     Our ENL teachers attend various workshops geared towards ELLs throughout the year and share the informaton with the staff.  Here is a sample of just a few of the PDs they have recently attended or plan to attend:     - Using the SIOP Model to Prepare ELLs for College and Careers through CCLS  - Classroom-Based Strategies and Structures that Support the Inclusion of Students with Special Needs (Meeting the Diverse  Needs   of Learners: Responding to the Special Education Reform)  - Building a Strong Tier I: The cornerstone of Effective Reading Instruction for ELLs institute (with Dr. Diane Haager)  - Promoting Critical Thinking in Math and ELA through Questioning to Influence Classroom Practices  - Professional Development on the Six Common Core ELA Shifts     Our Guidance Counselor Heidi Guzman has been involved in the prefessional development sessions on the Middle  School application process, and the Respect for All PDs through our Parents Association.     Our coaches will continue providing group and individual professional development to staff on a needs basis throughout the  year.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In 2017-2019, our school will provide PDs to all teachers and administrators that address the needs of ELLs. At least 15% of the  PD hours for all teachers will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching  strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Bilingual and ENL teachers will receive a minimum of 50%  of the PD hours focused on language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best  practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Also, all the teachers will be  given information on how to provide scaffolding and differentiate instruction for the ELL students, how to work with  newcomers in the classroom, we review NYSESLAT procedures, testing accommodations, discuss strategies for the ELLs with  special needs, etc. Records for PDs are compiled in a binder and stored in the PD binder of the administrator supervising that  training.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In 2017-2019, our school will individually meet with the parents/guardians of ELLs at least once a year (in addition to parent- teacher conferences, initial parents orientations, quarterly progress meetings, or other scheduled meetings), to discuss the  goals of the student's program, the child's language development progress, English proficiency assessment results, and  language development needs in all content areas in English and in the Spanish language in the case the child is enrolled in our  Transitional Bilingual Education program or Dual Language program. The meetings will be conducted with a qualified  interpreter/translator, if needed.  To schedule the meetings, we send home personalized letters inviting parents to annual  individual ELL meeting. If parents cannot attend in person, they can set up a conference call and translation services will be  provided as needed. We will keep phone logs and send follow-up letters in the case of a phone conference, parents will receive  a follow-up letter summarizing the conversation and key goals going forward.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our parents are actively involved in many different activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs, such as,     - Parent Teacher Conferences     - Open Houses - organized by the school administration. Parents have an opportunity to meet with teachers and receive  information about the curriculum and the expectations for the school year     - Ten-week nutrition program - organized to promote healthy eating habits and cooking methods for parents and children     - We have a partnership with the organization Literacy Inc. They provide a program parents which teaches them how to  improve their children's reading and writing skills at home     - Annual ELL Conference - held by SLT in collaboration with PA once a year with the support of the administration and the  teachers who offer workshops and conferences for parents     - Parent Coordinator led workshops for parents - every month the parent coordinator has a workshop for parents.

Some parents of ELLs are part of the PTA.     Throughout the year, teachers keep in close contact with the parents of ELLs, informing them of their children's progress or  any concerns they might have. Parents are encouraged to read to their children in home languages.     All parents are informed about and encouraged to attend meetings, shows, and events held at P.S. 98. In addition, we publish  monthly news letters for parents in English and Spanish, and a monthly calendar which informs parents about all school  activities. The activities are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator, if needed.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    This report includes the data (demographics, program breakdown, State Exams, etc.) only for the students who are currently in our  school (as of June 2017).    As one of the recipients of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers grant, in 2017 our school will become a Community  School. We will partner with various community-based organizations that will provide services focused on expanding learning time,  family engagement, attendance improvement strategies, and health and wellness services for all our students, including the ELLs.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maritza Rodriguez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Shorac Kappock Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 06M098  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The language needs of the parents at P.S. 98M are usually identified during interactions and contact with parents.  We also manually go through the HLIS of all new registrants and check the ATS to determine which new admits  and their parents speak another language. Currently the following languages are represented in our school in  Grades K-5 based on the Home Language Identification Surveys: Arabic, Bengali, Kazakh, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish,  and Urdu. Our school personnel, such as Parent Coordinator, teachers, guidance counselors, school secretary, and  members of the Parent Association are able to translate various documents into Spanish. The documents are then  reviewed by the administration. For all the other languages we use the translation services available through the  NYC DOE.    P.S. 98M has a large population of the English Language Learners. Therefore a large majority of the parent  community requires support in oral and written communication. Informal data are collected to determine written  and oral interpretation needs. All teachers in our school community are constantly being made aware of certain   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      limitations some parents may have regarding language barriers. The Home Language Identification Surveys are  always useful in determining who may need written or oral translations, as well as what languages are needed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The parents' preferred  languages for both written  and oral communication  are as follows (in  alphabetical order): Arabic,  Bengali, English, Kazakh,  Russian, Serbo-Croatian,  Spanish, Urdu.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Important and time-sensitive information  and letters will be give to translators well  in advance of scheduled meetings,  conferences, and workshops to ensure  that materials are available in the  parents' native languages when needed.  Oral interpretation services will be  provided in school by the school staff  (Parent Coordinator, Literacy/Math  Coaches, teachers, parent volunteers,  Principal, and Assistant Principal) who  are fluent in English and Spanish, as well  as the NYC DOE phone translation system  for low-incidence languages. During  formal meetings, a member of the  district personnel will provide  translations for parents.            2.

A copy of the notice informing parents about their rights regarding translations and interpretations services will be  distributed. Parents will also be made aware of these rights during meetings with school staff, i.e., conferences, IEP  meetings, etc.    b. Signs offering translation services and assistance in the parents’ respective languages will be posted in the main  office and by the security desk.    c. The locations of the signs will be stated in the school's safety plan. The safety plan will contains procedures for  ensuring that parents in need of language access services will not prevented from reaching the school's administrative  offices solely due to language barriers.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The feedback from parents on the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services will be assessed  using surveys (which allow parents to specify areas in which they need help), through conversations, and PTA  meetings. We will use the information gathered from the surveys to evaluate whether our translation and  interpretation services address the needs of the parents. We will regularly adjust our procedures and implement new  ones to address parental needs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79
