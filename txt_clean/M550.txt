This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers is a small learning community, located on 250 West 18th Street in New  York City. We serve new immigrant students or students who still require English acquisition in grades 9 through 12.  We are dedicated to educating students of diverse cultural and academic backgrounds, as they make the transition to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      the American educational system. We provide a safe and nurturing environment for students to focus on acquiring  English as an additional language while celebrating student diversity.   We believe in providing high quality instruction in order to prepare students to become College and Career Ready as  well as responsible contributors to a global society. We engage students and families by providing after school classes,  activities, career, academic and personal counseling in an effort to support students reach their highest potential.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Liberty High School was originally established in 1986 as a one-year, ninth grade only, alternative transitional  Bilingual/English as a Second Language (ENL) Program. Under Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Liberty was  transformed into a four year high school with a stand alone ENL program and several bilingual programs: Polish,  Chinese and Spanish. Liberty's first graduation was in 2006. As the bilingual demand decreased, funding for these  programs became a challenge and finding qualified teachers became challenging, Liberty transitioned to a stand alone  ENL program in 2013. This has allowed the school to focus and develop a comprehensive after school program,  Saturday Regents Program and self funding summer program for our students.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Liberty High School is a small transfer school. We have no admission requirements, we only mandate that our  students are new or recently arrived to the country and are English Language Learners. Currently, 26% of our students  are in temporary housing, 42% of our students are over aged and under credited (OAUC), and 16% of our students are  students with interrupted education (SIFE). Each subset requires a different need. The students in temporary housing  need social and emotional support for the issues that led to them losing permanent housing. Liberty's OAUC  population needs credit bearing classes after school and during the summer. The SIFE students need basic literacy  skills. Over the past year and moving forward Liberty continues to assess and adapt our program by adding a health  clinic partnership, additional guidance counselor and a partnership with NYU Social program for an additional  counselor. Liberty continues to offer an after school program for credit two days a week and Liberty added a Literacy  Coach to assist with students and teachers professional growth in this area.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year , Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers made the most progress in the  following areas: College and Career Readiness as it relates to 5A and student enrichment through our Title III Grant  from the Office of ELLs as it relates to 5B. Liberty High School offered three Advanced Placement Courses through our  partnership with the Office of Access and Equity: AP English Language and Composition, AP Spanish Language and  Culture and AP US History. As we continue our work during the 2018-2019 school year, Liberty's focus will continue  around 5A Rigorous Instruction in order to make gains on the School Quality Snapshot College and Career Index. To  that end Liberty will add three more Advanced Placement courses for our students, AP English Literature, AP  Psychology and AP Environmental Science. The school will continue to support the Robotics program and lunch time  peer tutoring program. Students in the tenth and eleventh grades made college visits and took PSAT and SAT during  the regular school day. There has been a marked improvement in SAT Verbal scores as result of the school's focus on  academic vocabulary acquisition. Students identified as "at-risk" were identified for teacher mentoring after school on  every Tuesday. During the 2017-2018 school year, Liberty's Title III Grant was instrumental in creating a supportive  environment (5B) for our students and staff. The funding was used in a variety of ways that benefited our students  throughout grade levels. For example, students were offered morning tutoring writing with several ENL teachers and  Bilingual teachers in Social Studies and Mathematics. The Grant also funded a robust after school program for our  students supporting rigorous instruction (5A). The Science and ENL Departments partnered and offered the students a  course called Discovery and Investigations. The class offered students a hands on approach using experiments for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      inquiry based teaching. The students were offered several ARTS options through the grant. For example, the Grant  was able to continue our partnership with The Kitchen a theater arts production company in Manhattan.    As Liberty continues to focus on 5A the entire staff will work on 5C Teacher Collaboration. This key area of focus will  increase the staff's understanding of the Teacher Framework and norm our understanding of Effective Instruction.  This work will continue through Learning Walks in which all teachers will inter-visit each others classroom once a term  to provide actionable feedback to their colleagues. Learning Walks will also provide progress monitoring for our work  around vertical alignment in our teacher teams that cycle for five weeks, five times a year. Specifically, teacher  collaboration needs to improve in the Mathematics and Science Departments to improve Algebra, Earth Science and  Living Environment scores on NYS Regents exams. ENL teachers can provide actionable feedback to subject  department colleagues to improve their delivery of academic vocabulary and ENL strategies to increase student  outcomes.                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M550   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   427   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We find it imperative that we continue to support all of our teachers through differentiated professional development  opportunities. All teachers set their own professional goal at the beginning of the school year during the initial  planning conference, which was discussed at the prior End of Year Conference with the Principal. The school's’  professional development plan is centered on the needs of the teachers as well as student achievement data and  credit accumulation. The Professional Development Committee in conjunction with the administration set the  calendar of activities for the year. The PD Committee and the Administration have agreed to continue the Data Action  Model and Root Cause Protocol as well as meet monthly during the Other Professional Work Time. Committee  members will take an active role in designing and delivering professional development to their peers when teachers  are not in their Data Action Model Teams. The Data Action Model allows teachers to work in teams which examines  student work and reviews student data from the classroom using a set of protocols. Teachers are given an option  menu and within their team select how they will conduct their five week cycle. Teachers will have an opportunity to  work in five week cycles five times during the 2018-2019 school year. Teachers receive other professional  development workshops when they are not in teams. Topics for sessions are based on Advance Data as well as  additional feedback from teachers through the Professional Development Committee. To assess the value of  professional development sessions teachers are given two separate surveys during the school year: February and  June. Teachers are also given the opportunity to discuss their particular needs at initial planning conferences, mid  year conferences and end of year conferences with the principal. Additionally, Liberty provides job-embedded and  off-site professional development opportunities. Specifically, we look for opportunities through the Office of English  Language Learners and the Office of Equity and Access to support our AP4ALL initiative. We encourage teachers to  attend workshops, classes, and conferences outside the school in order to keep up-to-date with the latest research in  their disciplines. We provide our newer teachers with mentors that make available their experiences and expertise  during school as well as after school. We hold a new teacher meeting once a month to support our new teachers in  their professional growth. Additionally, we support the needs of any teacher that feels he or she would benefit with  the support of a mentor. We also provide our teachers with the support of a Generation Ready coach (formerly  AUSSIE) and instructional support peer inter visitation. Finally, our supervisory team is proactive in providing ongoing  continuous support through the observation process. We will recruit new teachers through our connection with CUNY  and their student teacher program and New York City Teaching Fellows.         2b.

Every Monday, teachers and paraprofessionals meet with their respective departments with a lead facilitator to  examine student data and student work for five weeks. Their conversations are structured around the Notice and  Wonder Protocol, Tuning Protocol, Last Word Protocol and Consultancy Protocol. Teachers use their time in their  professional learning community to look at student work that reflects the instructional shifts of the CCLS and other  curriculum created by the NYC DOE such as the Social Studies and ELA curriculum guides delivered during the 2017- 2018 school year. Team work is also used to vertically align our departments to support our AP4ALL initiative. After  each week, a recorder sends the minutes of the teacher discussion to the administration. The notes are reviewed and  evidence of feedback is observed during the normal cycles of teacher observation. The other time is spent on a  professional development topic relevant to teacher need as demonstrated through the observation process and  Advance Data. Teachers are asked to attend Professional Development workshops offered through the city and  encouraged to attend other workshops during their own personal time that cover CCLS.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The MOSL committee met several times to discuss the assessment choices for Liberty’s ELL population. The local  measure will be the ELA performance assessment grades 9-12, growth model. All teachers will be linked to the  NYSESLAT for their state measure. The committee surveyed the school wide teaching staff before the final decision  was made. Teachers have set department grading policies and are moving towards common assessments for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      midterms and finals. Teachers already use common assessment in the Math and Social Studies Department. All  teachers received a professional development workshop on the importance of using a variety of assessments and  using the data to inform their instruction in September 2017         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5A, 5B, 5C,  5D, 5E        Section 5A, 5B, 5E     Section 5A, 5C, 5E,  5D     Section 5A, 5B, 5C,  5D, 5E      Title I Part A (Basic)   Federal   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Federal   Federal   Title III, Immigrant   Federal   Tax Levy (FSF)   Local   255,373.00      0   52,942.00      0    3,606,995.00      X         X      X      X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers' Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful  assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and  students with disabilities. Our school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness  of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of  the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet  the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Liberty High School , in compliance with Title I, Part A, Section 1118 ESSA, is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children.      Liberty High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Initial and internal testing focuses on evaluating students' level in reading, writing, speaking and listening to place in the  appropriate ENL level during the registration process. Liberty's internal assessment has been created by ENL teachers based on  the benchmarks for each ENL level 1-8 at Liberty High School. A copy of Liberty's ENL/ELA curriculum is given to all teachers  including content based instructors. Once students has taken the test, the assessment is reviewed by an ENL teacher (LAB  BESIS Coordinator, who makes the recommendation for ENL level to the guidance counselor. Once a student has been  programmed there is a two week opportunity to make program adjustments for the student based on their classroom  assessment.  Once students are placed in the correct ENL level, the classroom teacher gives a number of formal and informal  assessments that are graded with a normed rubric to verify if the placement is valid. All classes and assessments use a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      balanced literacy approach that focus on the four skills for ENL students: reading, writing, speaking and listening. This year the  focus will be on writing since 82 students left this portion of the NYSESLAT blank.    Liberty uses their professional development minutes to review student work through our school wide Data Action Model  protocol. We continually use student work to address ENL curriculum needs as well as strengthen our understanding of  language objectives across all subjects and disciplines. The data shows that teachers and students need to focus on disciplinary  literacy in science and math. Both the Living Environment and Algebra Common Core NYS Regents exams were below 40%  passing.  However, students did well on the Common Core English Regents exam with 71% passing. The NYSESLAT results for  2017 indicated only 8 students that regressed and 28 students made no change in their level. 93 students tested at the  transitioning level and 61 students tested at expanding. No students tested at Commanding. Liberty admitted over 100  students eligible to take the NYSESLAT last year and only 18 tested at entering with 99 testing at Emerging.   Liberty is  committed to using the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) for our students with a concentration on language  objectives that have clear function and structure components. Liberty teachers focus on reading and writing in every  classroom as the data continue to shows that students continue to need supports in these areas.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Structures that support this effort:     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Liberty currently assesses the value of its program by the graduation rate which includes the 4 year and 6 year graduation  Cohorts, retention rate, NYS Regents results, Scholarship Report data,  NYSESLAT results and Achieve 3000 summative  assessment results. Through consistent review of student work and analyzing learning gaps versus the instructional gaps  Liberty teachers are constantly rethinking instruction and strengthening learning objectives that maximize how students use  English as well as strengthening their native language skills. Currently, the specified area of need is in math and science with  under 40% passing both Regents exams.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered on NYS Regents exams, scholarship report data, mid term and final exam  assessments the following structures are in place for intervention:     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Liberty encourages teachers to use a three tiered intervention support system for struggling students. Students that are not  meeting ENL benchmarks are identified and are given small group instruction during the week by a certified ENL teacher.  Students that continue to struggle are given a class after school that meets twice a week with a certified ENL teacher. Students  that still struggling are given one to one tutoring during the day during a non academic course such as Art, Music and Physical  Education.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Liberty teachers continually discuss data patterns as part of our school wide Data Action Model protocol used during weekly  Professional Development minutes on Mondays. When teachers meet either by department for 5 weeks or interdisciplinary  for five weeks, the protocol requires an in depth analysis of student assessment data either on state exams or uniformed  department assessments (mid terms and finals). A group of ENL teachers reviewed the current Collections curriculum in  tandem with both the High School Writing Scope and Sequence curriculum and Bi Literacy / ENL standards to target specific  skills and align Liberty's ELA / ENL curriculum to what general education students are exposed to at the high school  level.  Scaffolds and adjustments are made as necessary based on student work and assessments results during the PD time.  This is an ongoing process that is completed during our Professional Development time during department cycles and  interdisciplinary cycles.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         This year's 2017 NYSESLAT results reveal the following information about Liberty's progress: 30% students left the writing  portion of the NYSESLAT blank. 17 tested as Entering, 61 tested as Emerging and 4 tested as Transitioning. Students in the  Entering and Emerging levels receive double period ESL which is 450 minutes a week. Teachers will be asked to focus on  sustained writing prompts and using Achieve 3000 as informational texts to support writing prompts and / or Essential  Questions for students to answer. There will be a school newspaper this year to assist with writing. The newspaper will be  both print and online.  The speaking portion of the NYSESLAT was left blank by 18 students. In order to help students with the  speaking portion of the NYSESLAT students will be offered a Public Speaking class and teachers will be asked to include a class  presentation by students at least once a marking period to assist with this skill. Besides, targeting the students that reverted a  level, there are 54 students that have made no progress with most students at the transitioning level. In order to assist these  students, they will be programmed for enrichment at after school with The Kitchen our theater arts program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Structures to disseminate assessment findings:         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           Liberty High School uses a departmentalized approach to its organization. Since Liberty is a transfer high school  grades 9-12 with most students entering as over aged and under credited (OAUC) Liberty programs students based on  individual needs as well as language proficiency. All content teachers are provided with a copy of the ENL/ELA  curriculum which is aligned to the Collections ELA curriculum, High School Writing Scope and Sequence and Bi Literacy  / ENL Standards. This provides our school with a set of unique benchmarks for each ENL level 1-8. Students receive  integrated instruction through the ELS and ENL classes, as well as receive stand alone ENL minutes  based on their  proficiency level. ENL and ELA classes are programmed based on same proficiency levels. All content teachers use the  SIOP model to plan lessons and use language objectives that address structure and function to increase students'  proficiency of disciplinary literacy and academic content language.  Content classes for Social Studies, Science and  Mathematics are mixed proficiency levels in regards to ENL levels.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Liberty High School has an eight period day with each period meeting five days a week. Each instructional period is 45 minutes.  The organization of our teachers ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the  proficiency levels to each individual student based on the NYSESLAT results. The instructional minutes are explicitly delivered  in the ENL model as per CR Part 154. Our master program is set up that the daily, weekly, monthly and semester minutes are  calculated  to meet the requirement under the law. Our ENL classes are connected to the ELA classes and no credit is awarded  unless the students successfully passes the ENL class. Dependent upon proficiency level ENL classes may be double period. The  ENL is also integrated with the ELA classes.  Students that test on the NYSESLAT as Entering or Emerging typically receive over   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      600 minutes a week when the requirement under CR PART 154 is 360. Students that test at Transitioning or Expanding  typically receive 225 - 400 minutes per week which exceeds the requirement of 180 minutes per week. Our commanding  students receive 180 minutes of weekly instruction. SIFE students receive te mandated minutes as per their proficiency level  and an additional 90 minutes twice a week with an ENL teacher and a Mathematics teacher.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All teachers at Liberty High School are required to use the Sheltered Observation Instructional Protocol (SIOP) model when  delivering instruction to our ENL population.  The protocol requires that teachers write clear language and content objectives  for each lesson. Language Objectives are further delineated to include function and structure. Function determines how the  students will use the new language they acquired during the lesson and structure determines the specific language being  taught. All content is delivered in English with teachers accessing students' native language during small group instruction.  Teachers do this by allowing or providing bilingual glossaries, translators and scaffolds to assist students in processing the  content. When appropriate students are grouped homogeneously by language in order for students to assist each other during  the lesson. Teachers clearly define language objectives in all lessons across the content to identify the structure and function  of their objectives. All teachers are given a copy of the ENL curriculum used throughout the ENL levels 1-8. The curriculum  identifies performance standards at each level.  Content teachers use this information to reinforce the skills and language  structures students are learning in their ENL classes. The ELA curriculum is based on the Collections Curriculum and the Home  Language Arts Standards for ENL. The curriculum ensures students read a mixture of information texts as well as literary  texts as required by the revised standards issued in May 2017. By using the Home Language Arts Progressions, teachers are  able to incorporate a wide variety of anchor standards and focus on the Main Academic Demand as well as the Grade Level  Academic Demand.  Content teachers use this as schema to access language in their own classrooms. Teachers use the following materials in their  classes: Achieve 3000, Discovery, Brain POP, Pearson Algebra, Geometry and Trig textbooks, Macdougal Litel Global, US,  Government and Economic textbooks, non fiction articles, Primary source material, short stories and literature. Content  teachers focus on disciplinary literacy focusing on strategies used by scientists, historians and mathematicians to read sources  and texts particular to them. Teachers received copies of Disciplinary Literacy from the NYC DOE and will continue to receive  professional development in this area to increase their own understanding of the difference from content literacy. Liberty has  a full time literacy coach that created a center for students to work on their individual progress in reading and to in part the  love of reading as required by the changes in May 2017.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The literacy level of all students is evaluated upon their arrival to Liberty High School. During the registration process  students are evaluated for their English ability if any and asked to write in their home language. Teachers  that speak a  students' home language evaluate their writing in order for the staff to provide the best service as soon as a student begins  classes. Once students are programmed teachers have two weeks to evaluate them using pre assessments and Achieve 3000  to determine lexile level. If student was programmed in error, it is corrected through consultation with Guidance Counselor  assigned.  During ELA integrated ENL class and content area classes teachers provide students with home language glossaries,  ipads and computers for software translation when appropriate. Students have access to peers in their content area  classrooms since they are mixed ability in English proficiency to access their home language for schema. Teachers assess their  ability to communicate  in home language with their peers.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. There are 57 SIFE students with 37 in 9th and tenth grades and 23 in the 11th and 12th grades. Students that are new to  Liberty are programmed for the appropriate level ENL class during the day which corresponds to the mandated minutes,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      and Integrated ELA and ENL class. Content classes are delivered in English. Teachers support their academic growth by  differentiating the material via readiness and motivation. Teachers in a double period ENL class are required to use Achieve  3000 this year and content area teachers can access Achieve 3000 for articles and materials that correspond to the  different lexile levels in their classes.  Teachers use the RTI model of identifying students that are struggling creating smaller  groups for more individualized instruction with the literacy coach either via push in or pull out and if needed individual  instruction. SIFE students that are not fluent in their native language and struggle with literacy are given a once a week class  with a teacher that works on basic literacy through a program Liberty purchased. This is a pull out model with an ENL teacher.  Teachers use scaffolding strategies to engage SIFE students and receive additional support in an after school class that meets  twice a week for an additional 90 minutes a week. Students that are identified as SIFE in 11th and 12th grades work with the  Literacy Coach in an after school program that supports the school newspaper. They are also offered the The Kitchen Program  for enrichment after school.  B. Newcomer students are usually placed in a double period ENL class with an integrated ELA /ENL class.  Content classes are  taught in English with native language supports. All placements are made based upon the results of an assessment students  take during their registration process at Liberty. Teachers give an assessment in their individual classes to make sure the  placement is accurate and they have two weeks from the time a student enrolls at Liberty to request a change from the  Guidance Counselor.    C. According to the Data there are 270 developing (0-3 years of service). These students are given a choice of content area  classes to support their growth as learners. We offer several English Electives that meet the differentiated needs of our  students. Students are also encouraged to take different science electives to support their interest and growth as learners.  Students can meet diploma requirements through Living Environment, Earth Science or Chemistry. Teachers differentiate  assignments by allowing choice, visual support, and leveled readings but all assessments are given one rigorous rubric that is  aligned with Common Core Learning Standards and NYS Regents exams.   D.  According to the data only 14 students are considered Long Term ELLs. They are given support through increasing the  number of weekly minutes they receive in ENL instruction. These students are targeted for after school enrichment programs  that work in skills needed for NYS Regents Exams for graduation.   E. At this time Liberty High School has no students that are former ELLs or students that tested at a commanding level on the  NYSESLAT. However, students that are former ELLS, would receive an ENL class targeted at research writing and  public  speaking at the College Level.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Liberty's special education teacher is trained in ENL methodologies and strategies. The Special Education teacher provides  SETTS services to our students with IEPs and any additional students that are recognized to have severe learning issues  identified by the bilingual guidance counselors and still needs a referral for Special Education services. The special education  teacher also pushes into the classroom with Educational paraprofessionals to support students within the classroom.  All  teachers at Liberty use scaffolding and differentiation based on readiness as a strategy to assist ELL-SWDs. Teachers also use  different student group configurations to assist these students. The special education teacher works with the general  education teacher during other professional work time to write a detailed action plan /goal setting sheet for each SETTS  student to achieve language fluency.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are programmed for resource room to meet their IEP mandates and goals. Liberty does not support a self-contained  program, therefore,  students are given any necessary support to be successful in the classroom including the use of a  Educational Paraprofessional. Teachers and Special Education teacher write specific SMART goals for IEP students and meet  during the weekly Other Professional Work Time to case conference about students.  Students that are identified as needing  additional academic intervention services are programmed for after school assistance with a trained ENL teacher.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Liberty offers an after school Academic Intervention Services program during and after the school day. During the school day  teachers tutor students in content area as a professional assignment during student lunch time. Peer tutoring is also available  during lunch time through the Guidance Department. Peer tutoring is matched to student languages.  Teachers and Guidance  Counselors recommend students that would benefit from extra support after school. There are 30 students in the after school  SIFE program: math and ENL both taught in English. Two teachers, one in science and another in social studies provide AIS  after school. These supports are also in English.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, Liberty has been accepted into the AP4ALL program with the Equity and Access Department.  Liberty will offer three Advanced Placement classes next year: Advanced Placement Spanish Language and Culture, Advanced  Placement US History, and Advanced Placement English Language and Composition. Enrichment programs will happen on  Saturdays concurrently with Saturday Regents Prep in the Fall and Spring Semesters for five Saturdays. Students will have an  opportunity to take Robotics after school for credit. Liberty will also offer a Journalism class with the Literacy Coach, The Bell is  the title of the newspaper. It will provide multiple opportunities for the students to increase their literacy skills in English and  Native Language. One section of the newspaper will allow for sstudents to report on events in their respective countries.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Liberty had a bilingual program in Spanish, Chinese, and Polish when it first opened. Over the years, less parents opted in to  these programs during Parental Choice explanation at registration. Family interest decreased, qualified staff retired and  eventually Liberty moved to a stand alone ENL program. As of September 2013, Liberty is a free standing ENL program. If  families choose bilingual program the LAB Besis Coordinator makes a referral within the district.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Liberty High School Academy for Newcomers is unique because our entire student population are English Language Learners.  They all enjoy equal access to all our programs offered during the day and after school. Before the school day students have  access to tutoring in each subject area. After school students have access to homework assistance, enrichment classes in the  content areas and ENL enrichment, and credit bearing classes. Students are offered Saturday Regents prep five Saturdays  before January and June exams.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Liberty High School has invested a great deal in instructional materials for the classroom to support our ELLs. All teachers have  access to Achieve 3000 and receive yearly training. Students have access to glossaries in all subject areas as well as ipads,  laptops and electronic translators to assist with instruction.  All classrooms have been outfitted with Smart Board technology.  Liberty has continued to use Discovery, BrainPop and Pearson Math  online for classroom use. For literacy students Liberty has  purchased Learning A-Z which is used during small group and one to one instruction.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All of the ENL classes include an independent reading project in the students' home language. All the ENL classrooms have  their own libraries as well as our school wide library that has fiction and non fiction books and resources in several high  frequency languages. We also encourage small homogeneous groups during class that allow students to use their home  language to think and process new content material. We encourage parents during our registration process to continue to use  the home language to build native language fluency to assist with better English acquisition.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ENL teachers are given great flexibility to ensure materials are grade appropriate as well as age appropriate. This year the  school has invested in Achieve 3000 to ensure the quality of non fiction texts is leveled for age and language levels. The  assistant principal and principal offer feedback through the observation process on the appropriateness of class materials. The  school has a committee that works on ordering materials for class libraries and school library that are appropriate for our  students. The library has undergone a complete transformation with the help of NYC DOE Library Services. The out dated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         collection has been replaced with age appropriate fiction and non fiction texts in English, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese and  French. The Literacy Coach worked with Follet to create a collection that would help develop the love of reading amongst our  students.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Liberty does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Whenever possible, newly enrolled ELLs at Liberty High School are programmed for summer school. Students take three  courses that are targeted for them ENL, ART and STEM. All teachers that work for the Title III summer program are trained to  use the SIOP model, have received the mandated minutes of professional development targeting ENL instruction. New  students are gathered the first day of school and are given a tour of the building by the assistant principal, the guidance  counselor reviews school policies and expectations, the parent coordinator is introduced and gives a special welcome and  reviews the importance of daily attendance. Liberty hosts a new student mixer during the fall term. When students arrive  during the school year, the parent coordinator introduces new students to a student mentor that speaks the same home  language to assist during the first week of school. The student mentor gives the school tour and introduces the students to  teachers and other students.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Liberty students are granted credit from their foreign transcripts to satisfy their foreign language requirement for the NY state.  We have a small group of students that require a foreign language and Liberty offers Advanced Placement Spanish Language  and Culture.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development Plan   2017-2018     Liberty High School’s professional development plan will continue to address strengthening how teachers look at student work  by department as well as by vertical teams to enforce alignment to the Common Core Learning Standards and to become  Advanced Placement ready. Teachers will meet on Monday afternoons for 80 minutes as per the UFT Contract. There are 32  meeting times and three Chancellor's Conference Days scheduled for the school year. Teachers will continue to look at student  work and assessment data to close the learning and instructional gaps that exist. Three protocols are used during the five week  cycle and teachers revise and pacing calendars and curriculum maps according to their findings during these meetings. The  process is a five week cycle either in departments or vertical teams with professional protocols guiding their discussion.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Vertical teams will have an additional day to present their findings to the school community in order for all disciplines to adjust  curriculum as necessary. All cycles are focused around two guiding questions:  When teachers are not engaged in their cycles, teachers will attend a professional development session designed to target and  strengthen their understanding of the questions above. These sessions will be intermittently between cycles with the following  topics scheduled:     Principal will conduct learning walks with teachers to support academic rigor once a month. Teachers on the learning walks will  use the Tuning Protocol to offer their colleague warm and cool feedback. The observation cycles will be used to monitor the  implementation of the above professional development series as well as continue support of the SIOP model lesson Planning  across departments. The Principal and Assistant Principal will work to ensure that teachers are systematically applying the PD  to improve student learning outcomes.     Liberty's focus will be on strengthening teachers use of the SIOP model and strengthening language objectives both structure  and function. Liberty's instructional focus is reading and writing in every classroom every day.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All our teachers receive professional development that targets ELLs since all of our students are newly arrived immigrants  Liberty's PD only focuses on strategies and activities that strengthen and deepen the teachers' understanding of how to  support ENL students. Liberty teachers attend workshops around the NYC and NYC DOE from the Office of ELLs,  QTEL, and  TESOL organizations. Liberty continues to send teachers to outside workshops through ASCD including virutal workshops that  target ELLs. All agenda and sign in sheets are kept in the Principal's yearly binder for PPO and Quality review purposes.     The school has scheduled the following professional development workshops for teachers of ENLS:  SIOP Lesson Planning a Refresher;September 5, 2017  Scaffolding Disciplinary Literacy for ELLs; September 5, 2017  October 23, 2017; Achieve 3000 refresher training  December 4, 2017; Strategies For Vocabulary Building with ELLs  March 5, 2017; Guided Reading in the Multi Lingual Classroom  April 16, 201; Balanced Literacy and Reading Strategies in Multi Lingual classroom.  April 23, 2017; Differentiation for ENLs  Liberty also uses a Literacy Specialist from Generation Ready to work with teachers by department for five weeks.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents have an individual meeting the a bilingual Guidance Counselor during admissions. to discuss our stand alone ENL  program. All parents are contacted by individual teachers during the school year to discuss individual progress. Liberty's parent  coordinator keeps the master list all parents / students contacted to satisfy CR Part 154. Teachers indicate on an in house form  whether or not they were able to conference with parents or need translation and interpretation services. If parents need  translations services Liberty's Parent Coordinator sets up individual meetings with a translator.  In addition, ENL teachers will  stay an additional afternoon a month and invite their parents to come in and discuss individual progress.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Liberty's Parent Coordinator arranges monthly workshop, meetings and coffee hour with the PTA to engage parents. Liberty  surveys parents needs at the time of registration. The information is kept in a database and a phone master is sent to inform  parents of the monthly workshops. Liberty will continue to provide ENL classes as well as computer literacy classes for parent.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         September 26 2017; Literacy Coach How to Keep lines of Communication Open (focus on school)  October  11, 2017; College Adviser and Application Process  November 8, 2017: Keeping Your Native Language Relevant Workshop  December 6, 2017; Multi Cultural celebration  January 10, 2018; Immigration Coalition  March 7, 2018: Bridge to Dance  April 11, 2017; Spoken Word Presentation by students  May 2, 2018; Celebrating International Child  Teachers meet one to one with Parents throughout the year on Tuesdays during Parent Contact time to discuss the progress of  their child.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rhonda Huegel, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Liberty High School Academy fo                                                                              School DBN: 02M550  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We assess our parents' oral interpretation and written translation needs at the time of admissions which is  ongoing throughout the year. . The Parent Coordinator meets and interviews all families and assesses their needs  individually since Liberty is a diverse global community. The Parent Coordinator has generated a brief parent  profile that allows Liberty to determine our translation needs throughout the year. Additionally, the Lab Besis  Corrdinator (licensed ENL teacher) reviews program options as well as preferred language options on admission  ATS forms. The Pupil Personnel Secretary inputs all details. We use all the information to determine our  translation needs throughout the year for Parent Teacher Conference Night, PTA and SLT meetings, and Open  School Night. The Pupil Personnel Team runs a report to ensure all families have indicated a preference.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Additionally, staff members share information they have gathered through their weekly parental contact time via  SKEDULA and update information on emergency blue cards and ATS records.          2.

In order to ensure the quality of services to parents, Liberty relies on the Learning Environment Survey, parent  responses. We also rely on feedback from the Parent Coordinator and parent profile survey to assess the language  needs of our families. Any survey that is created by the Parent Coordinator to serve the school's needs is translated by  our staff members during their Professional Assignment. Only when necessary the school uses the NYC DOE  Translation Unit.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68
