This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Keeping an Open Mind, P.S. 68X will build our school community by motivating students to develop confidence, while  embracing academic and social opportunities.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 68’s mission is to build our school community by motivating students to develop confidence, while embracing  academic and social opportunities. Our vision is that our students Keep an Open Mind by being determined,  flexible, and always ready to take risks while learning. Our belief is that our students will be successful when the  whole community collaborates to provide a safe and supportive environment; rich in engaging, differentiated  instruction and responsive to the needs of every individual.   P.S. 68 is located in the Wakefield section of the Bronx. Our school population consists of 645 students in Grades  Pre K - 5. Our school is composed of general education classes (12), Integrated Collaborative Classes (7), NEST  classes (10), Self-Contained classes (6). The ethnic composition of P.S. 68 is as follows: Hispanic: 20.%, American  Indian: 1%, Asian: 1%, Black: 76%, White: 1%, Other combined: 1%. Of these students, 1.5% receive ELL services and  about 23% receive Special Education Services. The NEST program services 6% of our students.   Our school offers a wide variety of programs that extend the learning taking place within the classroom and  supports the progress of every child and their different learning styles and interests. We make every attempt to  provide students with academic skills as well as social and academic behaviors that will prepare them to meet the  challenges they will encounter as they continue their education beyond the walls of our school. These include the  following:   ● The PS 68 NEST program has become a magnet for parents seeking an appropriate education for their students  with high functioning autism to be educated with their peers. Our peers in education have made numerous  referrals to friends and family members to attend our school.   ● Education Through Music (ETM): Ensures that all students Pre-K through 5 receive general music instruction. All  classes participate in Winter, Spring, and Holiday concerts. Small group instrumental lessons are available for 4th  and 5th grade students who participate in the String Orchestra. The school Chorus is open to students in Grades 3-5  to perform in concerts.   ● PS 68 continues to be part of the District 11 Instructional Focus Collaboration (IFC). This initiative consists of  grouping 3 schools and form cohorts with similar instructional focus. The emphasis of the IFC is to identify best  practices within our cohort and implement them in our schools. In addition, this collaboration allow us to create  partnerships and conduct inter visitations between the IFC cohort schools.   ● We have a partnership with CKing Education Consulting. The focus of this partnership is to continue to build our  teachers’ pedagogical skills and enhance our schools’ foundation using the mathematical practices. The goal is for  our students to show mastery of mathematical skills during the early childhood grades (K-2). This will maintain and  transfer the necessary skills that the students need in order to obtain academic success in the next coming grades  (3-5) and the transition to middle school.   ● This year our third grade students will join our fourth and fifth grade students in receiving instruction in  departmentalized classrooms, with specialized instruction in ELA (reading & writing) and Mathematics. Each  teacher will teach one subject area. This will permit teachers to have a specialty in said area. Each partnership will  consist of 2 teachers. They will be providing instruction of the selected subject to each other’s homeroom. The 3rd,  4th and 5th grade Nest classes are also included in the Departmentalization. The ICT classes in 3rd and 4th grade  are not part of the departmentaIization due to a decline in registers. However, the 5th grade ICT is part of the  Departmentalization program.    ● For the past 2 years, PS 68x has been exposed to the Kagan Structures. These instructional strategies are designed  to promote cooperation and communication in the classroom, boost students' confidence and retain their interest  in classroom interaction. Our expectation is for our students become familiar with various structures and use them  as a vehicle of learning.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      ● Academic Celebrations: Parents attend celebrations scheduled throughout the school year according to the units  of study; students celebrate their writing pieces, response to literacy or demonstrate problem solving skills as the  culminating activities of each unit.   ● P.S. 68 has an ongoing partnership with COMPASS, an after-school program providing students opportunities to  participate in sports, civic engagement, healthy living, project based learning. In addition, it supports the arts  (music & dance) and other clubs.    Our after-school program will serve as an intervention to work with students in grades 2 – 5 who are performing at  a level 1 and level 2. The goal is to work towards closing the academic gap in ELA and Math. Each academic  intervention group will have a certified teacher to provide small group instruction and reinforce academic skills.   This year we are launching our Homework Clinic: Parents and student working together to promote understanding  of the common core standards. One certified teacher will work with parents whose children are in kindergarten  thru second grade to ensure parents are familiar with the concepts that are being taught in our classroom daily.  Also, another teacher will be selected to work with the parents of students who are in grades three thru five to  provide the same service.    Immigrant After-school Program will provide additional help to the families which English is not their first language.  It allows parents and students to be familiarized with language websites and basic communication skills in English.    To ensure we meet the diverse needs of our community members, we collaborate with several community based  organizations, including: Phipps, Education Through Music, and NYU who support the NEST program.     P.S. 68 continues to show growth as measured by New York State ELA and Math Exams. We currently showed an  increase of grades 3-5 students achieving proficiency. Our growth was 11% in ELA and 12% in Math. P.S. 68 is  recognized as a school in Good Standing for the 2017-2018 school year.               3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school has a significant number of students comprising our special student population. We have several  programs that help address the students’ specific needs according to their individualized education plan. We  currently have the following classes: Self-contained, Integrated Co-Teaching, Nest Program and SETTS program. For  example, our nest program provides students with social emotional support. Our IEP teacher provides an intensive  intervention program with students who are more than 2 grades behind. Approximately 148 of our students have  IEP’s and 1% is identified as English Language learners.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Last year our school had a high number of incidents ranging from levels 1 to level 5 as  evidenced of OORS system. We took several important steps to address this element including a SAVE teacher and  room, two section lunch periods, direct supervision to individual classes by school aides, hallway patrol and  participation from the direct supervisors and guidance counselors.      Key Area of Focus:   As noted during our Quality Review the effectiveness of teacher teams as well as the ability to utilize data to improve  instruction is the key component in moving our students. In response to this need we currently have a team of  teachers who were accepted to the NYC Teacher Leadership Program for September 2015. At the conclusion of the  program the team will have learned and practiced using a variety of facilitation protocols for effective goal-setting,  problem-solving, and reflective practices related to teacher and student work. They will be active leaders in our  school to support teacher teams. Our goal is to use the knowledge and skills achieved through teacher teams and  inquiry work to support our growth in Goal 5A; increase the number of early childhood students who have mastered  “reading habits” to make them lifelong readers and support them as they move through the grades as well as increase  the number of upper grade students that can read on or above grade level.      Accomplishments:      Area of Greatest Growth :   Our greatest growth this year is in the structures that have been established to improve and support the instructional  core (1.1, 1.2 and 2.2). We have implemented a variety of systems specifically designed to provide meaningful  opportunities for professionals to share their expertise and knowledge as a means to improve academic outcomes for  all students. We started a professional learning culture for teachers to share their best practices on how students  learn best. In addition, teachers began to conduct intervisitations among themselves to obtain ideas that will help  improve areas of needs. Professional development has been customized to address most of the Advance components  to increase the rating score. In addition, some professional developments have been created based on teachers’  choice.      Our School Based Improvement Team thrived this year and was responsible for significant changes in school tone and  focus. In addition, we created Vertical Teams for Math and ELA comprised of representatives from each grade level  and sub groups (ELL teacher and IEP teacher) whose role it was to provide communication between their respective  teams, their colleagues and administration. Teacher teams have established protocols and agendas. Distributive  leadership is the cornerstone practice of these meetings involving all members of the team rotating roles. Critical  decisions relating to instruction are an essential function of these teams.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X068   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   681   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  Resources:   Within our school community we have promoted P.B.I.S which teaches and supports positive behaviors throughout  the school building by allowing students to become familiar with expectations of appropriate behaviors. P.S 68  recently altered our theme to “A Sail Matrix” which will have students focus on being safe, attentive, in control and to  lead with responsibility. Areas that will be targeted include the (classroom, hallway, stairwell, bathroom, schoolyard,  cafeteria and auditorium). P.S 68 has positive behavior reinforcement incentives in place within classrooms and  throughout the school community. Due to data feedback from OORS, SWIS, teacher surveys, and the benchmark of  quality we have been able to target strengths and weaknesses within our P.B.I.S model allowing us to make system  changes accordingly. To achieve accurate data tracking, and monitoring of our goals we have a full team of trained  staff i.e (School Counselors, Social worker, School Psychologists, S.A.V.E room teacher, and Assistant Principals) who  are all trained in therapeutic De-Escalation/ Crisis Intervention support systems.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.

However, there remains a  significant number of teachers who are rated Developing which may negatively impact student outcomes.   Strengths:     As noted in the Quality Review, PPO and through MOTP observations it is apparent that teachers are   implementing a wide array of engaging, differentiated, rigorous, and data driven activities. Teachers also  implement strategic grouping structures to address the learning needs of students. For example:     Teachers are collaborating throughout the years by scheduling professional development and teacher team   meetings as well as lunch and learns.     Teachers collaborate based on the Danielson observation feedback to focus on effective best practices.    Teachers are provided with opportunities to participate in professional learning that is aligned to their   grade inquiry work.     Teacher teams were created at each grade level where teachers collaborate and share roles and   responsibilities. Decisions relating to instruction and student performance are essential to the functioning  of the grade teams.   Needs:   Specific areas of challenge for individual and groups of teachers need to be identified through analysis of MOTP  observation data, especially teachers rated Developing or Ineffective. Targeted and differentiated PD needs to be  provided to support the growth of all teachers in the following components: Questioning & Discussion (3b),   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24      Student Engagement (3c) and Formative Assessment (3d).     Teachers need to encourage more student to student conversation throughout the lesson.     Teachers need to encourage students to build upon one another’s responses and initiate discussions.    Teachers also need to hold students accountable for justifying their thinking and formulating their own   questions.     Teachers need to help students develop the skills to self assess and monitor their own progress.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Strengths:   P.S. 68X continued its trend of improvement over the past three years, as there was an increase in the number of  proficient students in ELA and Math from the 2016-2017 school year to the 2017-2018 school year.   Needs:   P.S. 68 services a fairly high student population with IEPs (30%). About 80% of our students were born outside the  US or first generation immigrants. Over 95% students are entitled to free or reduced lunch. Therefore most of the  families are living below the poverty level. We believe all students are able to learn and should have access to high  quality rigorous instruction that prepares them for college and career readiness. In order to continue this growth,  we are preparing our staff to support our students social and academic progress, fostering a culture of high  expectations for all members of the school community.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          29           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS68, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support  of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team,  Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 68 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;     parent Involvement       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 68 X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded  by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share  responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the Fountas & Pinnell MOSL for beginning and end of year performance (running records) and the use of a  literacy profile packet to assess letter ID, sounds and sight words in September, January and May/June. We also, assess using  TC running records between administrations of F&P to progress monitor. We administer writing assessments (pre & post) for  every unit using units of study in opinion, informational and narrative writing to teach writing. The curriculum provides specific  strategies/suggestions to differentiate subgroups (ELLS, SWD,etc). The data provides insights with regard to specific areas of  strengths and weaknesses. This is used to group students and differentiate instruction in both reading and writing.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teacher conducts monthly modality assessments (similar to NYSESLAT). Administration provides coverage to allow for  quarterly assessment scheduled by the coaches for the classroom teachers .     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The AYP calculation is not available at this time. Quarterly writing assessments, end of unit assessments.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students who performed below level on assessments are prescribed an intervention. In conjunction with ENL and/or Setts  teacher, teaching stations and/or mini lessons are created to reteach material.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data from our baseline assessments to determine the level of target intervention a child may need if any.  Strong core instruction is given to ELL students using of ELL methodologies (visuals, vocabulary, native language support). If  students demonstrate more needs, students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 for more targeted and intensive academic support in  literacy and math - in the classroom (math only) and in separate settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT (NYSITELL for new students), ELA , Math and F&P levels are used to plan our ELL programs.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data is a compiled on a excel spreadsheet and disseminated to each teacher and shared on Google docs. Programs are  adjusted to address the areas of weakness for students who need more support and provide enrichment activities for those  students who need excel.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Entering to Emerging students receive 360 minutes of instruction per week- 180 minutes of standalone ENL in  literacyand language development and 180 minutes of integrated ENL in the content areas. Tranisitioning to  Expandingstudents receive 180 minutes of instruction per week- 90 minutes of standalone ENL in literacy and  languagedevelopment and 90 minutes of integrated ENL in the content areas. Commanding students receive 90  minutes ofENL instruction per week for 2 years after reaching proficiency. Students are grouped heterogeneously  (mixedproficiency, same grade) during integrated teaching and (same proficiency, mixed grades) during standalone  ENL.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      ENL: Instruction, whenever possible is scheduled in 2 period blocks. Beginning/intermediate ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL &  integrated instruction (8 periods), and 2 periods of HLA per week. Transitioning/Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL &  integrated instruction (4 periods), and 2 periods of HLA per week. Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL &  Integrated instruction(2 periods) .     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Academic content is delivered in English with some native language support in integrated ENL. Instruction is delivered via  whole group then in small group or one on one depending on need using some of the following strategies to make the content  more comprehensible:  building prior knowledge, vocabulary building, use of visual aids, use of manipulatives and targeted  instruction in areas of weakness based on data. The ENL and classroom teacher use multiple modalities to deliver content via  the Common Core Learning Standards during the blocks designated for reading, math and the content area. Currently we do  not have a TBE or DL program.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Our school ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year by giving them  the  opportunity to be assessed in their native language during classroom exams (where appropriate), MOSL,  and state exams  (math, science).  In addition students are allowed to use bilingual dictionaries on all assessments.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    All ELLs are tought by an ENL teacher (standalone ENL) and co-integrated teaching; have equal access to all academic programs  before, during and after school as well as Saturday programs; are invited to join one of several arts clubs to develop social skills  and language (i.e. enrichment, drama club, chess club).Also, the strategies we use for newcomers and SIFE can apply to both  subgroups. a) SIFE students will receive academic intervention services (AIS) and/or RTI to develop their oral language and  literacy skills and in other areas in which they have deficiencies (math). The guidance counselors assist the SIFE students in  transitioning into the school community and classroom setting as well as understanding the role of “student” (wearing  uniforms, homework, etc.). b) Newcomers are given direct instruction in a small group of their peers during the school day and  extended day program. The ENL teacher provides the classroom teachers with training (sheltered instruction) and ENL  resources such as picture dictionaries, and guided reading specifically designed for ELLs. We also try to assign a ‘buddy’ to our  newcomers within the first week -a responsible classmate who usually speaks the same native language. In addition,  newcomers attend our extended day program (taught by a certified ENL teacher) where they receive scaffolded instruction in  math and literacy (and preparation for upcoming exams for those students in a testing grade) c) For our 4-6 year ELLs, the  results of the NYSESLAT are analyzed to determine area of weakness, instruction is planned accordingly and additional support  is provided. A parent meeting will be held to discuss the results of the NYSESLAT and ways parents can use this annual exam  and other tools and techniques at home to help their child become English proficient. An analysis of this year’s data shows a  weakness in the area of writing. These students will receive targeted writing instruction along with AIS in ELA. In addition, they  will attend after school programs to develop writing skills. d) RTI Long term ELLs will be assigned an academic intervention  services(AIS) specialist to assist the ENL and classroom teacher in assisting the students in developing their English oral skills  and in other areas in which they have deficiencies. A parent meeting will also be held to discuss ways parents can help their  child at home become English proficient using things at their disposal such as the internet and TV language programs. e.  Proficient ELLs meet with the ENL teacher periodically to evaluate progress during their transitional phase. They also receive  the same testing accommodations as entitled ELLs for two consecutive years after their test out  year.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Special education ELLs are served as per their IEP. These students are placed in special education classes, collaborative team  teaching classes or mainstream classes with SETTS. These settings consist of small group instruction with an emphasis on  multiple modalities for delivering instruction. Speech teachers conduct Social club in which an ELL-SWD can learn how t  interact with other students and/or adjust to their new school or changing school environment. The teachers use sheltered  instruction with a heavy emphasis on scaffolding to make input comprehensible for these students.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Academic decisions are made based on IEPs,data from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and other formative and informative  assessments. With regard to instruction we provide nest/inclusion programs which are in a less restrictive environment, push- in model for RTI and ENL & ENL co integrated services. In addition, we mainstream students whenever appropriate.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer after school and Saturday remediation programs.  RTI/AIS in our freestanding ENL program is delivered in English.  Newcomers: Based on formative data collected by classroom teacher student’s weakness are identified and individualized  programs for intervention are developed by the ENL/Classroom/AIS teachers. SIFE: Students will be assigned an academic  intervention services (AIS) specialist or receive RTI services if needed to assist the ENL and co-teacher in developing students’  English language oral skills and in other areas in which they have deficiencies. The guidance counselors assist the SIFE student’s  transition into the school community and classroom setting as well as the understanding the role of “student” (wearing  uniforms, homework, etc.). Long Term ELLs: Students will be assigned an academic intervention services (AIS) specialist to  assist the ENL and classroom teacher in assisting the students in developing their English language oral skills and in other areas  in which they have deficiencies. A parent meeting will also be held to discuss ways parents can help their child at home  become English proficient using things at their disposal such as the Internet and TV language programs. In addition, students  struggling in ELA and/or Math are serviced by the Title 1 Literacy and Math teachers/coaches in small groups.  Content area  teachers work with classroom teachers to devise a plan to assist ELLs struggling in content areas.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, ENL services will be provided as part of Co-Integrated teaching within departmentalization in  addition to pull out and push in instruction. Supplemental programs we are considering are: Max Scholar, iReady, Imagine  Learning     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs have equal access to all academic and non-academic programs before, during and after school as well as Saturday  programs. Some of the programs available consist of the Phipps program (homework help), ETM music program, Saturday  academy, basketball and the P.S. 68 Choir. After school program for newcomers, SIFE and students new to the country vary  based on interest (ie. drama club, arts club, chess club).     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to instruct ELLs include the following but are not limited to: Literacy -Words Their Way (all levels),  Ready Gen, Go Math; Technology- Starfall, Aplus math, 4aesl.org and a formal technology curriculum. The use of an ELMO is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      used as a visual aid to display documents, pictures etc. on a large scale, centeo remotes to that allow Ells with very little  second language vocabulary to actively participate in class activities.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   To provide native language support within our program, students have access to some bilingual materials in literacy and math  as well as the content areas. Students are also encouraged to bring in materials that reflect their native culture (books,  pictures, etc.) to share and discuss with their class.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required support services and resources for ELLs are provided based on a student’s grade level and ability. In the event of a  student not being age appropriate for their grade due to being held over, support for that child’s specific needs are given (i.e.  AIS, RTI, academic programs provided by the school). All programs used for our ELLs are appropriate for elementary level  students and various levels of ability (i.e. 5th grade students use 5th grade resources with support if needed). For example, the  Words Their Way program helps students develop vocabulary through word study and is leveled by language levels/grade. The  Ell periodic assessment is used to assess student projected performance on the spring NYSESLAT is leveled by grades. In  addition, the READY GEN program is appropriate for elementary students across all grade levels and helps students develop  literacy skills      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used to instruct ELLs include the following but are not limited to: Literacy -Words Their Way (all levels),  Ready Gen, Go Math; Technology- Starfall, Aplus math, 4aesl.org and a formal technology curriculum. The use of an ELMO is  used as a visual aid to display documents, pictures etc. on a large scale, centeo remotes to that allow Ells with very little  second language vocabulary to actively participate in class activities.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   School administrators are available throughout the school year. During designated times in the summer, they are available to  assist parents with the registration process. They address any questions or concerns an ELL parent may have. In the event that  they are not able to address the parents' concerns administrators can contact their district liaison.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    NA      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is ongoing at PS 68 with 15% total hours ELL-specific PD for all teachers and 50% total hours ELL- specific PD for ENL/ESL teachers.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Aidimaris Soler, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To determine the preferred language of the parent community for both written and oral communication, parent  language preference from the HLIS, Emergency Contact, and parent surveys are uploaded into ATS. The RAPL,  (which reports parent language preference oral & written) of each parent is used to disseminate information and  services in the parents preferred language. In the event that parent preferred language changes, the information  is reported to the parent coordinator or pupil secretary and uploaded in ATS via the UPPG or PARU screen.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral             Language    Parents preferred language  for written and oral  communication in order of  preference: English,  Spanish.
