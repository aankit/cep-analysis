The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of our school is to prepare students for college and career opportunities. Special projects and courses  promote the theme of environmental sustainability. Students are expected to graduate with the analytical skills  needed to succeed in college and career and the passion to pursue their own scholarly interests after high school.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Rockaway Park High School for Environmental Sustainability has 327 students in grades 9 through 12. The school's  ethnic breakdown is 42.69% black, 33.73% Hispanic, 13.43% White, and 3.88% Asian students. The student body  includes 8% English Language Learners and 25% special education students. Fifty-nine percent of the school is male  and 41% is female.   Historically, Beach Channel High School suffered from poor attendance, low levels of academic achievement and  significant safety issues. After years of poor performance, the Department of Education began the phase-out of the  school in 2010 and replaced it with smaller schools, one of which is Rockaway Park High School for Environmental  Sustainability.   Rockaway Park High School was severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy, with the after-affects still felt today through  student displacement and economic hardship. Seven of the 43 deaths from Hurricane Sandy occurred on the  Rockaway peninsula, the second largest concentration of deaths after Staten Island. The school building was closed  and the schools within were disbursed throughout Queens for four months while the devastated building was cleaned  and repaired.    Sixty-three percent of our students are economically disadvantaged and qualify for Title 1 services. They live in the  surrounding housing projects and small bungalows, (former summer cottages) that are densely packed on the  peninsula. The area is notable for its lack of resources, for example, few after-school programs, no bookstores, one  small public library, no movie theaters or arts venues, one YMCA, and limited grocery and restaurant options. There  are no nearby transfer schools, and bilingual and ESL programs are inaccessible to students. Overcrowding and limited  choices at the elementary and middle school level mean that most students attend their zoned school. The  neighboring elementary and middle schools are challenged to serve diverse students with few resources.    Rockaway Park High School has many structures in place to create a supportive environment and build strong family- communities ties. We use these myriad structures to support our struggling and at-risk students. The school offers  after-school Regents preparation courses throughout the year to provide targeted and intense instruction in the  courses aligned with and culminating in New York State Regents exams. Saturday classes for Regents prep are also  offered in the Spring. Students have many opportunities to make up credits through our targeted Credit Recovery  Program and may repeat courses using the online program GradPoint. Each of the core subjects offer two ICT sections  to accommodate the special education population. Incoming students take 10 periods of math a week to bolster weak  skills. Students who have failed the Algebra Regents also get double periods of math. Students also attend the College  Now program in the building. We have two guidance counselors who closely track and monitor our four grade  cohorts, provide counseling, and support progress toward graduation. Eighty-nine percent of our graduating seniors  applied to college and 100% were accepted, 80% of those students went on to matriculate at over 26 different  colleges including St John's University, Wells College, Buffalo State College, Delaware State, SUNY Farmingdale and  Hunter College.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      3.

Our Special Education population is currently served by five special ed teachers, with each teacher associated  primarily with a specific department (except for one teacher, who has a variety of courses, the other four teachers are  each with the core departments). We provide ICT classes across the grades and throughout the subjects. Almost all of  our classes have at least one section of ICT.    We have an ENL population of 15 students: 6 Spanish speaking, 6 Arabic speaking, 2 Russian speaking, and 1 Urdu  speaking. Currently those students require a part-time ENL teacher (four days a week) who does push-in as well as  pull out.    We currently have two students in temporary housing. Their status is monitored by the Pupil Personnel secretary and  the guidance team. We ensure that those students receive the free clothing they are eligible for and provide  counseling services and support. Those students' teachers are notified--privately and confidentially--that these  students may require additional supports.    Eighty percent of our incoming 9th graders scored a 2 or below on their state Math exam. All of our incoming 9th  grade students receive a double period of Global History this year to support their preparation for the new, more  rigorous Global History exam.    We have instituted a Mathematics pathways this year, allowing our students to participate in Algebra Trig as early as  10th grade, and culminating in AP math courses, physics, or statistics.    72% of our incoming 9th graders scored a 2 or below on their state ELA exam. Ninth grade students will be taking an  independent reading unit their first and second semesters that focuses on literacy skills, reading stamina and  endurance, reading independence, and fluency.   Our graduation rate this year was 72%, (holding steady from last year, and up 10% from the year before,, and up 20%  from the year before that), our college admission rate is 100%, and our college readiness index is ____.   Closer examination of our data indicates that credit accumulation from freshman to senior year declines by an  average of 3-4% each year on average. We are establishing stronger infrastructures to address this issue, for example,  instituting 9th grade advisory, utilizing the College Access for All supports, and creating stronger credit tracking  methods beginning in 9th grade and carried out by guidance in professional development sessions and push-ins to  advisory meetings to analyze the data after each marking period.    The average attendance is 82%.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As noted in the most recent Principal Performance Review there have been numerous areas of celebration for the  school. The Principal uses resources strategically to support the school’s instructional goals and support teachers in  creating meaningful student work products. For example, we have a professional development committee that meets  weekly with representatives from each department. The committee is responsible for scheduling and running  professional development throughout the year and uses multiple data points, such as the Quality Review feedback,  the Principal’s Performance Review feedback, and the state review feedback to set priorities. In addition, we added a       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      dean position last year and incident rates are down 15% as a result. The Principal maximized resources to hire an  instructional coach to support the instructional goals of the school and ultimately improve the graduation rate. The  school graduation rate has increased by 10% in the last three years, climbing from 53% to 72% in just two years.  Additionally, our attendance rate is up by 3%.   One recent Framework for Great Schools area of growth has been Rigorous Instruction: We have been developing  two structures to support rigor in the classrooms. 1. We are implementing Quarterly Assessments in each content  area and are analyzing the data in those areas. We are presenting data to grade teams and departments using a  protocol, planning cycles of re-teaching, and posting the results in our classrooms. 2. The teachers have adopted a  definition of rigor and are developing performance tasks that are aligned with that definition: Rigor is "engaging in  cognitively complex tasks that promote student agency and rigorous discussion." We are asking teachers to develop  quantitative rubrics for those performance tasks and and twice a year use a performance task as a culminating  assessment to take the place of the Regents-aligned quarterly assessment and quantitatively analyze that  performance task. In addition, we will use protocols to analyze the student work products that result to student  measure growth and assess students' strengths and weaknesses.    In addition, in support of rigorous and rich instruction for all, Rockaway Park High School has joined AP for All and will  be offering six Advanced Placement courses that students may register for beginning during their sophomore year in  high school: AP English Literature and Composition, AP United States History, AP Pyschology, AP Computer Science,  AP Environmental Science, and AP Language and Composition.. As well, students will have the option to register for  AP classes in the two other schools in the building.   We have also become a part of the College Access for All initiative and will be focusing on two goals as a result of our  work in the CAfA summer institute: Strengthening our advisory program, and strengthening our Quarterly Assessment  practices. We believe that advisory can be a conduit for multiple student supports, e.g., credit accumulation analysis,  college and career exploration, college visits, alumni guest speakers, application tracking, career shadowing field trips  and career guest speakers, study skills, academic planning and goal setting, emotional and social readiness for college  and career, restorative justice practices, etc. To support college readiness, we believe that, using the Quarterly  Assessment structures already in place, that strengthening that practice will allow teachers to use data to improve  their practice and strengthen students' academic success.    Overall, we have a variety of academic supports for students. Students who achieve in algebra and geometry can go  on to algebra-trig, physics, or statistics. Many electives are available in the music department which include:  Introduction to Music, Guitar 1, and Guitar 2, and an after-school band class. We are also instituting a CTE track that  includes a 9th grade, ninth-period boat building class.    This year's instructional focus is on using questioning and discussion strategies in the classroom that promote rigorous  and meaningful lessons. Teachers are collaborating to revise lesson plans and plan performance tasks that  incorporate these strategies. Teachers are analyzing student work that results from these lesson plans and  performance tasks in order to improve student achievement for the next marking period. We also conduct quarterly  assessments and analyze the data to set instructional goals.   Finally, we plan on growing in the element of Strong Family and Community Ties. In light of that, we are participating  in several new initiatives in the 2018-2019 school year that further the strategic use of our resources:     We are participating in the building-wide development of a family welcome center    We are participating in the building-wide sharing of AP classes and are a member of the AP for All initiative    We have won a CTE grant to develop our carpentry program into a certified CTE program    We are part of the College Access for All initiative and will be using our resources to support study skills in  ninth grade, college trips across grades, and are bringing on a college guidance counselor and the Enroll NY  software and curriculum materials to use in each grade.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13        We are beginning a 9th grade and 11th grade College and Career Readiness class to support students' college   readiness.      We have used and continue to use a teacher peer inter-visitation process that include classroom   demonstrations by teachers and administrators to demonstrate specific strategies.     We are implementing a 12th to 9th grade buddy program again this year.    We have used and will continue to use our Quarterly Assessments to access data about student progress.    We have used and will expand our use of Skedula, Pupil Path and the Graduation Progress Tracker tool to   track student credit accumulation, regents pass rates, absence rates, cutting, and grade point averages.     We making connections with St Francis College, SUNY Albany, and SUNY Maritime and Kingsborough   Community College's maritime program in order to establish opportunities for our students to take college  level classes or participate in internships.     We are hiring a college counselor intern to support our college application process.    We are have purchased the Enroll NY software to support the tracking of senior progress toward college   enrollment, and to track enrollment and continuation data as well.    Much of this work also overlaps with the Framework element of: Supportive Environment.                      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q324   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   303   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Integrate multiple sources of information presented in  diverse media or formats (e.g., visually, quantitatively,  orally) evaluating the credibility and accuracy of each  source.        Evaluate a speaker's point of view, reasoning, and use of   evidence and rhetoric, identifying any fallacious reasoning  or exaggerated or distorted evidence.     PD learning cycles will use models of discussion protocols  presented by teachers who use them well. Colleagues will  use a protocol to analyze the lessons, then incorporate the  discussion protocols in their own practice and subsequently  videotape their lesson for presentation to colleagues to  observe and critique.  In PD Committee, teachers will create a rubric for  questioning and discussion protocols across disciplines          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           20   September  2018  through  June 2019   Admin, PD  Committee, Grade  Team facilitators,  Math Consultant        Teachers will use the Tuning Protocol to analyze their   colleagues questioning and discussion lessons, focusing on  the design and rigor of student tasks involving questioning  and discussion, especially looking at how to modify  questions and discussions for ENL and SpEd subgroups.  Teachers will modify lessons as a result of feedback.   In 2018-2019 we plan to develop our use of data driven instruction  to incorporate the following to support our instructional focus:   Teachers,  students     Teachers will incorporate the use of data to support their   development of rigorous questioning and discussion  strategies by the following methods:     Teachers will use data from the June Regents to analyze   student results, identify deficiencies--disaggregated by sub- groups--and create action plans to address re-teaching of  content that incorporate questioning and discussion  strategies.     Teachers will use their Inquiry Team time to analyze the  results of the Quarterly Assessments and develop action  plans to address deficiencies in the data that incorporate  one questioning or discussion strategy to assess for  effectiveness. Mid-point and final assessments following the  Quarterly Assessment will demonstrate whether the  strategy chosen was effective.     Teachers will triangulate data between the June Regents   data, the Quarterly Assessment Data, the MOSL NYC  Performance Task, and the January Regents data to look for  patterns and assess deficiencies, disaggregating for  subgroups, and creating action plans to address the  deficiencies through Questioning and Discussion strategies.     Teachers will incorporate information form this data into   their curriculum maps and unit plans and specifically  address which strategies they will be using for each  grouping of students: Gen Ed, SpEd, and ELLs.     Admin will review action plans and look for evidence of data      analysis in classroom environments, lesson plans, and  student work products.

Strengths- Based on the NYC School Quality Survey from 2017 we have built strong relationships between our  staff and parents. The students trust their teachers and generally feel comfortable at school. In addition, based  on data from OORS and SOHO, the number of level 3, 4, 5 incidents and suspensions for these incidents were  down considerably for the 4th straight year. During the 2017-18 school year the number of high level incidents  was down 8.5% and the number of suspensions during that same time frame was down 14.3%.    2.  Needs- During this same school year, school-wide attendance remained stagnant at just under 82%. Although  we implemented an incentive program to get students to come to school, we had a difficult time reaching kids  who attended between 25-50% of the time. We need to continue to prepare all students for post-secondary  success. In addition, based on the same survey, we have a need to train teachers to better support at-risk  students.

Teachers take the time to critically examine the curriculum to determine whether it meets the  interests and levels of all groups and they incorporate IEP recommendations for their students. Teachers would like to  further develop their collaborative environment. They want to work on developing their students’ self-management  skills. Teachers would like PD to be sustained and coherently focused and include time to think about, try, and evaluate  new ideas. Teachers would like to take risks to make the school better and become more comfortable with trying new  ideas.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Rockaway Park High School for Environmental Sustainability, in compliance  with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.            Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Rockaway Park High School for Environmental Sustainability will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including  parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation  of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title Is Title I program. This information will be maintained by  the school.     In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed  Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for   additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:                     actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program  as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent  Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree upon the use of  these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents to effectively support their child’s  learning.   engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the  school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in  the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association  (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing  professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;      maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent  Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children  who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent  Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central  office.;               conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability grade-level  curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build  parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system,  student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment  Survey Report;   host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of children  participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and  the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening,  to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to  provide suggestions;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56               translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that  address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Rockaway Park High School for Environmental Sustainability, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and  support of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in  activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and  students will share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent  partnership will be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1 .Our school uses the NYESLAT and NYSITELL  tests to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. This data provides information  on the student’s listening, speaking, reading and writing skills  and allows us to determine the level of instruction. Students in  our school consistently did best on the speaking portion of the tests. Scores are generally lowest in writing. For example,  on  the latest  NYSESLAT, results shows that scores of  students  on the Speaking portion of the test ranged from  12 to 21.  Scores on the writing portion ranged from  0 to 12. The lower writing scores of ELLs  indicate that writing  strategies  must  continue to be strengthened as much as possible in ENL and in content area classes.   Several software programs , such as Castle Learning, Brain Pop and Grad Point, are used in our computer lab by the content-      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      area teachers and the ENL teacher, giving  another diagnostic tool to assess ELLs' writing skills as well as strengthen  them.  Teachers also have access to Castle Learning, a software program which helps teachers design assessment options for  students, including ELLs. We have purchased IPads for our ELLs to use in content area classes and in pull-out classes where  they use software, such as Brain Pop, to strengthen their literacy skills. Through our inquiry teams, committees of teachers  from different content areas meet and analyze data from quarterly assessments and, as part of this, aggregate data for ELLs to  target interventions they may need.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Literacy skills are emphasized during pull-out classes with the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher works closely with the  ELA teachers on all levels to ascertain weaknesses in reading and writing. The  ENL teacher works with the ELA teachers to  modify assignments for entering and emerging ELLs and to prepare all ELLs  for the ELA Regents exam.  Through our inquiry teams, committees of teachers from different content areas meet and analyze data from quarterly  assessments and, as part of this, aggregate data for ELLs to target interventions they may need. ELLs are also eligible  to  attend our after-school classes for help in core subjects and in the fall and spring we hold after school and Saturday classes  for Regents prep.  The ENL teacher meets periodically with teacher teams to assess the progress of ELLs in their classes and to support  instructional planning efforts. The teams come up with scaffoldiing strategies and differentiated instruction for ELLs  if needed.  The ENL teacher will often pull out ELLs to specifically target weaknesses in essay writing.  We also use translated copies of novels and non-fiction books read in ELA classes.  Our  computer labs and Ipads are loaded with software programs, such as Achieve 3000 and Castle Learning, to help students  with reading comprehension and writing.  Results of the ELL Periodic Assessments and the NYSESLAT are carefully reviewed by the ENL teacher to assess the weakest and  most proficient skills of the students. Assessments normally show weakness in reading and writing, and scaffolding strategies  have been devised to best support ELLs in their content areas.    A full range of testing accommodations are given to ELLs. Accommodations include time and a half extensions, separate  locations, bilingual glossaries for word-for-word translations, an interpreter if the state does not provide a written translation  for a test- such as the Regents - and allowing  written responses in the native language.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by results of the NYSESLAT test, their grades in content-area courses, and  their results on the Regents exams. For example, on the NYSESLAT,  we see whether the student has progressed from  Entering  to Emerging or from Transitional to Commanding.   Most of our ELLs have more  difficulty with reading and writing  skills on the NYSESLAT and other assessments than with speaking and listening comprehension.  In addition, we use a MOSL  performance task at the beginning of the year to establish a benchmark for ELLs who have been in the public schools for more  than one year; those students are administered another MOSL at the end of the year. This exam shows their gains in ELA  performance. Regents results are disaggregated to show performance advances in ELLs. We also give Quarterly Assessments in  each course that are also disaggregated to show results for ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    This year our school will be using Data Analysis and the AMAO tool  to focus on the progress of our ELLs and, with that  information, design effective instruction programs and interventions for those students if needed.  We can analyze scores on  their NYSESLAT, ELA and Math progress, attendance, credits accumulated and SIFE status.   This tool will also alert us to  ELLs  who show risk factors , so we can tailor more targeted interventions for at-risk populations.  The data reveals that students have more difficulty in ELA and Global History  than in math and science. We are trying to  determine whether this is due to essays that are required in those classes, because we have found that in examining results of  the NYSESLAT, our ELLs show lower proficiency in reading and writing than in the other modalities. Students also seem to fare  better in math, due to strong math skills in their native countries. However, despite lower  grades in ELA, students who took  the ELA Regents have done better than on other Regents. Thiscould be  due to the  fact that students who took the exam were       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         in the 11th grade and were in US public schools longer than those taking Regents in the ninth and tenth grades.  We have also ascertained that students with good attendance generally fare better than those who are frequently absent.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our program is modeled on the RtI approach, which includes universal screening; a strong core instruction; intensive, tailored  instruction; and progress monitoring. Screening includes administering the HLIS to uncover factors that could influence the  student's English language learning process and help us decide which areas of instruction need to be targeted. We offer a  strong core instruction, making sure there is collaboration between teachers and students.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   These results show that reading and writing skills must be reinforced. Students who have been in this country longer  consistently do better on speaking and listening parts. The reading and writing scores are lower in part due  to interrupted  education in this country for some students,  and poor reading and writing skills when they first arrived in the U.S.            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   These findings are available to guidance counselors, who program the ELL classes, to the content-area teachers, and to the  assistant principals of instruction. Results of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL  provide evidence of which competencies need to be  addressed. This includes determining the amount and type of ENL instruction and deciding whether the student needs home  language support. The ENL teacher coordinates and collaborates with the content area teachers on ways to modify  assignments and assessments for ELLs if needed. For example, the ENL teacher will often pull out students to work  on assignments in Global or ELA or any other content area work deemed difficult for the ELL. Because we are a small school,  the ENL teacher is able to discuss the needs of the ELL population with each content area teacher on an as-needed basis. She  provides coaching as well as push-in support; and classroom teacher and ENL teacher share findings in grade team and  department team meetings.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    1.The goal of our Freestanding ENL program is to provide academic content-area instruction in English using ENL  methodology and instructional strategies, and using native language support to make content comprehensible.  a.) Based on NYSESLAT scores, students are categorized as entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and  commanding.     We  use stand alone ENL and Integrated ENL.  In integrated  ENL, the ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration  with the content-area teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. .  The ENL teacher primarily  pushes into the core classes; for example,  Living Environment, Earth Science, Algebra, Global Studies, and English  Language Arts.    Most students who are in stand-alone ENL are designated at entering or emerging levels, and the class  serves to give  them more intensive literacy skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening.  They are never pulled out of their core       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         classes. The only classes they are pulled out of are electives such as Art or Music. Students in the stand-alone  ENL  classes are grouped together both as ungraded and heterogeneous.   During integrated ENL,  the ENL teacher serves as a co-teacher with the content-area teacher. Co-planning sessions  are conducted by the teachers during their preparation periods and the two strategize before classes. In some cases,  ELLs with the same home language may be paired or grouped together within the class solely to assist  one another with the subject area. At higher levels, integrated ENL is conducted with any content area that meets the  needs of the student, especially in Regents classes.  Students are placed by grade heterogeneously, except for those in ICT classes, who usually  travel together as a group.           b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    In our Freestanding ENL model, the ENL teacher ensures that entering  ELL students are provided 540 minutes per week of ESL  instruction, both stand alone and integrated.  Entering students receive one unit of study : (180 minutes) in ENL, one unit in  ENL/ELA, and one unit in either Stand alone ENL or integrated ENL in a content area.   Emerging students receive 360 minutes, with 90 minutes in stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes in ENL/ELA. The remaining 90  minutes are either stand alone or integrated ENL.   Transitioning students receive 90 minutes in ENL/ELA and 90 minutes in either stand alone ENL or Integrated ENL for a total of  180 minutes per week.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes in ENL/Content area per week.    Commanding students who have passed the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes of study per week in Integrated ENL- in  ELA/content areas or other ELL services for two extra years. They also receive the same testing accommodations for two years  as they did before they passed the NYSESLAT. All  stand-alone classes are taught by a certified ENL teacher. Integrated ENL is  taught by an ENL teacher with other individually certified teachers.    This model promotes collaboration between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher and decreases class-instruction time  loss.  Advanced students, who require fewer ENL instructional minutes, are mostly seen in their content area classes, as many of  them will be taking Regents exams in January or June. Those who may be struggling with content-area classes can see the  ENL  teacher on the teacher's prep periods. All ELLs can participate in our Regents prep classes after school.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    All programs for ELLs are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. These programs use a balanced approach to  literacy, including high-quality instructional practices that facilitate academic excellence.   Content areas are delivered by licensed content area teachers who, with the help of the ENL teacher, teach strategies using an  ENL approach. In the content area classes, teachers use differentiated instruction for ELLs, sometimes grouping or pairing  them together as needed. A cluster of students who have the same native language in classrooms may be seated together to  allow students to access content by interacting with each other at various levels of language skills.   Teachers focus on the development of academic writing which is specific to the content area. They also use bilingual  glossaries for their particular subject area. Content-area teachers are also offered QTEL classes. These skills will be further  reinforced at professional development sessions throughout the year and with the purchase of books designed to assist these  teachers with ELL student needs.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      Native language support for ELLs is also afforded. The majority of our ELLs are Spanish speaking and the ENL  teacher, who  speaks Spanish,  uses their native language as needed when helping students in the content areas.   In English Language Arts, a beginner student may be allowed to use the native language translation of a novel if needed.  For  example, new ELLs were given a translated copies of The Pearl and Romeo and Juliette, required reading for ninth grade ELA.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Aside from the Spanish Lab test, students are evaluated in class by the ENL teacher, who is fluent in Spanish and French.  Fiction and non-fiction books are available in the native language for all ELLs.    Students are asked to bring in native language reading materials so the teacher can assess their reading comprehension in the  native language. The ENL teacher tries to use the student's native language whenever possible. Offering both language  development and support for content instruction in the native language is helpful for ELLs because it accelerates literacy in  both native language and English and boosts the student's self-esteem.  Native language support, such as the use of bilingual dictionaries and strategic homogeneous linguistic grouping in the ENL  class , is used.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students receive literacy instruction which has been specially designed to accelerate learning. They can receive  extended instruction in after-school programs which provide extra help in content area classes and in Regents prep classes  given before January and June Regents. Because our SIFE students must make up the academic skills they have missed, the  small-group instruction they receive in pull-out classes best serves their needs. Material covered in content areas is reinforced  and help is offered where needed.   b. For ELLs in US schools for less than three years, students need accelerated instruction to pass the ELA exam required for  them after one year. Academic intervention for these newcomers includes intensive vocabulary and reading strategies in their  stand alone ENL classes to reinforce the ELA content class. They also use Achieve 3000, a reading and writing tool, in the  computer lab or ELA classroom. .  c. ELLs receiving service from 4 to 6 years need a variety of stimulated instruction. Effort is made to offer modern day readings,  use the computer lab and provide advanced intensive writing skills. For example, in 12th grade ELA,  the ENL teacher pushes in  to help students at this level with writing their college essays.   d. Long-term ELLs who have completed 6 years of service could be in danger of dropping out. However, in our school they are  mainstreamed into the general population so they do not feel isolated and are encouraged to join our after- school clubs such  as weight training and exercise, where they are open to meeting American students. LTE students are offered differentiated  instruction in both the push-in and pull-out environments. During push-in, the ENL teacher works separately with the LTE’s  with the help of the content-area teacher. The ESL teacher also works separately with LTE’s in the ESL classroom where she  can provide support to the students on assignments from their content area classes.  e.  Former ELLs who have tested proficient or commanding are provided transitional ENL classes for two years.  They, as well as  their content teachers,  are informed of regulations governing  testing accommodations allowed to them for two years after  testing proficient. They may be given tutorials if needed by content-area teachers .      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?       ELLs identified as having special needs can thrive in our small group, differentiated instruction when they are in stand alone  ENL. Special education students who may exhibit behavioral problems may be encouraged to work separately with the ENL       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      teacher in the content area class.  These students are also helped by a special education teacher who works with students in  the content-area classes.  Both the ENL teacher and the special education teacher confer regularly on the progress of ELL- SWDs.   Teachers of ELL-SWDs periodically review the student’s IEP to ensure they are receiving all mandated services and that those  who need ESL instruction are receiving it.  The IEP’s are distributed to the ENL teacher at the beginning of the school year. The ENL teacher also attends the annual IEP  evaluation with the special education teacher and the guidance counselor.At-risk students are provided targeted instructional  support to increase development in specific areas. This is in conjunction with home language support services. RTI approaches  will be applied to ELL students with disabilities who enter our school with lower levels of proficiency  in the home language.  We base our instruction on the three tiers of instruction and intervention support, using research-based intervention  strategies. Students in our school have access to leveled grade appropriate books, such as adaptations of classics or current  fiction. We have texts available at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. Students also use our computer labs which  provide software programs such as Castle Learning, Brain Pop and Grad Point, a credit recovery program.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    ELL-SWDs have access to an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classroom. They are mainstreamed into the general education  population and  are taught by the special education teacher and the content-area teacher in four core subjects. The ENL  teacher sees the student in the integrated ENL class  or, depending on the student's level,  can see the ELL-SWD student in a  stand alone  setting during one of their elective classes.Some of our Spanish bilingual ELL-SWDs have a bilingual para with  them throughout the day, who can assist them with academic content. Depending on the recommendation of their IEPs, ELL- SWDs  also have a resource room available where they have access to differentiated materials according to their specific  needs.    We have a self-contained program where the needs of ELL-SWDs are met through small group instruction in  consultation with the ENL. We have also provided iPads to ELL-SWDs for bilingual translations of texts as well as to provide  translations of academic language. The ENL and SBST leader meet together in IEP meetings and consult about the needs of the  ELL-SWDs throughout the year and during IEP meetings. As well, ENL teacher and Special Education teachers collaborate by  teaching together in team-taught classrooms.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs with 0 to 3 years of service receive integrated ENL instruction  in the content areas in addition to the mandated ENL  instruction.  The ENL teacher co-plans and co-teaches with the content area teacher to offer intervention services to the  newcomers. Students with 4 to 6 years of service and long-terms ELL learners receive integrated ENL  services as well as  support with Achieve 3000. A ninth period in our school, which offers credit-bearing courses such as Participation in  Government, Economics and Shakespearean Theater, will also provide these students additional language support. English is  primarily used for support but Spanish is used as well if deemed necessary, especially for newcomers.  Using the RtI approach with ELLs, we provide rigorous, evidence-based curriculum by introducing them to academic language,  focusing on vocabulary development  through comon-core aligned texts and software programs.  The after school program in academic areas is open to ELLs who need additional support. We offer PM tutoring sessions in  math, Global Studies, science and English. Throughout the year,  our school holds Regents prep classes in science, math, Global  Studies, US History  and English. Prep classes for the PSAT and SAT are also offered.  All ELLs on any level can participate.   All  classes are taught in English; however, we have some Spanish-speaking staff who can provide assistance.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      As the number of students who take Regents exams grows, so has the extent of our offerings in after-school program for  Regents Prep classes and for elective classes, all of which are open to all ELLs. The results of the the NYSESLAT  will be closely  reviewed this year for any improvements  necessary.  We are also expanding our college counseling services with more       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      emphasis on including ELLs. We plan to increase after-school classes to target math and ELA support. We are implementing a  Response to Intervention model to provide ELLs with a rigorous , culturally responsive instruction. We will continue to  purchase more Ipads for ELLs for help with literacy skills and with translations in integrated classes. We have been increasing  purchases of software programs, such as Brain Pop and Grad Point, which are used in the computer lab with content area  teachers or in the stand-alone ENL classes on IPads.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      NA     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs have access to all school programs, both athletic and academic. They can take after-school courses  taught by the  school's gym teacher; they  have access to all Regents Prep classes and all elective courses such as Economics, Participation in  Government and and Drama. A journalism class producing this year's yearbook is being attended by ELLs as well.  All ELLs can  participate in PSAL teams in the school building, such as football, baseball, soccer, track and tennis.  They can also participate  in our after-school and tutorial classes. 'They attend PSAT and SAT prep classes after school.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   We have a wide assortment of texts offered on 4 different levels. These include fiction and non-fiction reading for  intermediate and advanced students.  Beginner students have several books for their level, including the Step by Step series  and Milestones. All students are provided dictionaries and glossaries and can use software programs provided by some of their  texts for use in the computer lab.  We also used a variety of software programs  to strengthen reading comprehension and language acquisition, as well as  content areas. Teachers use Castle Learning, a computer program which helps them design assessment , ESL Brain Pop, and  Grad Point, a credit-recovery program. .  This can be used in the ENL resource room  or our computer lab. ELLs use IPads  in  their integrated content classes or in the ENL classroom. Students also have access to the school library, which provides fiction  and non-fiction books in  French, Spanish and Arabic.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    The ENL teacher can provide native language support to Spanish and French speaking students The majority of our ELLs  speak  Spanish.The ENL teacher sees the ELLs in integrated ENL classes and can translate content when necessary.  We have also purchased translated texts in the students' native language. Last year students were provided translated texts of  The Pearl, Mice and Men, the Crucible, the Great Gatsby, and Catcher in the Rye for their ELA  classes.  ELLs also use  dictionaries in class and can use on-line translated programs in the computer lab. They also receive help with their home  language by using Ipads.  Students can use computerized translators for Regents exams or can be provided translated versions of their Regents exams.  Since there are no translated Regents for Arabic-speaking students, we hire Arabic translators when they take Regents.  ELLs are also provided bilingual glossaries for  their content area classes      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our required services support and resources correspond to ELLs'  ages and grade levels.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We participate in a building-wide counseling program which includes a psychologist who works with our ELLs , a nurse who  coordinates health services including birth control,  a speech therapist and an occupational therapist. There is also a building- wide sharing of advanced placement class registration. In addition, there is a regular PPT meeting that includes building-wide  counselors who discuss individual student caseloads, including ELLs.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In August,  ELLs are able to participate in a two-week optional program at our school focusing on environmental studies.  Students take a credited English class and work with the Waterfront Alliance, taking trips to a nearby marina, kayaking, and  participating in environmental cleanup activities on Rockaway Beach and in parks.. Several staff members are involved in the  programs, such as an assistant principal, a school counselor and the parent coordinator. An orientation  is held in August for  parents of incoming freshmen.  In early September, our school holds freshman orientation for students and parents, where  they meet their new teachers. Each teacher addresses the parents at an assembly, describing the course and curriculum.    Translated letters are sent out to LEP parents alerting them to the orientations.    New ELLs enrolled throughout the school year are provided with translated information on procedures in our school. Each new  ELL is assigned a "buddy" who preferably speaks the ELL's lanaguage and  is in the same classes, to assist the new ELL in getting  to their classes and orienting them in the lunchroom and gym. In addition, the parent coordinator assists the student in  acclimating to the new school.      When the ELL first enters our school, the ENL teacher alerts all their content area  teachers to their language and level. A  conference with the teachers of the new ELL is held as well.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs are offered levels 1,2, and 3 in Spanish.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. All staff members who teach ELLs may avail themselves of professional development courses, which are given periodically  by the Department of Education Office of English Language Learners. Staff can register on the DOE Protraxx website to enroll in  courses geared for high school ELLs, which showcase strategies, curricula and academic intervention across various content  areas.  At least 15 percent of required professional development hours for all teachers are dedicated to language acquisition .  This includes a focus on co-teaching strategies and ways to integrate language and content instruction for ELLs. We also send  teachers to QTEL, which is a five-day series of meetings with other ENL teachers. In addition to ELL professional development  courses outside of the school, the ENL teacher also makes herself available to content-area teachers throughout the school  day, especially when she co-teaches with them in their classrooms.     Teachers of ELLs can participate in classes offered by the Department of Education's Office of English Language Learners. The  courses cover the acquisition of language development and how it is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  In       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         addition, a teaching coach at our school gives weekly professional development classes, when  teaching strategies  for the  Common Core  are discussed with all staff. For the ENL teacher, half of the required PD hours deal with language acquisition  in  alignment with core content areas.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.        1. All staff members who teach ELLs may avail themselves of professional development courses, which are given periodically  by the Department of Education Office of English Language Learners. Staff can register on the DOE Protraxx website to enroll in  courses geared for high school ELLs, which showcase strategies, curricula and academic intervention across various content  areas.  At least 15 percent of required professional development hours for all teachers is dedicated to language acquisition .  This includes a focus on co-teaching strategies and ways to integrate language and content instruction for ELLs. We also send  teachers to QTEL, which is a five-day series of meetings with other ENL teachers. In addition to ELL professional development  courses outside of the school, the ENL teacher also makes herself available to content-area teachers throughout the school  day, especially when she co-teaches with them in their classrooms.   Teachers of ELLs can participate in classes offerd by the  Department of Education's Office of English Language Learners. The courses cover the acquisition of language development  and how it is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  In addition, a teaching coach at our school gives weekly  professional development classes, when  teaching strategies  for the Common Core  are discussed with all staff. For the ENL  teacher, half of the required PD hours deal with language acquisition in  alignment with core content areas.   All staff are  offered turnkey professional development at weekly faculty meetings.  Staff meetings and staff development days are held  when ENL strategy training is provided by the ENL teacher in collaboration with administrators and outside consultants. All  agendas and attendance records of the PD meetings are retained by teachers and the school secretary.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the four parent-teacher meetings throughout the year our school provides an annual meeting with the parent or  guardian of all ELLs  where we  discuss the goals of our program, the progress of the student's language development, the  results of the NYSESLAT tests, and language needs in their content areas. The meeting is conducted with a translator in the  parent's native language, if necessary. Before the meetings, the ENL teacher consults on a one-on-one basis with each content  area teacher to get their latest assessment of the students' progress. Any data from Quarterly Assessments or exams are  shared with the ENL teacher in preparation for the meeting. The child's guidance counselor is also present.   Agendas for the meetings include language acquisition goals, review of progress, most recent assessment results, and any  language development needs. Phone calls are also exchanged between  teacher and parent. The school has several teachers  and paraprofessionals who speak Spanish, one teacher who speaks Russian,  and one teacher who speaks French to  accommodate the students' language needs.  We also have a 9  th   grade orientation every September for all students and  parents as well as a summer bridge program for entering 9th grade students where students' ELL needs are assessed.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Our school has a Parents Association which meets once a month. Parents are apprised of school events, with opportunities for  a question-answer period.  All meetings with ELL parents and correspondence with them are translated into the family's native       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         language. Two workshops for parents called "Options for College" are available for ELL parents to inform them of financial aid  options for students, with translators available.    On average we get two non-native language speakers attending Parent Workshops in a year. Our goal this year is to increase  that number by reaching out through phone calls by native speakers. As well, we will be translating all documents for parent  workshops. We also hire translators for our Arabic students for Regents exams.  During Parent-Teacher conferences,  translators are available to accompany parents to each meeting with the teachers. In early September, we held an orientation  meeting for all parents of ninth-grade students that included translators.    During the parent orientations, ELL parents are informed of the resources available to them in our school and in the  community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Connolly, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Rockaway Park HS                                                                              School DBN: 27Q324  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Within 30 days of a new student's enrollment, our school determines the primary language spoken by the parent  of each student as indicated on the Home Language Identification Survey, and whether the parent requires  language assistance to communicate with the Department of Education. All parents of students enrolled in our  school receive a language survey form which is translated into the covered languages --the nine most common  primary languages other than English . Parents are asked "In what language would you like to receive written  information from the school?" and "In what language would you prefer to communicate orally with school staff?"    Our school keeps a current record of the primary language of each parent, culled from the HLIS and through an  interview with the parent or guardian when the child is enrolled. This information is kept in ATS and on the  student emergency card. In meetings regarding critical information about a student's education, parents whose       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      primary language is Spanish or French are provided interpretation services by bilingual staff members. These  meetings can range from annual IEP meetings to discussions with the student's guidance counselor. Parents  whose primary language is not English or Spanish use the the telephone services of the Translation and  Interpretation Unit within the Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Interpretation services are provided  to limited English proficient parents  whose primary language is a covered  language and who request such  services for school meetings such as  parent-teacher conferences which are  held four times a year in September,  November, March and May.   On September 9, our school held our  annual orientation for all parents of  ninth-graders which included LEP  parents. We have at least 3 staff  members who are bilingual in Spanish  and French and are present at such  meetings and can assist the guidance  counselors with calls and meetings.  They can also assist the attendance  teachers. We also provide translations  for LEP parents and guardians who  require an IEP meeting.    Fo LEP parents whose language is not  Spanish , we call the Translation and  Interpretation Unit within the Office  for Family Engagement and Advocacy  for interpretation. We can also hire an   9/2017 orientation meeting for  freshmen   Parent-teacher conferences 11/2017   3/2018 and 5/2018   We will call the Translation and  Interpretation unit for translating  during parent-teacher conferences.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Phone numbers of all LEP parents are kept by the ENL teacher and the main office. We have staff available who speak  Spanish, which the majority of ELL families speak. For other languages, we request parents and guardians when they  admit their child to list an emergency contact on the blue card of a relative or friend who speaks English.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      We will hold a Professional Development meeting for school staff on Language Outreach and Access. The ENL teacher,  who also serves as the LAC coordinator, keeps the staff updated on services, either through emails or staff meetings.  We plan to hold a meeting or PD session exclusively on translation and interpretation services.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We will provide each Limited English Proficient parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require  language assistance with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding  translation and interpretation services.    Our school will post near the primary entrance to our school a sign in each of the covered languages indicating the  availability of interpretation services.    Each school's safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching our administrative offices due to language barriers.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77      Parents of more than 10% of children who speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered language  will receive from the Translation Unit a translation into their language of signage and forms.   Parent events, such as our parent orientation PTA meetings and teacher conferences will be translated by either our  staff, who speak Spanish, French and Russian, and staff from the Translation unit.    Brochures, flyers and letters for LEP parents will be translated by the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit, as all  languages spoken in our school are covered languages.    The DOE website will provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of parents to  translation and interpretation services and how to access those services.              Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will mail a survey home to all LEP parents. If we do not get feedback from them we will contact them by phone,  using one of our bilingual staff members or accessing the translation and interpretation unit. . We will also gather  feedback about the availability of our services at parent orientation meetings and in one-on-one interviews at parent- teacher conferences.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78
