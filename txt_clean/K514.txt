The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Founded in 2004, Frederick Douglass Academy VII is a secondary school focused on the academic, social, and  emotional needs of all our students. Regardless of their level of entry, we build on the knowledge, thinking, and  confidence that all students need to be college and career ready through the collaboration of the school  administration, faculty, staff, and parents. Students will be engaged through diverse academic and social programs.  Our school is committed to using all its resources to positively impact the [Brownsville/surrounding] community.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Frederick Douglass Academy VII (FDA VII) high School will serve approximately 150 students in 2018-2019, grade 9  through grade 12. Over ninety percent of our students enter grade 9 with Level 1 and Level 2 scores in English  Language Arts and Mathematics. Furthermore, 20%-25% of our students enroll over the counter. Hence, we  strategically program students who transfer from out of state/country into (FDA VII) to meet promotion and  graduation requirements. Approximately, 13% -15% of our student population reside in temporary housing or double- up with relatives/non-relatives. Despite the unique and diverse needs of the student body the school has established  a strong and positive school culture that nurtures and encourages each child to strive to reach their potential.    We engage students and families in a variety of activities to build school community, address social and emotional  and academic needs. For example, every September the school hosts a Curriculum Night BBQ for parents and school  partners. This is an opportunity for parents to meet and greet teachers, to receive transcripts and progress report  updates, and to learn about and meet school partner organizations. Additionally, an annual overnight trip is held in  October/November for grade 9 and grade 10 students focused on team building and character building activities.    Throughout the year the administrative team thinks of ideas to create meaningful experiences for our students. For  example, the travel club has raised over $100,000 since 2017 via Gofund me to send students to Barcelona, Spain  (Summer 2017) and Japan (Summer 2018). Students and families engaged in fundraising events such as an art auction  held at a local minority-female owned "cakery" shop.    Furthermore, over the last decade the school has forged partnerships with numerous organizations to strengthen and  positively impact academic performance and our school culture. A few key partnerships include AP for All (expansion  of AP courses offered at FDA VII), College Access for All (expansion of college and career readiness supports offered to  students), CAMBA (social-emotional workshops), Grace Church (members provide on-site tutoring after school to  students), NYC Mayor’s Office Single Shepherd program (every 100 students are assigned a Guidance Counselor or  Social Worker who “moves-up” with the cohort) among others. Last year, we added Open Door Arts -In Education  Project (ODAEP) to our list of partners. ODAEP provides direct instruction on web-design, virtual reality and design  techniques.   Next year, FDA will partner with the Boys and Girls Club of America (B&GCA). B&GCA will augment our current  extracurricular activities and efforts to address obstacles faced by our youth. B&GCA offers an array of programs  including college and career readiness (ex. Career Launch, diplomas2degrees, etc.), athletic clubs and STEM courses.  B&GCA has a track record of success reflected by “73% of club members ages 12-17 received mostly As and Bs” in  school and “ 91% of ninth graders abstain from marijuana and alcohol use.” We are excited about adding this new  partnership to the aforementioned programs offered at FDA VII.         3.

Additionally, quantitative and qualitative data reveal that students, including SWD and ELLs,  struggle with writing, reading comprehension and vocabulary. These conclusions are based on student work samples,  formative assessments and Regents data.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 academic year our school engaged in activities that focused on all elements of the Framework  for Great Schools. However, the greatest gains were made in the areas of Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers  and Effective Leadership.   This year (2018-2019), the school’s instructional foci are Rigorous Instruction and Collaborative Teachers. Our goal is  to strengthen teachers’ pedagogy in the areas of reading comprehension of short answer questions and essay tasks,  and facilitation of writing strategies to strengthen students’ ability to accurately respond to short answer questions  and essay tasks. School administrators will engage in professional learning facilitated by the Superintendent’s Office,  New Visions and other professional activities to strengthen effective leadership, and the professional growth and  development of the faculty.   This year, based on student data (summative and formative), NYC Survey Report results and feedback from our  constituents (faculty, staff, students and parents) we will target the following Framework for Great Schools Elements :  Rigorous Instruction, see above paragraph (student data, student feedback and classroom visits), Supportive  Environment (NYC Survey results, class visits, student and faculty feedback) and Trust (NYC Survey results,class visits,  student and faculty feedback).                         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 23K514   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   157   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Share and evaluate marking period data to assess teacher/ department grading, student performance and  potential credit accumulation/promotion.     Data analysis of interim assessments (ex. midterms and January final exams) and formative assessments   during teacher team cycles.     Professional development time (teacher team cycles and intervisitation cycles ) will be used to share multiple   assessment examples and modification for ELLs and SWDs     Teachers create and share examples of multiple assessments for students to demonstrate their   understanding.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Frederick Douglass Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Frederick Douglass Academy VII will support parents and families of Title I (SWP) students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children; such as how to evaluate a transcript, strategic individualized  promotion and graduation planning, etc.   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57      ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Advisors will establish school-home contact and serve as a liaise between the home and school.      .engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  During the  2016-2017 school year, all students at FDA VII took the Empower3000 level set assessment or diagnostic  assessments.  Empower3000 differentiates non-fiction text according to individual student Lexile level and utilizes common  core skill based questions to assess student comprehension .   The data indicates an average Lexile level of 600-700 (3rd and  4th grade) reading level.  Additionally, ELLs students struggle with  identification to support interpretations and decisions  about relative significance of information with explicit statement, evidence and appropriate argument. Based on the results  ELLs struggle to synthesize information from diverse sources and identify complexities and discrepancies in the  information.  Teacher generated assessment results indicate identification of central idea and corresponding supporting       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      details as an area of concern.  Assessments mimic ELA Regents (part 1 and part 2)  and NY Performance Task, writing from  sources.  Furthermore a review of ELL short answer, multiple-choice and extended responses demonstrates a below grade  level use of accurate vocabulary words.             2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To address the identified areas of concern, department and grade teams meet weekly to engage in the tuning protocol to  assess progress in the use of academic vocabulary, evidence to support a claim and the development of a claim.  The grade  team and content area teams assess ELL student work samples and determine instructional shifts and strategies to support  growth.  As a result, of the student work tuning protocol focus strategies are identified and implemented.  For instance, the  RACE(S) strategy has been identified to develop student short answer responses/paragraphs to claim based  prompts.  Additionally, the use of words walls, vocabulary cards, and explicit vocabulary strategies, such as, the Frayer model  quick writes/journal entries are utilized to  increase student use and comprehension of vocabulary in listening, writing, and  speaking and reading.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our programs for ELLs is evaluated through a variety of means that include the following: credit accumulation,  NYSESLAT scores, the ELL Periodic Assessment, Regents and LOTE scores, college and career readiness, and graduation rates.  Furthermore, analysis of data from the AMAO Estimator Tool has helped drive instuction. Additionally, grade teams and  department teams work with the ENL teacher to ensure that ELLs are included in the planning of lessons so they are able to  participate perform on the same level as their peers in subject areas by translating materials as well as scaffolding activities.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    FDA VII Guidance Department and administration meets with ELLs to complete a transcript review at the end each term to  identify credit accumulation and Regents requirement deficits.  Additionally, ELL students participate in marking period  assemblies to individually review their academic progress.  ELL's are scheduled daily for advisory, in which they assess their  academic performance in each course via Jupiter Grades (online grading system).   To address concerns academic intervention  options include peep tutoring, after school tutoring, Saturday prep, and elective intervention course such as, Empower3000  and Transition to Math.  Furthermore, scaffolds and differentiation is included in daily instruction in all content areas.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not Applicable     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Majority of ELLs score emerging to transitioning on the writing modality of the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT.  For students at  the  transitioning and expanding levels, the lowest modality scores were in the listening and writing sections.  The emerging  level students received the lowest scores on the writing modality. The NYSESLAT modality data indicates that the majority of  the ELL population has a firm grasp on the Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) required for the type of  conversational exchanges represented on the Speaking modality of the test. The students require further instruction in  Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) for understanding the type of academic input from this past year’s Listening  section and producing academic writing in the Writing section.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Program adjustments are made continually in department and grade teams based on data from summative assessment such  as, Regents, MOSL, NYSESLAT, PSAT's, and SAT's. Adjustments are made to daily instruction, unit, pacing calendar and       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         curriculum according to students needs identified in team meetings.     During weekly  professional development staff meets to identify instructional shifts based on summative assessment findings  to address areas of concern.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       Instruction for all ELLs is delivered in English in small group instruction. ELLs are placed in groups depending on task  and sometimes according to their English language proficiency based on either the NYSESLAT or the NYSITELL. The  ENL teacher analyzes the data from both tests as well as the data from the classroom teacher’s continuous  assessments. This information from both ENL teacher and content teachers help make effective decision as to how to  instruct their ELL(s). When possible all beginner students are buddied up with a scholer who speaks and understands  the ELLs’ home language if the classroom teacher is unable to communicate. Classroom instruction includes:   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   ELL students are identified through the ELL Identification Process and ATS reports (RLAT, RESI, and RNMR) and programmed as  per the CRPart 154 requirement for English a New Language grades 9-12, minimum number of minutes according the  NYSESLAT levels. Subsequently, ELL students are programmed according to CRPar 154 according to proficiency level.    ELA and ENL instruction is a part of the integrated ENL course offered at FDA VII.  A vast majority of ENL students are  programmed for integrated ENL (as noted in STARS) which provides an opportunity to receive ENL hours according to their  proficiency levels. Additionally, our program includes stand alone hours according to NYSESLAT performance levels.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL Teacher uses current research in the field of Second Language Acquisition to help classify the needs of ELLs in their  various stages of development. The majority of the ELL population has mastered BICS according to the anticipated acquisition  period of 2 years. Based on assessment, the language needs of the students lie in developing specific academic language, and  the curriculum is adjusted to focus on these skills. The ESL teacher additionally works with subject area teachers to make  academic language instruction explicit and consistent for the continued language development of ELLs in all subject areas.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Through blended learning via online assessments and academic tools such as, Empower3000 bilingual component student  receive support in their native language. The tool provides multiple opportunities to engage with non-fiction text and respond  to text-dependent questions in various languages. Reports are available according to Lexile, common core standards, and  activity completion to shift pedagogical practices and strategies.      By means of dual text ELLs  are evaluated in their home languages. Dual resources are identified via online resources,  textbooks, previous regents exams offered in multiple languages, and Google translate.  ELL students are provided with  feedback, next steps and grades in their home language during instructional periods and individual conferencing.     Ultimately, content is delivered in target language and home language via Google translate, Google Drive, textbooks, glossaries  and dictionaries, and multiple language text.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     Our SIFE students receive daily instructions in ENL, ELA and NLA. SIFE students with strong native language get  instructions that target the use of their language for content in all subjects. Extended day, Saturday Academy and tutoring are  also given to our SIFE students. We have noted that SIFE students perform best when they work in small groups so we aim to  group in ways that best serve their individual needs.   b.     Based on the results of their LAB-R/NTSESLAT assessments, newcomers to the English Language School System will  receive their mandated ENL services. Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate needs to facilitate a  smooth transition. In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them in groups with  native English language speakers as well as students who share the same first language as the newcomers. Students will  participate in small group, task-oriented situations that guide the production of language both in verbal and written form.  Students’ seating arrangements will enable them to clearly see and hear the teacher during instruction.   c.      For ELLS receiving services for 4 to 6 years, both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher use scaffolds. Some examples  of scaffolding used include, the use of graphic organizers to organize information, chunking and modification of text and the  use of visuals where possible e.g. video clip, or pictures. In addition different forms of groupings which give many  opportunities for the ELLs to use language are encouraged in most lessons. With these approaches the students will: develop  interpersonal communication skills (the connection between form and structure for English, and their social-functional  meaning; develop the ability to use language by actively employing the students’ information processing capabilities required  to acquire academic language skills that underline reading comprehension and other content areas; use language for a  functional purpose so that language acquisition emerges as a result of the need to communicate while performing academic  activities (the subject matter may be modified so that it is comprehensible to the ELL students).   d.     For long-term ELLs, we plan to run summer school that ensures that ELLs maintain and improve English skills they  acquired during the school year. We Maintain consistency of students' programs and services because we have noted that  inconsistency from year to year had a harder time acquiring English. We also explicitly teach literacy to long-term ELLs, and do  not assume that such students have prior literacy instruction (either in their home language or in English), and we aim to  include infuse literacy instruction across the curriculum. During the school year, academic English is emphasized with this  group of ELLs because the already have full command of BICs but need to improve on the CALP in order to succeed. To this  end, non-fiction content based texts, oral presentations of research and projects based learning are used in the classroom to  enable the Long Terms acquire academic English. Critical thinking is emphasized while building on academic vocabulary within  context.   e.     For ELLs continue to receive academic support for ENL teacher for at least 2 years. This takes the form of extended day       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      assistance, collaboration with content teachers to continue differentiating instructions for these students and a continuation  of academic vocabulary development plan. If the student is struggling in a certain content area, push in and tutoring is  considered immediately.           Our ENL students receive all mandated testing accommodations. In all exams and tests they receive time and a half, a  content glossary and a bilingual dictionary. We endeavor to translate all tests where possible and also utilize interpretation  services assist our students. Our students also take their exams in separate location, and where an article is to be read, the ESL  students get a third reading.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELLs with special needs have access to high-quality instruction designed to help them meet high expectations. Teachers  employ strategies known to be effective with English learners, such as drawing on their prior knowledge; providing  opportunities to review previously learned concepts and teaching them to employ those concepts; organizing themes or  strands that connect the curriculum across subject areas; and providing individual guidance, assistance, and support to fill gaps  in background knowledge. Strategies used for our ESL students with special educational needs include activating the schema  using high interest materials and activities, ENL is intergrated with content, the use of visuals and Total Physical Response,  Explicit teaching of vocabulary within content, contexulized teaching within small groups or pairs. Providing ample  opportunities for students to use language. In addition activities are structured and predictable. We collaborate using these  strategies to provide a learning environment that is conducive for our ENL-SWDs. ELL -SWDs receive ESL program according to  their proficiency level and the NYSESLAT results informs programing for these students..         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ENL-SWDs are provided with content based curriculum taught in general education classes (least restrictive). Scheduling  takes account overall services the students is receiving and we ensure flexibility within the schedule. Flexibility in the schedule  here means that sometimes the ENL teacher pushes into a content area class to support language and other times the student  is pulled out for enrichment or pre-teaching. ELL-SWDs are placed in our ICT program depending on their academic an  behavioral plan. Our goal is to ensure that they continue to thrive in the least restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  English proficient students receive targeted daily instruction provided by our teachers, our in-house intervention system, and  our after school intervention programs in English and Mathematics. Intensive instruction in reading and writing, problem  solving and critical thinking skills were reinforced along with essential test taking strategies.   1. We ensure that our ELLs receive early, explicit, and intensive instruction in phonological awareness and phonics in order to  build decoding skills this intervention is done by the ENL teacher.  2. We make sure that all our classes increase opportunities for ELLs to develop functional vocabulary, in ELA students do a  variety of scaffolded activities to aid the acquisition of academic vocabulary using graphic organizers.   3. We equip ELLs with strategies and knowledge to comprehend and analyze challenging narrative and expository texts  through scaffolding and differention of instructions.  4. We intervene to promote ELLs’ reading fluency focus on vocabulary development and increased exposure to print.  5. We promote independent reading that is both purposeful and structured and good reader-text match therefore in social  studies and science, the teachers chuck text, and use questions to guide reading. For intermediate and beginner students we  cloze text and hands on experiments are done with the students. Including as many visuals as possible to enhance  comprehension.   6.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We have no plans to change our current program for the next academic year unless the number of ELLs increases to more than  20       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not be discontinuing any programs that serve our ELLs either.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All our ELLs, regardless of their proficient level, are required to attend extended program 3 times a week for language  enrichment and intervention in other content areas. ELLs have equal access to all programs that are provided by our school.  Presently all the ELLs are mandated to stay for extended day. Saturday academy and PM school are also offered in our school  and ELLs are given priority to enlist given their needs. We also have an early morning tutoring program which affords our ELLs  with opportunities for further intervention.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support our ELLs, we have a library with an assortment of books in both Spanish and English. We also have supplementary  NYSESLAT preparation books, bilingual dictionaries, computers, technology software such as ELLIS, and access to  Empower3000, which is a reading enrichment program. In addition, some of our classrooms now have Smart Boards;  therefore, our students are able to have more visuals in the classrooms. Students have access to laptops too, which they use to  research in their native languages.    In the content areas student have access to laptops which provide them with access to interpreting for themselves easily.  Teachers   also use the smartboard frequently to show visuals which aid learning.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      We realize the important role of the native language both as the main tool of communication for our students and the  foundation of literacy for our ELLs, and therefore we endeavor to encourage the continual use of the home language by  providing books, music and materials in our students’ home language in our ESL classrooms. We also encourage parents to  continue using the home   language at home so our students can maintain it.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. We have grade level multiliteracies. We also  have simpler reading books for our ESL students to learn the structure of the English Language.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    To support our ELLs, we have a library with an assortment of books in both Spanish and English. We also have supplementary  NYSESLAT preparation books, bilingual dictionaries, computers, technology software such as ELLIS, and access to Achieve3000,  which is a reading enrichment program. In addition, some of our classrooms now have Smart Boards; therefore, our students       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         are able to have more visuals in the classrooms.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activates to assist newly enrolled ENL students before they begin school include a tour of their classrooms and included in the  tour, the bathrooms, cafeteria. We aim to introduce them to their core teachers before they start school so that they are more  comfortable. We also tell them of our buddy system, where they get a classmate, to look after them for a while.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We are planning ongoing school-wide professional development for all teachers on incorporating ENL strategies to make  content comprehensible for ENL and struggling readers and writers. Our ENL teacher and select content-area teachers will  attend Q-TEL trainings many of the outside PDs. In house we dedicate 1 professional development for each semester, unless  teachers make special requests. Our ESL teacher also liaises with content are teachers, to discusses ways in which they can  make their content area more accessible to ELLs. Our current focus is evidence based writing, a requisite of the Common Core  Learning Standards. Our teachers in content have had in house professional development to enable them to participate in a  dialogue on how to ensure that ELLs are getting appropriate scaffolds.        We hold a school-wide orientation for all entering students in the beginning of the year. Freshman teachers regularly meet  to discuss student progress and develop specific lesson designed to facilitate a student’s adjustment to high school. These  professional developments act as platforms for exchanging best practices, where teachers are armed with strategies to  scaffold learning for ELLs.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         Our content teachers and paraprofessionals including our support staff receive support from the ENL teacher to ensure that  the students have a smooth transition and are feel safe in our school.  During the orientation, students and their families are  introduced to their  content teachers.  Students are also paired with a buddy.  Additionally the ENL staff provides professional  development to content area teachers and Saturday Academy teachers. Participating teachers receive support at meetings and  in the classroom on strategies and methodologies pertaining to teaching content to ELLs and developing English language in  the content area.   As of October, ENL teacher prepared and delivered a professional development session sharing strategies of working with  beginner ELLs.  In addition she has visited the content teachers of all the ELLs to discuss specific student needs, scaffolding  strategies and  accommodations.  Since we have a small ELL population, professional developments will be driven by teacher  needs and these will include grade and departmental ELL professional development, professional development specific to  paraprossesionals working with ELLs as tailored talks with our support staff on how to best support our ELLs and their families.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents will be invited to attend individualized meetings during the month of November-December 2017  and February-March  2018, Tuesday to Thursday, one hour per meeting to discuss at home academic supports (Achieve3000, online readers, Khan  academy, regents prep websites,...)  Additionally, parents will engage in a transcript review and graduation requirement  assessment. A total of 12 hours for all sessions facilitated by one teacher (ENL or general ed).  These meetings will be held after  or before school as per the parents schedule to increase participation.Parents will be provided with guiding questions to assess  students current level of performance and next steps.  Parents will receive support with Jupiter Grades log-in  to support  continual review of their child’s progress.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   1.     We have the privilege of having very active parents in our school. Parents volunteer at the cafeteria, assistant in school  wide events, chaperon the students on school trip, provide food for events, fundraise and also assist in the classrooms. We  have a good parent presence outside school, which helps build our community and reinforce safety. We also invite parents to  visit our classrooms in organized tours and by appointment. Some parents have also made the decision to sit in some of the  classes to support their children, if the children were having challenges behavioral or academic in those classes.  Parents also come to our school to share their careers and life experiences without students in certain units. This collaboration  has proved a motivator for both parent participation as well as student performance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tamika Matheson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
