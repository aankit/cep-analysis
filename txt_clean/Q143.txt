This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission statement for PS 143 is: At PS 143Q we strive to instill a love of learning through challenging and  engaging experiences where all students are valued and given every opportunity to succeed. Our school guides us to  make discoveries in reading, writing, the arts and sciences by exploring and experimenting to become critical thinkers.  This exploration is meant to expand our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Our community of  learners will continue to become active, responsible and respectful members of our growing society. Excellence starts  here at PS 143Q!      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      Our school's mission is aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Our focus is and continues to be student  achievement. In order for each child to achieve academic success students are actively engage throughout varies  content areas through rigorous instruction and the supports from their classroom teachers, as well as, cluster  teachers (Social Studies, Science, Theater, Dance, Music, Technology) and other resource providers (Speech,  Occupational Therapist, RTI, and Counselors).           2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 143 is a large k-5 school with a population of 1500 students. We are spread across multiple buildings which  include: one main building, a mini-building, an annex (1) which houses all of our kindergarten students which is  located approximately 1 mile away from the main campus and annex (2) which houses all of our first and second  grade students which is located approximately 2 miles away from the main campus. Each of our buildings also house  our self-contain and integrated classes for our special education students.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   For the 2017-2018 school year, we have 48% of our student body that consists of English as New Language Learners  while another 20% of our students have an IEP. Through teacher collaboration and effective school leadership  teachers are providing scaffolds in the classroom and rigorous instruction that aligns which the Common Core within  and across grades.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2015-2016 school year we made much progress in the category of Collaborative Teachers based on the  Framework for Great Schools by developing grade level teams that supported the schools mission and the overall  success of their students by focusing on student work, data and how the data related to student progress. In the  2016-2017 school year, teachers will continue to collaborate to discuss data and strong practices that will increase  academic performance across grades. For the beginning portion of the year teachers in grade leads will meet weekly  to discuss current work completed, plan together, have discussion about grade work and ask for clarification. After  this the grades leads will meet biweekly to discuss progress and concerns.    For the learning cycle all teachers, paras, clusters, and other support staff will meet every Monday to discuss student  performance, data, current research, together teachers will work in creating assessments to monitor students'  progress, discuss growth, and/or challenges (Inquiry Cycle). At the end of the Inquiry Cycle, teachers will walk away  with strong practices in which they can incorporate in their own classrooms. In addition, teachers along with  administration will continue to grow professionally through continuous collaboration (Differentiated Professional  Development Mondays).    This allows all teachers in K-5 to work collaboratively, share common trends as it promotes leadership throughout the  school.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q143   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1484   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     While pedagogy provides instructional supports, including the school’s instructional focus of strengthening questions  and discussion, the use of strategic entry points and extensions that promote deep reasoning in student work  products varies across the school.   ● Across classrooms, teaching strategies provide for curricula extensions to support students in producing  meaningful work products, but all learners in specific subgroups are not taking ownership of their work and  there are limited opportunities for choice or voice of tasks.  ● In the majority of classes visited questions were teacher-directed with limited opportunities for students  to re-direct their thoughts to peers.   1.1 Curriculum :   ● The school is working towards planning and aligning all curricula to the Common Core Learning Standards  (CCLS) so that higher order skills are consistently emphasized for all learners across grades and content areas.  ● The school’s curricular decisions are on a path to provide all learners with access across grades and content  areas. Academic tasks are being formatted to encourage all students to think beyond the obvious and  increase their higher order thinking skills.  ● Teachers are collecting formative and summative data, but the data collected is not being used for planning  to target students’ needs.   Needs Assessment :    ● Instructionally, ‘rigor’ is being embraced, as is the area of ‘questioning and discussion’ as they relate to  teaching practices across the grade levels and by the support staff and cluster teachers. Increased  understandings around the Danielson rubric for teacher evaluation. These are a work in progress and should  continue to be developed.  ● Access to Instructional materials is becoming strengthened. Continued interest in ReadyGen texts by staff  and students alike is evident.  ● Feedback to staff about their practices is being developed through the use of the Danielson rubric and this  is seen as a developing area of understanding for all.  ● Developing instructional coherence across the administration, thus a shift in focus from predominantly  compliance to balance between that and instruction.  ● The PD Mondays is seen as extremely beneficial and its development needs to continue. Balance between  planned areas of inquiry and mandated requirements that seem to require immediate attention is developing  and needs to continue.  ● Teachers becoming more focused on data analysis and subsequent actions.  ● Students are eager and keen learners who will benefit from the strengthening home/school relationships  underway.  ● Outside Professional development seen as supportive though processes for dissemination still being  established.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         ● Staff wants to do well and want some direction to establish school wide practices and autonomy for those  that are grade specific, which would be in consultation with their supervisor.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In January 2015, our community superintendent came to document, what life is like at our school in a Quality Review.  The document reports areas of strength, as well as areas where improvement is needed to strengthen P.S. 143. An  outside party also conducted a Needs Assessment to address the needs of our school. The following are the results of  these assessments.  Strengths:(QR2015)   · Through teacher teams, consistent examination of student work and data is an ongoing process. Distributive  leadership structures are in place. The work of teacher teams has resulted in greater awareness of how to improve  pedagogy and strengthen student progress on assessments. Shared leadership protocols are used to build capacity  and improve student learning as teachers have input on key decisions, teaching practices and curricula choices.  · Meetings with teacher teams and teacher leads enabled work around looking at data and student products by  focusing on protocols for analyzing results of the Item Skills Analysis for ELA and Mathematics state tests. Teachers  were in accord that these practices help them strengthen their collaboration and supported planning decisions  across the school. Results of team practices indicated that students with disabilities benefited from additional small  group work in mathematics and guided reading.  · Distributed leadership is in evidence in teacher teams. Teachers are rotating roles of facilitating their meetings so  that all members have a voice and equal responsibilities are shared. Teachers posit that the administration has  encouraged them to choose resources for literacy, writing and math that will benefit the students’ styles of  learning.  · Teacher teams review the results from recent baseline reading assessments for end of unit reviews to make  instructional decisions. The teams then share ideas to adjust teaching practices, per grade, aligned to data and  students’ performance tasks. For example, during a team meeting observed, a teacher shared the trends in  analyzing a reading assessment which demonstrated the need for further extensions in context clues and citing  text-based evidence.  · Using Think Central, the electronic portion of Go Math! that generates student reports illustrating the achieved  standards; student targets are tracked and analyzed by teacher team members. For example, during a teacher team  meeting teachers were able to reference the reports and determine what mathematics strategies were used that  worked. Teachers were in accord that this system helps them isolate the standards that still need attention, per  unit, and address students’ individual needs.  Strengths Needs Assessment:   Teachers want and do collaborate with each other and have inclusive practices on most grade levels and across  support teams.  The PD Mondays is seen as extremely beneficial and its development needs to continue. Balance between planned  areas of inquiry and mandated requirements that seem to require immediate attention is developing and needs to  continue.  Outside Professional development seen as supportive though processes for disseminations still being established.  Weaknesses (Needs Assessment )   Developing instructional coherence across the administration, thus a shift in focus from predominantly compliance  to balance between that and instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21      School needs to continue supporting teachers leading and supporting teams for specific goals/tasks. Be ‘inclusive’  of staff in these roles.  School needs to identify which teams will support instructions + those that will support compliance – at times they  may be the same. Have clear objectives for achievement and evaluation of team performance. Once a team is  established with purposes and action clear, they need to be able to be supported to continue throughout the year  School Needs to be “Looking at Student Work” for trends, weaknesses, purposes and actions.  School needs to create school wide schedules to frame the work of the year, e.g. Assessment calendars, PD  meetings. Should be developed prior to the new school year beginning – minor alterations can be made during the  year when necessary. This enables all participants to look forward  School needs to use teams with experience to help develop other teachers in a small group cooperative setting. E.g.  ENL staff to provide information and instructional ideas to Gen Ed teachers.  School needs to be able to ask for clarification, hearing something again if not clear, build trust through really  understanding, thus need to be clear of what is expected, needed or being developed.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   For June 2018, the level of collaboration within and among teacher teams will increase 15% (as outlined by the  Citywide percentage of Positive Response for Elementary Schools in our NYC School Survey 2017-2018 Report)  measured by comparison of 2016 – 2017 Learning Environment Survey.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other  high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under- credited, SIFE, STH).   Teams, groups, committees, et al will spend less time  focusing on norms once established (while adhering to them  accordingly). After setting norms and discussing the creation  and appointment to (and schedule) of leadership positions,  Team members are accountable for knowing the norms  generally and agree to abide by them without constant  review in order to maximize productive time.   Teams, groups, et al will be structured to facilitate continual  progress with a variety of leadership roles, defined by the  group along with norms, that may or may not be regularly  rotated.  Roles may include:  • Team Leader/Coordinator (a team member charged with  facilitating the overall progress of the team by effectively  communicate goals, leading conversations, and mitigating  needs as the arise, the Team Leader would be able to report  to administration and speak to the work of the team and its  moving parts in subcommittees as needed)  • Parliamentarian (aka Rules Referee) (a team member  charged with keeping other members in line with norms and  group established rules, staying on topic, keeping time, etc)  • Project Leader (a team member in charge of a particular  subgroup or project  Record Keeper (a team member in charge of keeping  minutes and attendance distributing them to the  appropriately.

Strengths:     P.S. 143 promotes Project-Based Learning that is an instructional approach built upon authentic learning   activities that engages student interest and motivation. These activities are designed based on a unit of study  and many of them allow students to work in groups. Performance is assessed on an individual basis and to  demonstrate vertical alignment and student growth throughout the years all students are also assessed using  a listening and speaking rubric. Finally, PBL allows students to present their voice and choice, and make  decisions that affect the project.     Teachers are working collaboratively to achieve school goals and student goals.      Teachers, and coaches are working collaboratively in aligning entire curriculum to Common Core Learning   Standards, and the entire school is moving towards a curriculum based approach.       School staff is working together to analyze data and student work. They are supporting students' weaknesses  with researched strategies and are          At the present time the school, as a whole, is moving towards establishing a unified entity with one voice that is  directed by our shared vision.   According to the Needs Analysis some of the identified strengths are as follows:  - Feedback to staff about their practices is being developed through the use of the Danielson rubric and this is seen as  a developing area of understanding for all.   - All members are working towards achieving the current instructional focus:   should be established within the next school year.     - School wide practices that are grade specific, which will be in consultation with their supervisor  According to the Needs Analysis some of the identified needs are as follows:  - Communication / roles clearly defined   - Entire staff of board – take ownership  - Follow through – monitor actions taking place  - Continuous support by administration  - Established teams with purpose and actions that are clear       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In an effort to recruit the best teachers, we have contacted some of the local universities. In turn, they recommend  candidates that have completed a degree program or are anticipating the completion of a degree program. In  addition, we receive a number of resumes via mail and e-mail. These resumes go through an initial screening based on  the specific license area in need. In order to ensure that teachers are highly qualified teachers, we only accept those  resumes that fit the specific license area in need and those candidates that possess the proper certification and  qualifying credentials. Once we have a pool of applicants, all candidates go through a rigorous selection and interview  process. Potential hires are brought in for an initial interview with a hiring committee that consists of, at minimum,  two (2) Assistant Principals. The Assistant Principals, who serve on the initial interview committee, possess an  expertise and/or experience in teaching or supervising the specific certification area being sought.   After the initial interview process, those candidates who advance are invited to the school to conduct a  demonstration lesson. They are asked to prepare for a literacy based lesson and are matched with the potential  grade(s) they will be servicing (should they be hired). Finally, the candidate participates in a final interview with our  hiring committee that consists of, at minimum, two (2) Assistant Principals. We discuss our professional expectations  for any of our potential staff members and ask that we be provided with at least three (3) references that we may  contact. Upon verifying the candidate’s prior work experience and professional conduct, we officially offer the  candidate the position. In order to retain current members of our school community, who are considered Highly  Qualified, we offer ongoing professional opportunities for growth and development.       2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   During the 2016-2017 School Year administrators, teachers, paraprofessionals, and staff will participate in  differentiated professional development (PDs) based on their needs/preferences. P.S. 143Q personnel will complete  different surveys throughout the year with a variety of professional development sessions for the personnel to choose  from. The list for possible PDs have been developed by the PD Committee compose by different grade teachers and  administration. Common Core Learning Standards, Quality Review, The Framework for Great Schools, Danielson  Framework for Teachers, the P.S. 143Q Needs Analysis and instructional focus were all considered in the design for  these PDs.    Some of the PDs include/will include:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37         Item Analysis to Drive Instruction       Whole Brain Learning: Keeping Students Engaged by Using Highly Interactive Form of Instruction.    Book Clubs for ELLs     Group Roles for Student Discussions    NYSESLAT for Grouping in GE Classes   Guided Reading with ENL and SE Support   Supporting Students with Autism   Literacy Learning Stations for ELLs     Questioning for Clusters    ENL Data for Planning and Grouping    Math Data for Planning    Questioning and Discussion for SWDs    Techniques for Grouping and Data for Clusters’      ENL Changes and Policy    Explicit Instruction      Questioning and Discussion Techniques    Read Alouds  Looking at IEPs Through SESIS      AMAO Tool for ENL Students    Using Excel - Intermediate    Using Technology in the classroom: SmartBoard, iPads     Using Excel for the Item Analysis to guide instruction    Paraprofessionals in the Classroom    Go Math Changes and using ThinkCentral to obtain data    Using Excel - Beginner     Engagement within the conditions of learning    These are just some of the examples of the ongoing professional development sessions our staff will engage in to help  meet the needs of our students and the expectations of Common Core Learning Standards.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38               Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  In the spring, prior to beginning Kindergarten, in order for students and parents to get accustomed to our off-site  Annex Building location, we host all registration appointments here. This includes NYSITELL Testing and meeting with  personnel that will be working with the children in September. In addition, we invite all incoming parents and  students for a Kindergarten Orientation. During our program, the teachers conduct a brief building tour and the  children visit a Kindergarten classroom. Teachers conduct a read aloud all about Kindergarten and children get to  explore Literacy Learning Stations and the many learning tools in a Kindergarten classroom. While the children are  visiting classrooms, we use this opportunity to meet with parents and review any essential information necessary for  a successful transition during the opening days of school. The agenda includes an introduction of our mandated  service providers, our Parent Coordinator, teachers and available support staff. Our School Nurse conducts a brief  overview of the necessary health forms along with our procedures for our students with asthma, allergies and any  chronic diseases. Finally, we discuss student bus procedures and the safety of our students as they ride a bus to/from  our off-site Annex location.   We also host school visits for children attending local pre-K programs. Staff members lead a tour the building with the  teachers and personnel from the local Pre-K facility together with the children.  In September, Opening Day is an early dismissal day for students. After children are dismissed, we invite our parents  and families in together with children for an additional Opening Day welcome event.       4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     During the 2016-2017 school year teachers and school staff will participate in two professional learning cycles (First  cycle begins- October 17, ends- January 28. Second cycle begins-February 6, ends- May 22). Each grade team will meet  every  Monday  to  discuss  student  performance  (weaknesses,  strengths),  analyze  data,  and  look  at  instructional  strategies to address Common Core Learning Standards in order to help support the needs of specific groups. The groups  would be determined after the learning cycle team works collaboratively in reviewing student work, chapter tests, pre  and post assessments, classroom observations, and homework. To give autonomy to each of the grade teams, the focus  for each of the cycles would be determined by each team. ENL teachers will participated in a learning cycle as a separate  team. Professional development will be provided by grade teams, and other teachers, i.e.: How to scaffold instruction  to support students, strategies to address specific skills. This will provide an opportunity to develop and tune an action  plan with the steps to be taken in order to achieve the specific goal.       After analyzing classroom data, deciding on subject, a focus group, and a Common Core Standard, the process is the  following:     Teachers will administered a prerequisite assessment to the focus group to determine the students' strengths   and weaknesses within a specific standard.      Teachers will implement one specific, researched strategy that will target student(s) weakness.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     Throughout the process teachers will gather information used to assess growth (mid and post assessments). In  addition, data could include student work and scores, classroom observations, and student feedback. Through  this process, teachers will share strong practices that have shown to work in their classroom as well as theories.                 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section: 5A, 5C, 5D,  6, 7    Section 5A, 5C, 6, 7     Section 5A, 5C, 6        Section 5A, 5C, 5D, 6     Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   1,058,554.00     303,688.00     94,604.00     0    9,532,158.00     X    X    X       X      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 143, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 143Q The Louis Armstrong Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42   Parental Involvement and School Quality      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

Our Reader’s Theater Morning Program (M-W, 6:55AM-7:55Am), which will target our  Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ENL students in grades K through 5 in both general and  special education, will begin in November. There will be one class per grade.  Each class will  have a ratio of a maximum of 10 ELLs or dual language English proficient students and 1  certified ENL teacher (10:1).  Teachers for the Reader’s Theater Morning Program, both ENL  certified teachers and content specialists (Arts/Technology), will provide direct instruction using  team teaching.  This will afford the students an opportunity to learn ENL strategies, as well as  creative arts techniques.  A majority of our Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ENL students  read below grade level based on the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Benchmark Assessments. In  addition, based on a breakdown of their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, they also need  support with their speaking and listening skills. The data from these two assessments will be  used to select students to attend this program.  Furthermore, a pre, a mid, and a post assessment  will be conducted focusing on the listening and speaking modalities.  These assessments will be  use to determine the students’ progress and drive instructional decisions throughout the  program.  A rubric will be used to assess their performance of their skit.  Reader's theater is a  method of reading a story aloud, like a play, without memorization, props, or a stage. Students  are each assigned a character role and read their parts with expression, meaning and  enthusiasm.  Dramatic oral reading in a role-play reading format has proven to improve reading  skills in a fun and engaging way.  We will be purchasing Reader’s Theater from Santillana. This  program targets students who need support in developing their listening, speaking, and reading  skills with a focus on comprehension. It also incorporates visual cues that target vocabulary  development geared toward ELLs. Six ENL Teachers and teachers with Arts experience (i.e.  Theatre Cluster teacher, Visual Arts/Technology teacher) will motivate the students to interact  using their oral, visual and auditory skill to acquire English language skills.  Our Saturday Program (7:45AM-11AM) will be in November, for grades 1-5 and will target our  Transitioning and Expanding ENL and Dual Language students. English Proficient (EP) students  from our dual language classes will also be invited. There will be one class per grade with fifteen  students per class.  Students in the Saturday Program will not be the same as those in the  morning program.  Spotlight on English from Santillana will only be used as supplemental  material for the Saturday program.  It will not be used during the regular school day.  This  program will target writing, as this has been identified as a need based on our ELL students'  performance on both the writing portion of the NYSESLAT and their ELA scores.  Six ENL  Teachers, Bilingual Education Teachers, and/or Dual Language teachers will use Spotlight on  English, also from Santillana. Grade appropriate classroom sets will be purchased for each class.  This program supports students in developing the writing process and giving them targeted  strategies to guide their independent writing. This breakdown is based on the number of students  who need writing and ELA support.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Another Saturday program (7:45AM-11AM),  STEM for ELLs-Building Bridges by Building  Bikes will also be offered. This class will allow 25 ELLs (primarily Special Education ELLs)  and English Proficient (EP) dual language students,in grades 3-5, to take part in the hands-on  design and engineering principles of bicycles.  This enrichment program will use ENL strategies  to incorporate the four disciplines of STEM education (science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics) which are very necessary for our children to be able to compete in today’s  increasingly competitive global marketplace. In this program, students will be putting the  academic skills they have learned in various classes towards the engineering of  a functional  bicycle.  Our school is just a few blocks from Flushing Meadows Park, which will allow us to  take a day trip to ride our bikes and learn about bicycle safety as our culminating event. This  program will provide students with a strong and positive formative experience, one that will  allow them to understand the practical value of the skills we teach in the classroom, and one that  may guide them towards meaningful and productive academic pursuits and careers. The ENL  Teacher and Science Teacher should have basic knowledge of bicycle engineering.  Title III  funds would be used to purchase the tools necessary for proper bicycle maintenance.      Our After School Newcomers program (2:30PM-4:15PM, W-Th) will target newcomers to our  school for less than one year.  We aim to have 3 classes of 15 students each both taught by ENL  certified teachers with familiarity with either Spanish and/or Chinese. The program will span  from October to January, using the Santillana Spotlight on English, Newcomer Handbook. The  program utilizes dictionaries, photo cards, audio CDs, and other supplemental resources to  provide scaffolds in reading, writing, speaking, and listening across all content areas. One class  will target grades K, one class will target 1-2; one class will target grades 3-5.  New students  admitted to the school will immediately be invited to the program through rolling admissions  through the end of the program.      For all three programs, 20% of the total Title III monies will be used to purchase laptops  (OTPS) for use with Lexia, an online literacy program funded by District 24.  Usage of the  laptops will be used daily during the Title III instructional programs.  Lexia has an assessment  system that provides progress monitoring as well as reports that both the Title III teachers and  classroom teachers can access.  Data from the assessments will be used to provide personalized  online instruction and  individualized/small group instruction lessons for the Title III teacher and  classroom teacher.        Records including agendas, attendance sheets and invitations in the parent’s preferred  language will be kept in a separate binder by the Principal's Secretary in the general office.  The  ENL Coordinator will also keep a copy of these documents.     rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:               P.S. 143Q is a very large school of approximately 1,700 students, with an ELL population  52%.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess our ELLs early literacy skills, we begin with our Fundations Inventory and the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Assessment. The Fundations Inventory Assessment data provides us with concept of print and letter recognition information.  Based on the Fundations Inventory Assessment we know:  •   44% of our Kindergarten ELL students are able to recognize their uppercase letters  •   42% of our Kindergarten ELL students are able to recognize their lowercase letters  •   18% of our Kindergarten ELL students are able to recognize their sounds  •   94% of our First Grade ELL students are able to recognize their uppercase letters  •   94% of our First Grade ELL students are able to recognize their lowercase letters  •   81% of our First Grade ELL students are able to recognize 81% of their sounds  •   84% of our Second Grade ELL students are able to recognize their uppercase letters   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      •   85% of our Second Grade ELL students are able to recognize their lowercase letters  •   88% of our Second Grade ELL students are able to recognize their sounds  This data provides our K - 2 grade teachers with specific information on the needs of our ELL students. This information also  provides our ENL providers with literacy information to guide their programs for our ELL students. We are currently  administering the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment. This assessment will provide us with each student’s reading  level. The running record focuses on the student’s accuracy, fluency, comprehension and writing skills. This information will  help guide our teachers’ instruction and our ENL providers will be able to select an appropriate program to guide their  students.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At P.S. 143Q we have many structures to support this effort.  One of the structures is curriculum mapping which utilizes a  standards-based approach.  Another structure that supports this effort is our ENL data analysis meetings.  In addition, ENL, and  other providers attend common planning meetings with the classroom teachers.  Furthermore, we have inquiry analysis teams  that analyze data and create focus groups of students to target their needs as an additional support.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ENL Program (DL and Free Standing ENL) is evaluated by reviewing the data collected by using a variety of  formal and informal assessments.  The formal assessments include the following: NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, El Sol, ELE, NYS ELA,  NYS Math, and NYS Science.  Informal assessments include but are not limited to the following: ELL Interim Assessments,  conference notes in the different content areas, running records, on demand ENL writing assessments, and teacher  observations.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Literacy and/or Math.  Inquiry is used to focus on students who need targeted instruction in the four ENL modalities (L, S, R &  W).  Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) is used to address students who do not meet grade-level benchmarks in reading.  In  each of these interventions, small group instruction, as weil as one-on-one conferences are used to support students.  Imagine  Learning is used for our ELLs as needed, especially for our newcomers and Entering students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   From our Fountas & Pinnell and other various assessments teachers decide if an ELL student may need to be in RTI. The  classroom teacher will provide the ELL students with the necessary scaffolds for Tier 1. If the child does not show any progress  the student is recommended to Tier 2. In Tier 2 the RTI provider will provide the student with intensive small group  instruction. This instruction could be tailored to meet the students phonics or literacy comprehension level based on the data  collected. If the child does not show any progress in Tier 2 they will be recommended for Tier 3. During tier 3 the students will  be provided with a small group intensive environment with the RTI/AIS  teacher. To see if a student has made progress, we will  re-administer the Fountas and Pinnell running record to gather updated information to help further guide instruction.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns with regards to the ELL students’ NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores across proficiency levels and grades show  distinct patterns and fluctuations.  Data for grades K show that 56% of ELL students’ proficiency level is Entering .  25% of  Kindergarten students score at the Emerging and Transitioning levels and 19% of Kindergarteners are at the Expanding  level.  This shows more than half of incoming ELLs scoring at the Entering level with an almost even number of ELLs at the  Emerging, Transitioning or Expanding levels. By first grade there is a significant shift in ELLs proficiency levels with only 18%  scoring at the Entering level, 48% scoring at the Emerging and Transitioning levels and 34% scoring at the Expanding level. This  indicates that a large number of ELLs are increasing their English proficiency from Kindergarten to first grade.   The second  grade ELLs scores reflect 21% scoring at the Entering level, 58% scoring at the Emerging and Transitioning  level, and 20%  scoring at the Expanding  level.  This data shows that there is a lot less movement across proficiency levels from first and  second grade than from kindergarten to first grade.     The third grade ELLs scores show 16% scoring at the Entering level, 31%   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         scoring at the Emerging and Transitioning level, and 52% scoring at the Expanding level.   This data shows significant  movement from the Emerging and Transitioning levels to the Expanding level and minimal movement from the Entering to the  Emerging or Transitioning  levels from second to third grade.  The fourth grade ELLs scores show 23% scoring at the  Entering  level, 43% scoring at the Emerging or Transitioning  level, and 34% scoring at the Expanding level.  This seems to  indicate movement from the Entering to Emerging or Transitioning  levels, but it also seems that less students are moving into  the Expanding level from third to fourth grade .  The ENL fifth grade students’ scores reflect 25% scoring Entering level, 36% at  the  Emerging and Transitioning levels, and 39% scoring at the Expanding level.  This indicates less movement from fourth to  fifth grades across proficiency levels.  It may also be noted that while a majority of ELLs scored at the Expanding level in third  grade showing significant movement toward English proficiency, that pattern is not maintained in the upper grades (fourth  and fifth).       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   There are many structures that we use to disseminate these findings and make adjustments to our programs.  We have ENL  data analysis meetings throughout the school year to analyze and discuss strategies and share best practices in regard to ENL  instruction.  We also analyze the ENL data and determine trends.  We then collaborate with each other to discuss how we  could meet the needs of our ELLs, build on their academic strengths, and address their academic gaps.  We share these  findings with the classroom teachers during common planning sessions.  The classroom teachers can then use this data to  implement the suggested strategies and monitor student progress.  In addition, the ENL Team meets once a week to identify  specific students who are not making adequate progress, and discuss strategies to implement that will help to address their  specific needs.  As part of the inquiry process, we track our inquiry/focus students in a specific modality along with the CCLS to  help students achieve mastery of grade-level standards.  Information is also shared through grade-level ENL workshops for  classroom teachers.  We hold monthly parent meetings to discuss ENL data and provide parents with strategies to help their  children at home.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           Our freestanding ENL (English as a New Language) program delivers instruction to ELLs (English Language  Learners) in two different formats; ENL Push in/Co-teaching; and Self -Contained ENL Classes.  The ELL students  serviced by the ENL Push-in/Co-teaching model receive instruction for the mandated units of study  according to their  proficiency level through a collaborative co-teaching approach where the classroom teacher and ENL teacher provider  integrate ENL strategies in English Language Arts (ELA),  and content area instruction.  in addition, the ENL teacher  provides stand alone ENL instruction for Entering and Emergent students.   The ELL students serviced in the ENL self  contained classroom setting receive all instruction by a dually certified (Common Branch and ESL)  classroom  teacher.  This classroom teacher is responsible for delivering instruction for the mandated units of study according to  students’ proficiency levels, as well as  providing stand alone ENL instruction for Entering and Emergent students. In  this format, the teacher provides ENL strategies throughout the instructional day in the various content areas.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.         Currently we have three Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE)  (Spanish) classes . These are 12:1:1 Special  Education classes in Kindergarten, 1st Grade, and 2nd grade.   The students in TBE transfer home language skills to  English from Spanish.  Students receive 75% of instruction in Spanish and 25% instruction in English at the beginning  of the as the year . As the year progresses and the students become more proficient in English the percentage of  instruction in Spanish decreases as the English instruction increases.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Instruction is also differentiated for individual students according to their ELL level. For example the ratio of home  language to English for  Entering students is 75/25; for Emerging students is 60/40; for Transitioning students is50/50;  and for Expanding students is 25/75.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      DL (Dual Language) General Ed Classes consist of two classes on each grade. The teachers employ a side by side model  where both classes on the grade switch every other day between Spanish and English. The Spanish instruction is  delivered by a certified Bilingual Common Branch Spanish teacher and the English instruction is provided by a certified  Common Branch teacher. Both groups could either have 50% ELLs and 50% Non-ELLs or one group could be entirely  non ELLs and the other group for have ELLs. The ELLs in the Dual Language Program are Spanish speaking students or  English and who scored at a Transitioning to Commanding level on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL. These students are also  serviced by the ENL Push-in/Co-teaching model. They also receive instruction for the mandated hours and units of  study according to their proficiency level through a collaborative co-teaching approach. The classroom teacher and  ENL provider integrate ENL strategies aligned with the Bilingual Common Core Progressions in the content area and in  addition provide stand alone ENL instruction for Entering and Emergent students. The remainder of the students is  made up of Non-ELLs whose parents have expressed a desire for them to achieve proficiency in both languages.  The  non-ELLs can be from Spanish speaking homes, or from homes where English or another language is spoken primarily.  In this program students are emerged in instruction that supports their native culture.     Our DL ICT (Integrated Co-Teaching) Classes consist of one class for grades K-2. Spanish and English instruction is  delivered by two certified Bilingual Common Branch Spanish teachers. One of the teachers also holds certification in  Special Education. The teachers provide their ELL group with the strategies, the scaffolds needed, the mandated hours  and units of study according to their proficiency level through a collaborative co-teaching approach. The classes  consist of about 30 students in which there is a maximum of 12 for students with an IEP (Individualized Educational  Plan) who are also ELLs. The remainder of the class consists of non-ELLs from Spanish speaking homes,or from homes  where English or another language is spoken primarily. In this program students are emerged in instruction that  supports their native culture.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Classroom and ENL Provider schedules are aligned to meet the mandated hours based on individual students NYSESLAT and  NYSITELL performance.  Administrators engage in ongoing yearlong recruitment based on availability of candidates holding proper certification.  A  Hiring Committee is then called upon to interview and recommend the best possible candidate.  Classroom teacher and/or ENL providers follow the mandated times assigned to each student according to their level of  proficiency.  Students in ENL and DL classes who scored at the Entering  level on the NYSESLAT receive the required 180 minutes standalone  ENL per week and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA per week. Students in ENL and DL classes who scored at the Emerging  level on the NYSESLAT receive the required 90 minutes standalone ENL per week, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA per  week, and the required 90 minutes in another content area instruction per week. Students in the ENL and DL classes who  scored at the Transitioning level on the NYSESLAT are not required to receive minutes for standalone ENL per week, but  receive the required 90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA per week, and required 90 minutes in another content area instruction  per week. Students in ENL and DL classes who scored at the Expanding level on the NYSESLAT are not required to receive  minutes for standalone ENL per week in standalone and receive 180 minutes per week of ENL/ELA or other content area.  Students in freestanding ENL programs and in DL classes who scored at the Commanding level on the NYSESLAT are not  required to receive minutes for standalone ENL per week, but receive a minimum of 90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA or other  content area.  Students in ENL and DL classes that scored at the Commanding Level on the NYSESLAT are mandated to receive  an additional  two years of ENL support.     HLA (Home Language Arts) instructional minutes are delivered to only DL and TBE classes. In DL classes students receive 50%   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      of the yearly instruction in the HLA and 50% of the yearly instruction in English. Both literacy and content are taught equally in  both Spanish and English over the course of the program. Instruction is delivered in one language at a time without  translation. Our DL program extends from grades K-5. Our DL ICT program extends from grades K-2.     Our TBE program extends from grades K-2. All the students in the program share the same home language (Spanish). As  students (all ELLs) develop English language skills, time in the home language decreases. Students who scored at the Entering  level on the NYSESLAT receive 75% of instruction in the home language and 25% in English. Students who scored at the  Emerging level on the NYSESLAT receive 60% of instruction in the home language and 40% in English. Students who scared at  the Transitioning level on the NYSESLAT receive 50% of instruction in the home language and 50% in English. Students who  scored at the Expanding level on the NYSESLAT receive 25% in the home language and 75% in English.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    Content area instruction is delivered in compliance with the legislative mandates and directives for each ELL program as  described in CR Part 154. Dual language students received content area instruction in both English and Spanish.     Kindergarten students in Dual language receive one 45-minute period each week of Science and Social Studies as do student  students in first, second and third grades. Instructional language varies with a side by side model of English and Spanish on a  daily basis. Math and literacy instruction in Dual Language classes likewise varies with alternating patterns of English and  Spanish where students are instructed also using the ReadyGen Pathways and Go Math programs. Students receive ten 45- minutes periods of literacy per week and ten 45-minute periods per week of math. Cluster teachers instruct students who  receive one 45-minute period each week of Science and one 45-minute period each week of Social Studies. Also, students  receive one period of Science and of Social Studies each week taught by the classroom teacher using the side by side method.  Science and Social Studies instructional time allocation each week conforms to CR Part 154 requirements.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    PS 143 ELL students are evaluated in Social Studies and Science in their native language for unit exams and state exams as the  ELL students are transitioning from their native language to English. ELLs in the DL program are also assessed once a year  though the ELE State Exam. Our Dual Language  ELL students are also evaluated in literacy with running records in their native  language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Currently, we have no SIFE students. However, AIS programs and interventions are available should any SIFE students be  enrolled throughout the school year. In addition, teachers would implement other strategies to help these students move  forward such as establishing partnerships in the classrooms. Flexible and differentiated groupings could be established to meet  these students' needs . ENL and AIS teachers could push-in to provide additional support for these students. At-risk counseling  would be provided by our Guidance Counselor, Intervention Specialist and Parent Coordinator.  b. Newcomers with less than three years in the U.S. are generally placed in a push-in program or a self-contained ESL class at  the parent's request. We are using the On Our Way to English program; this program offers an intensive guided reading  program for newcomers. The ENL providers and classroom teachers will utilize these programs to help our newcomer  students. Newcomers have access to books in their native language. They also use glossaries, word to word dictionaries,  translated computer software, picture dictionaries and multicultural text. They are further supported through partnership and  buddy systems.  c. AIS services including remedial reading programs such as Wilson, Words Their Way, Fundations, Reading System, and  Imagine Learning for ELLs who have been receiving services for four to six years. In addition, these students are invited and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      encouraged to attend all remedial ELA and Math Before and After School Programs as well as Saturday Academy programs.  d. Currently, we have no long term ELLs (over six years). However, if any were to arrive during the school year, we have AIS  teachers in place to provide intensive remedial support using a variety of programs. In addition, these students would be  invited and encouraged to attend all remedial ELA and Math before and after school programs as well as Saturday Academy  programs.  e. Former ELLs are invited to all the programs that are ELL students are involved in.  Former ELLs are identified and assessed  carefully to make sure that they get continued support if they require it. ENL providers make room in their schedule to provide  support to for former ELLs.  Testing accommodations are made for former ELLs along with current ELLs accordingly.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELL - SWD will use the ReadyGen and GoMath programs. Both programs provide scaffolds for ELLs and SWD. Our ENL  providers will use On Our Way to English guided reading program for their push in/pull out small group instruction. Our Self- Contained classes will be provided with On Our Way to English whole group program to the entire class throughout the  week.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The special education team meets to discuss the present levels of performance for each student who has an IEP.  Based on the  child's performance, a flexible program is used throughout the day, so the student could participate in the General Ed  curriculum alongside their general education peers.  This consists of students in multiple settings throughout the day, ie. 12:1:1  for math and ICT for ELA.  In addition, our SWD ELLs are invited to participate in our afterschool S.T.E.M. Bicycle Mechanics  program.  This provides these students with the opportunity to build language and hands-on activity.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  To provide support and strengthen instruction for our ELL population, we have implemented the following programs: The  morning program focusing on reading and language acquisition, Extended Day Program focusing on language development  acquisition through literacy, Saturday Program focusing on math, language development and acquisition through the use of  literacy. Additional support is provided by push-in ESL/AIS teachers. The following technology programs are utilized: Imagine  Learning (English, Spanish, Chinese) and RAZ-Kids reading program..     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Morning and after school programs will be continued for the upcoming school year.  Programs used include On Our Way to  English (Regular School),  Journeys (Morning Program), and Write Traits (Saturday Program) as detailed in our TItle III.   ENL  push-in teachers will be servicing classroom teachers multiple times a week to include both stand alone (On Our Way To  English) ENL and integrated ENL/content area instruction (Go Math, etc.)         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently, we are not discontinuing  any programs and/or services.  Note that due to construction on Saturdays, there will not  be any Saturday Programs in the building 2015-2016.  The programs used for Saturday Program will be scheduled for morning  and/or after school times.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All school programs offered to non-ELL students are also offered to ELL students. These include Saturday ELL Academy, Before  and After School Remedial Programs, Enrichment Programs such as Theater/Drama, Art, Music, Dance, Dance Festival, and The  Casa Theatre group, which are afforded to the entire school population.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      To provide support and strengthen instruction for our ELL population, we have implemented the following programs: The  morning program will focus on reading and language acquisition through Reader’s Theatre for our Entering and Emerging ELLs,  After School/Saturday Program will focus on language development acquisition through literacy for our Transitioning and  Expanding ELLs (Write Traits and MOEMs, respectively).  Additional support is provided by push-in ENL/RTI teachers. The  following technology programs are utilized for all ELLs: Imagine Learning (English, Spanish, Chinese) and RAZ-KIDS reading.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our Dual Language classes will serve both ELL students in need of English language development and English-proficient  students who are interested in learning and/or improving the target language (Spanish). Our program is designed to continue  developing students’ home language, as well as English skills while supporting English-proficient students in learning Spanish.  Through their interactions and language support, each group will provide a role model for language development.      The Dual Language model adapted by our school is the side-by-side, alternating-day in which the students will receive 50% of  their instructional time in one room with a Spanish language immersion teacher who will only use the target language. The  remaining part of the instructional time will be with a teacher who instructs only in English in another room. Our teachers  generally teach exclusively in one language to two groups of students. Language is taught through content areas as well as  through literacy (Go Math and ReadyGen Curriculums are taught in English and Spanish). The goal of our program is to develop  grade-level-appropriate, bilingual, biliterate and bicultural academic skills in both English and Spanish for all students.    Native language support may be given in Free Standing ENL programs in a variety of ways. Native language libraries and  textbooks are available for ELLs who require their support. Technology based programs such as Imagine Learning and RAZ-KIDS  also offer native language support. In addition, classroom and support teachers may give native language support to individual  students on a case by case basis.    ENL services are provided through self contained ENL classes and push in models.  Home language support is provided based  on students needs in both models.  Imagine Learning (computer based program) and Estrellita (phonics program in native  language) are programs used to support the home language to these students.  Materials are provided to students in their  home language as needed.  The Go Math program has materials available in home language.  In regard to ReadyGen,  supplemental materials are used in students home language as needed.  Additionally, in all ENL programs, native language  supports such as the use of cognates are employed to help build on the ELLs native language and make connections to English  language vocabulary.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required support services and resources for ELLs are determined according to the individual students’ grade and ability as  indicated by their NYSESLAT results. AIS providers also support students according to their individual needs. Student peers  provide assistance to students who speak the same language when possible     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    n/a     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Parents and newly enrolled Kindergarten students are invited to attend a Kindergarten Orientation before the beginning of the  school year. The goal of this program is for parents and students to become familiar with the school and teachers.   In addition,  newly enrolled ELLs and their parents are invited to a parent selection meeting to become familiar with the program options  and ENL staff members.  Throughout the school year, parents are invited to attend parent ENL/NYSESLAT information sessions  and meet with their children’s ENL providers.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a) EPs and ELLs will receive the same amount of instructional time in the target language based on the  side-by- side model of instruction of the Dual Language classes. The language used for instruction is  broken down by a 50/50 ratio. Fifty percent of classroom instruction is provided in English and fifty  percent of classroom instruction is provided in Spanish. Content and literacy instruction are provided to  all students in both languages.    b) EPs and ELLs are integrated throughout the entire school day and year. All content areas are integrated  within the daily instruction schedule so that EPs and ELLs are acquiring academic and social languages in  both simultaneously.     c) In the side-by-side model, two groups of students receive instruction from two teachers – a Bilingual  (Spanish) teacher and a common branch teacher. Each class alternates teachers and classrooms who use  a specific language of instruction for the entire school day. For example, group A will receive instruction  in English from the English language teachers in his/her classroom while group B will receive instruction  in Spanish from the Spanish language teacher in his/her room. The next day, group A and B will switch.  Through this model, each group alternates English and Spanish days. All content areas are taught in both  languages on alternate days.    d) In the side-by-side Dual Language model used in our school both languages are taught simultaneously  to each class from Kindergarten to Fifth Grade.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is an ongoing endeavor for all ELL personnel and is provided throughout the school year by district  officials, the Principal, Assistant Principals, Coaches and other ENL teachers.  ENL teachers attend professional development  provided by the OLL, NYS Spanish BETAC, Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL), Hunter College.  Professional development is  also provided in-house during Faculty Conferences, Grade Conferences, and Professional Development time (Mondays). For  every professional development, agendas and sign-in sheets are kept in a file. The Bilingual ESL Coach attends bi-weekly PD  sessions offered by the network on Common Core learning standards, working with SIFE students, how to identify ELLs, RTI,  complex and frustration-level texts, and bilingual common core progression.  Subsequently, The Bilingual ESL Coach turnkeys  this information to ENL and DL teachers at weekly meetings.  Teachers of ELLs are currently using On Our Way to English, which is a new program for ELLs in K-5.  It is aligned with the  Common Core Learning Standards. This program provides ongoing support throughout the year.  In addition, ReadyGen and Go   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         Math have sections designed to support the ELLs.  The ENL Coach also provides professional development to align current  programs to the CCLS.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance department provides orientation for our ELLs who are being promoted to middle school. Depending on the  needs of individual students, guidance personnel will provide private counseling to students being promoted to middle school.  Our bilingual Guidance Counselor does parent outreach throughout the school year to aid families with this transition. The  Parent Coordinator also gives workshops on school choices available to children.  All staff receive 7.5 hours of ELL training during the current school year from in-house and from outside organizations such as  New York University, Museum of Modern Art and SBETAC. Teachers provide agendas and literature that were obtained at  these workshops. Records of this training are maintained by the Bilingual ENL Coach.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   A schedule will be made to meet parents after school on the parent involvement time allotted for Tuesdays.     2. Parents will be sent letters of appointment for these meetings and a signed record of matters discussed will be kept on file  with the Bil./ENL Coach.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      The Parent Coordinator acts as a liaison to community-based organizations servicing the parents of P.S. 143 including ELL  parents of current and former ELLs. The Parent Coordinator provides the Family Literacy Program to strengthen parents  abilities to support their children as they experience the school’s curriculum in their own learning. The school nurse  coordinates workshops addressing health issues of students such as dental hygiene, flu prevention, asthma, eye care and other  issues.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jerry Brito, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

Yes/No    Jorge        Silva   Bilingual/ENL Coach   Yes   Yes     * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon arrival at our school to register a child, parents are required to complete a Home Language Identification  Survey (HLIS) to determine the languages spoken in the home. On this form a parent may indicate the language  that they would prefer to communicate in, both orally and through written correspondence. This information is  input into ATS under the RCPL page. The HLIS is available in a number of languages, so parents can complete it in  their preferred language. An oral interview is also administered by the Bilingual/ENL Coordinator, Jorge Silva, or  other trained certified bilingual pedagogues in either Spanish or English. If an interview in Mandarin is required,  ENL teacher Dan Dan Lin is able to do so. If translation services are required in another language, we enlist the aid  of the DOE Translation/Interpretation unit to translate by means of a telephone conference call. Translation and  interpretation needs are also assessed during the ELL parent orientation meeting and beginning of the year PTA  meetings. The Parent Coordinator, Jessica Malaga, or the Bilingual/ESL Coach, Jorge Silva, will then communicate  these needs to the administration and to the school community.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

School emergency cards are used and in house Spanish aides or teachers interpret. If Chinese speaking staff is  available they will interpret, otherwise school translation line is utilized. The school also has School Messenger to sent  out text messages to parents in English and Spanish.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.
