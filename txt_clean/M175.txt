This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S. 175 is to provide a safe and supportive environment where students flourish and receive a high- quality differentiated educational experience that meets the needs of all students and allows them to excel. As a  community of learners, P.S. 175 believes that children learn best when engaged in hands-on, project based, complex  learning tasks that involve students in design, problem-solving, decision making , and investigative activities all tied  into authentic projects to provide deeper levels of understanding while providing alignment to academic standards.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   To meet the needs of the students and families, P.S. 175 has strategic partnerships to promote academic success and  well-being of every student. These collaborations and initiatives the Morgan Library and Museum Book Project,  Reading Partners, Inside Broadway, Columbia University Division I Athletic Teams, Uncommon Impact Guided  Reading, Algebra for All, New York City Teaching Fellows Collaborative, student teaching partnership with City College,  NYPD 32nd Precinct, Carmel Hill Literacy Inc., Harlem Figure Skating, NY Cares Winter Wishes, Face Lab Robotics and  Advanced Robotics, New York Cares Corporate Volunteer Programs, Sanford Harmony Social-Emotional Learning  Program, Winter Coats for Students, Anti-Defamation League, the DOE Software Engineering Program for elementary  schools (SEPjr.) (one of only 23 schools in the DOE), Restorative Practices, Respect for All, Anti-Defamation League No  Place for Hate, Anti-bullying Walk-a-thon completed by entire school, PBIS, and New York City Teaching Academy  Fellowship Collaborative. P.S. 175 was recognized as a DOE Respect for All School the past two school years, received  a Gold Award for Health and Wellness, and won the New York City Elementary Basketball League championship.   The strengths and accomplishments of P.S. 175 include several new collaborative models that involve administrators,  educators, and parents which have increased our family-community ties; recognizing and celebrating excellent  teaching practices; increased professional development for educators; full-day kindergarten; initiatives to  communicate with parents including a Twitter account and an active website where homework is published each  week; and a continued school-wide focus on hands-on science that includes participation in STEM, SEPjr., and  robotics. These collaborative models include a designated time for professional development of teaching practices, a  committee and structured planning time by the teachers of students with disabilities to improve the quality of IEPs  and compliance, a committee to strategically develop and implement new positive behavior expectations and a  school-wide approach to the learning environment, a designated time to collect and track behaviors and correct  implementation of Behavior Intervention Plans, participation in the DOE Restorative Practices activities, and the  additional focus of the school leadership team to develop additional collaborative opportunities for parents,  educators, and students. Some of these included Make & Take academic resource events for parents, Coffee with the  Principal, class publishing parties at the end of each writing unit, evening Maker Fairs, and pot-luck family dinners.   Excellent teaching practices and successes are celebrated and communicated to the entire community through a  designated bulletin board and weekly staff newsletter. An increased focus on professional development includes  weekly planned professional development for the staff, outside professional development days for the entire staff,  inter-visitations, and targeted professional develop for specific academic areas and needs. New initiatives to  communicate with parents include planned parent workshops, individual class monthly parent newsletters, an  evening science fair, weekly planned interaction with the Parent Coordinator through scheduled Tea activities, pre- kindergarten monthly developmental calendars to support and increase parent involvement and a variety of  communication practices by the parent coordinator and teachers including print and digital. The school-wide focus on  science has culminated in “Science Fridays” when all students in all classes focus on hands-on science investigation  and learning at the start of the school-day and parents are always welcome to be active participants. Robotics and  student computer coding became an integral part of Science Fridays during the 2017-18 school year.   While the school is making positive strides in a variety of critical areas, P.S. 175 is focused on meeting the challenge of  developing and implementing system-wide accountability. One measure implemented is the increased use of Stars  Early Literacy, Stars Reading, and Stars math assessments, curriculum unit culminating final projects, and progress  monitoring to provide more in-depth data to aid teachers in data-driven instruction to support students. P.S. 175  continues to strive to improve teacher pedagogy, including consistency in all classrooms, as per Quality Review  Indicator 1.2 to continue to make measurable academic progress and student achievement gains as we provide equity  in education while meeting the specific needs of all learners including ELLs and SWD.         3.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  In order to assist our youngest student’s transition into kindergarten, support is provided to both students and  families. We utilize the Explore curriculum, allowing students to develop their early literacy and math skills with a  focus on learning beginning reading skills and number sense. Students who are identified as at-risk through  developmental assessments will receiving additional support. Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten students utilize the  same play yard, and have the same dismissal procedures to help students make the transition. Pre-K students have a  staggered opening to school to allow families to be involved in the orientation of the classroom with their students. In  addition, during the spring of each year additional parent workshops are provided to help parents of Pre-K students  understand expectations and differences for kindergarten. PS 175 helps students with this transition by intentionally  taking Pre-K students to the lunch room to teach kindergarten-grade 5 procedures and begins to shorten nap times to  allow students to experience a day of school without a nap--as will be the expectation in kindergarten.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     In the spring of 2018, all teachers were involved in the process of selecting the school's ELA and math curriculum— including determination to continue with current curriculum in various subjects.To aid the teachers, a series of  professional development was provided by the administration, grade coordinators, and outside consultants. A  committee of teachers then met with administrators to form our curriculum mapping and assessment team. This  group was responsible for researching different assessments and make decisions on the assessment choices that  would be most relevant for our population of students. Throughout the year, all other teachers receive training in  understanding the components of the assessment, how to modify their curriculum, and implement strategies related  to the assessment measures.           4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   The overall aim of this policy is to continue to build upon a parent involvement program that will ensure effective  involvement of parents and community in the school. PS 175, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      --The school will involve the parents of children served in Title 1; Part A programs in decisions about how the 1  percent of Title 1, Part A funds reserved for parental involvement is spent.

The primary focus of this program is  to develop English literacy and written skills that will increase academic achievement and  English language acquisition across all content areas, and with the goal of achieving success  through academic vocabulary acquisition, fluency, and comprehension.   Newcomer and developing English language learners in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4; whose English  proficiency levels are at emerging, transitioning, and expanding, based on the New York State  English as a Second Language Achievement Test, are the students to be served in this Title III  Program. There will be 30 English language learners from grades 1 through 4 that will be  provided ENL supplemental services. This after-school program, which focuses on academic  content enhancement, will be implemented every Wednesday and Thursday. The program will  begin at 2:30 pm and will end at 4:30 pm. The program will kick off on November 28, 2018 and  will culminate on April 11, 2019. English is the language of instruction. One certified ENL  teacher and one certified content area teacher will provide direct instruction for these ELL  subgroups through flexible grouping. There are 36 total number of sessions starting on  November 28, 2018 and ending on March 16, April 11, 2019. Each session lasts for two hours.  An administrative staff will be supervising the Title III program as well as other after-school  programs. Both teachers, ENL teacher and content area teacher have a group. Each teacher will  provide direct instruction for an hour with a group and switch group in the next hour.  The 1st and 2nd grade group will use English Now materials and Language Proficiency (Readers  for Writers) materials for 3rd and 4th grade group. Both materials cover topics on different  specific content areas such as science, math, and social studies, and highlight specific aspects of  the reading and writing process and provide auditory and visual practice. These materials are  specially designed for language learners who are acquiring proficiency in English specifically at  the emerging and transitioning levels. The four modalities are incorporated in these materials. In  listening and reading, students can acquire academic and content vocabulary, negotiate meaning,  and respond to minimal pairs, rhythm and intonation. In speaking, students can transform  sentences from simple to elaborated, detect and correct own grammatical errors, orally compose  own stories, and retell a story. In writing, students can write their own stories, detect and correct  own mechanical errors.The materials are already on site and part of the school inventory. The  materials that are used in the program are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily  instruction. These materials are specifically intended to be used in the Title III program.

The assessment tools that the school uses include:     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   These assessments are used to help teachers determine the progress in literacy development in children from grades  kindergarten through 5. These assessments measures speaking, listening, decoding, vocabulary,  fluency, and comprehension  skills of students including English Language Learners. These are used in determining students' developmental reading levels  for the purpose of planning instruction and documenting reading growth or progress. ENL teacher and classroom teachers  meet during Teacher Team meeting.  They look at data and collaborate to analyze data to determine their needs. During   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Teacher Team meetings, classroom teachers and ENL teacher collaborate, prepare or share lesson plans and strategies that  will be incorporated in the lesson.     3.

The summative assessments  that the school uses include:     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school looks at the standardized test results to check whether the English Language Learners met the annual yearly  progress and determine whether English Language Learners make improvement or score proficient or commanding on  NYSESLAT using the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT). The school analyzes and translates the data in creating and forming  effective instructional groups and in differentiating instruction during small group instruction.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school uses data to guide instruction that would focus on promoting language and literacy development, one that targets  the student population's needs on a daily basis as part of a long-term plan. Instruction that builds interventions and will serve  as truly supplemental and supportive. Instruction that will focus specifically on developing different key domains of literacy, to  support competencies in reading, writing, listening, and speaking and most of all instruction that makes direct and appropriate  connections to ELLs' community values, identities and languages.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The school uses the NYSESLAT, ELA and math scores to evaluate and inform ELL program. The school uses EDAT and its filtering  functions to dig into the data to see specific needs and strengths of each English language learner.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The school uses the ELL Data Analysis Tool in forming and creating effective instructional groups to differentiate instruction.  The students are grouped based on the modalities of strength and modalities of need.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a  dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area  teacher. Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language  development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a  minimum number of units of integrated ENL. Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that  students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  In our school we both use stand-alone and integrated ENL models. Students  are grouped according to mixed  proficiency levels.      b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                    The school provides the mandated number of instructional minutes according to proficiency levels to our English  language learners. Our school uses Freestanding ENL program model. English language learners in Freestanding ENL program  receive all instruction in English with home language support. The number of ENL instructional units that a student receives is  regulated by the New York State CR Part 154 regulations and determined by student English proficiency levels as determined  by the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners ( NYSITELL) and NYSESLAT scores.   Most of our ELLs receive integrated ENL in ELA  and other classes receive integrated ENL  in both ELA and science or social  studies.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our school uses both stand-alone and integrated ENL models. English is the language of instruction.  Small group instruction  and stations are the instructional approaches used.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?             Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are given to students at beginning of the year, and used throughout school year as  well as on all classrooms and state exams. The school orders test materials in the student's alternative language. For state  examinations for which State Education Department provides written translations, English Language Learners may use  both  English and an alternative language edition of the test simultaneously. School provides  ELL students with an oral  translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by State Education Department. All translations  must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. ELLs have the opportunity to summarize the book or books that they  read in English. ELLs work in small groups according to different/varied languages. They collaborate and share out in English.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status              a. The school uses Language First and Words Their Way for English Language Learners instructional programs for SIFE.  These instructional programs are aligned with the curriculum program that the school is using.              b. Fundations and Words Their Way programs are used for kindergarten through second grade and Wilson Reading  System and Leaptrack  assessment and instruction system for third grade through fifth grade.            c. For our developing English Language Learners, Words Their Way and Think-Along programs are used to address the five  reading essential components that our English Language Learners need.          d. Think-Along and Leaptrack Reading Pro system are used which focus on reading comprehension, critical thinking and  writing during their ENL periods.          e. English Language Learners who reached the proficiency level or commanding level on the NYSESLAT for a year or two  still receive continuing transitional support. Think-Along and Leaptrack Reading Pro system are used which focuses more on  reading comprehension, critical thinking and writing during the ENL periods.   The materials are ELL grade appropriate and are of different degree or range of difficulty.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The school uses a variety of intervention systems for ELL-SWDs who are at different proficiency levels that both provides  access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development such as Voyagers 1 for phonics, Wilson  leveled-reading books for guided reading, Great Leaps for fluency reading, Orton-Gillingham reading program, which  interventions are built-in and all kinds of manipulatives in math.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?              Instruction is differentiated according to their needs and proficiency level. The teachers and other service providers  meet every Tuesday to collaborate with the instructional plans, approaches, methods and instructional time being used to  meet the diverse needs of this group. Teachers and other service providers have to ensure that ELL-SWDs use the same  curriculum and use differentiated instruction tailored to them and have followed their flexible scheduling so to achieve their  EIP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.        Kindergarten through second grade ELL entering and emerging level groups and are newcomers receive double dose of  Fundations reading system, Reading Rescue and Core Ready intervention piece for both reading and writing. Third grade  through fifth grade entering and emerging level groups and are newcomers receive Wilson reading system and Core Ready  intervention piece for both reading and writing. Eureka Math intervention piece is used as the math intervention program.  English is the language of instruction used.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In this 2017- 2018 school year we are implementing an ELL academy. The  ELL academy started on October 19, 2017 and ends  on May 31, 2018. It is every Thursday from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm. The program incorporates STEAM, field trips to museums and  other places that would enrich and connect their own cultural history and background.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.        English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are engaged into different programs in  the school. They are in after-school programs facilitated by the New York Mission Society where they are honed in arts, music,  dance and sports. Most of our third, fourth and fifth grade English Language Learners are gifted in music, dance, and sports.  Some fourth and fifth grade English Language Learners are part of the Music and Brain after-school program and Inside  Broadway program . Some of first through fifth grade English Language Learners are involved in the Dance, Drum, and Song  program. Some of them are good and promising athletes. They are in the softball and basketball team. Swimming lesson is also  offered to our second grade students at YMCA. Our students including English Language Learners are actively engaged in the  Fuel Up 60. ELL Academy on Fridays, Saturday academies for ELA and math take place for third grade through fifth grade. CITE  program under the Title III fund is provided to English Language Learners in first grade through fifth grade.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.       Our school has a technology laboratory and all classrooms have computers so students can use them when needed. Besides  the computers in the technology lab and classrooms, third grade through fifth grade students have access to laptops during  their ELA specifically when they have to do their final piece of writing and other content areas when doing research.  Kinder  through fifth grade classes have Promethean smart boards that they can use.       Several technology instructional programs are in placed in the school such as, Brainpop which includes Brainpop Jr. and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Brainpop ESL using closed caption abilities to support academic English acquisition, Raz-Kids, Learning A-Z, abcmouse.com and  Renaissance Learning which comprises accelerated  reader, Star early literacy, Star Reading, and Star math. Classroom libraries  have selections of bilingual children books available in Spanish, French, Chinese and Arabic, and dictionaries available in  Spanish, French, Chinese and Arabic versions as well.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,  emphasizing English language acquisition. Students in freestanding ENL programs can come from many different language  backgrounds, and English may be the only common language among students. development instruction. The school uses 2  types of ENL as per CR Part 154. The school uses both push-in and pull-out models. In the push-in model, the ENL teacher  works with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary  support. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or prior collaborative planning. In the pull-out  model, ELLs spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction which are brought together from various classes  for English-acquisition-focused instruction. The ENL teacher plans carefully with general education teachers to ensure  curricular alignment and continuity of instruction.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Mandated services are aligned with the student's age and grade level . The required services and/or resources support  and  correspond to English Language Learners' ages and grade levels because they are also based on their grade level benchmarks  and on Common Core State Standards. The school uses flexible scheduling to ELL-SWDs to address and to adapt to their  needs.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.
