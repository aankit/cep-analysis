This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Expeditionary Learning School for Community Leaders (Leaders) fosters the core values of learning, leading,  contributing, and exploring so that students will graduate as independent thinkers equipped to pursue their passions.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Expeditionary Learning School for Community Leaders (Leaders) was founded with a strong college-going culture  and a mission to prepare all students for college and career. Leaders serves a diverse population with students who  come from over 30 countries and speak 17 different languages. 83% qualify for free or reduced lunch, and nearly 90%  of Leaders graduates will be the first in their families to go to college. Leaders is proud that 100% of graduates have  been accepted into two- or four-year programs since 2012.      In the 2014 – 2015 school year, Leaders was accepted into the New York Performance Standards Consortium, a group  of New York schools granted the right to use a Performance-Based Assessment Task ( PBAT ) rather than the  standardized testing system of the Regents as part of students’ graduation requirements. PBATs are in-depth  analytical papers that students research, develop, and revise in every class. In 11th and 12th grade, students must  publicly defend their PBATs before a panel of teachers and visiting experts during a process called Mastery Passages.  PBATs are a way to assess what students know and can do through in-depth research and analysis and offer students  the opportunity to produce the kind of sophisticated, high-level work typically expected in a college course. They are  an authentic and powerful measure of students’ readiness for the challenges of college-level work. In order to meet  requirements for graduation, Leaders students complete PBATs at the end of every semester and present a minimum  of four Mastery Passages – in English, History, Mathematics, and Science – during their junior and senior years.      Additionally, as one of approximately 60 schools selected to participate in the Progressive Redesign Opportunity  Schools for Excellence (PROSE) program starting in the 2014 – 2015 school year, Leaders administrators, teachers, and  the UFT representative collaborated to develop unique observation systems and structures tailored to teachers’  needs and focused on strengthening instruction and improving student performance. This program includes in-depth  pre- and post-observation conferences with the AP of instruction; opportunities for inter-visitations across grade  levels and disciplines; a comprehensive protocol for discussing and providing feedback on observations with  colleagues; and a Structured Review in which teachers provide evidence and artifacts to measure their progress on  individual, department-wide, and school-wide goals, reflect on the impact of their instruction, and set goals for the  upcoming year. PROSE is further supported by weekly grade and department team meetings as well as bi-monthly  leadership team meetings in which all staff members engage in a five-step PBAT Inquiry Cycle: (1) analyze data; (2)  frame the issue; (3) make an action plan; (4) take action; (5) assess and reflect.      Our school is also dedicated to creating a positive school culture that fosters reflection and character development,  and this commitment is reflected in the time and resources the school has invested in building and strengthening the  Restorative Practices program. Approximately two thirds of teachers have participated in Restorative Circles training  offered through the DOE in partnership with the Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility, and the  practices and beliefs from these trainings have been incorporated by all crew leaders. Leaders runs a robust peer  mediation program in collaboration with the Human Rights Commission, and the work of those students selected to  be peer mediators has reduced the number of conflicts in the building. The Restorative Justice Committee runs circles  to address situations where students have harmed the community, and Leaders will hire a Restorative Practices  Coordinator ( RPC ) to oversee the implementation of consistent practices school-wide beginning in the fall of 2015.  As a result of these shifts in disciplinary practices, we have lowered our suspension rate every year. In 2017-18, we  had our lowest number of principal suspensions in the school's history.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Leaders has partnerships with New York City Outward Bound Schools (NYCOBS ) and EL Education (EL), and through  these collaborations we provide students with innovative curricula and opportunities for hands-on learning because  we believe that learning should be active, challenging, meaningful, public, and collaborative.      Some essential features of EL include:   ● CREW:   At Leaders, students are crew, not passengers, and students are known well and supported by adults. Crew allows  every student to build positive connections with 12 – 15 peers and their crew leader, and this group becomes their  school “family.” Crews meet for one period every day and are a space where students can receive academic support,  share personal challenges and growth, reflect on their progress, and strengthen their character development.   ● STUDENT-LED CONFERENCES:   Instead of traditional parent-teacher conferences, Leaders has student-led conferences ( SLCs ). Twice-a-year students  present their strengths, growth areas, and goals to an audience of their peers, teachers, and families. SLCs allow  students to take the lead in their own learning as they reflect on their progress towards Mastery Passages.   ● INTENSIVES:   For one week in the fall and one in the spring, regular classes are suspended and students select and intensive course  to take. For five days they explore a topic in-depth with visits from experts and fieldwork in the city. In the fall, all  ninth graders participate in Crew Orientation, a free camping trip at the Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill , NY where they  hike, sleep outside, tackle ropes courses, and practice team-building skills with their crews. Tenth graders take part in  a College Intensive including visits to a half dozen schools and an overnight stay outside the city. Other intensives  include topics as varied as NYC Landmarks, Women Warriors, and School to Prison Pipeline.   ● FIELDWORK:   Leaders believes that learning should also happen outside the classroom. Our students regularly go on fieldwork that  enriches their schoolwork and allows students to be researchers not spectators. Through these opportunities,  students are able to meet with experts, make connections between the real world and their courses, and take an  active, hands-on role in their educations.   ● STANDARDS-BASED GRADING:   Leaders knows that every student needs to learn at his/her own pace and believes that students should not be  penalized if it takes them longer to master an academic skill. Instead of traditional grading structures which may be  biased towards students who learn new material quickly, Leaders uses standards-based grading ( SBG ) which tracks  students progress towards long-term learning targets. Students have multiple opportunities to demonstrate progress,  and their grades reflect that growth rather than a one-time, all-or-nothing score.    In the past school year, Leaders made progress in strengthening our Supportive Environment through     our Restorative Justice Program which relies on input from students, families, teachers, mental health      professionals, deans, and administrators;  the expansion of student leadership to foster a school culture where students feel safe and supported as  demonstrated by three key programs:   o  peer mediation  o  peer mentors   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         o  college mentors     our crew advisory program and a three-year workplan goal that seeks to strengthen and align the scope and         sequence for this course over students’ four years at Leaders;  the expansion of our internship program including hiring a full-time internship coordinator to ensure that all  students complete an internship in their junior year and to provide additional volunteer, work, and learning  opportunities outside of regular school hours for all students;  school-wide celebrations, presentations, and initiatives throughout the year (e.g., SLCs, PoL, intensives,  diversity day, respect for all week, spirit week, pep rally, crew cleanup, etc.).   3.

Our school serves a diverse population with students who come from over 30 countries and speak 17 different  languages. 83% qualify for free or reduced lunch, and nearly 90% of Leaders graduates will be the first in their families  to go to college. 24% of our students have IEPs. We also serve 29 students who we know live in a temporary housing  situation.       Needs include ELL services, such as co-taught classes and stand alone English classes. We also provide after school  reading support. Due to many of these circumstances, many of our students need counseling.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   For the 2018 – 2019 school year, our school is committed to strengthening Teacher Collaboration through:           redesigned professional learning structures that more effectively allot time and resources to supporting adult  learning;  continued implementation of PBAT Inquiry Cycles in department, leadership, and grade teams;  teacher-led inquiry cycles in cross-grade and content-affinity groups including inter-visitations, weekly  meetings, and relevant research;  the beginning-of-year Expedition Planning Week;  the end-of-year structured portfolio review;         beginning-of-, mid-, and end-of-year huddles with the leadership team and school designer;     long-term work plan goals aligned to fostering deep and flexible thinking in students and teachers and making  PBATs authentic, rigorous final products in a variety of formats.     On our Quality Review Report, compared to last year, we have seen growth in Effective School Leadership,   Rigorous Instruction, Student Achievement, and Trust.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K572   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   347   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        STRENGTHS   Expedition Planning Week at the end of summer provides an opportunity for teachers to collaborate and refine their  expedition plans (or units) for the year. Teachers participate in workshops facilitated by the Principal, AP of  Instruction, School Designer (SD), Instructional Guide (IG), and Special Education Coordinator and use this learning to  revise and refine their plans. By the end of this week, teachers have developed high quality expeditions and rigorous  summative assessments (PBATs ) that are aligned to CCLS , PBAT rubrics, and EL core practices.    Throughout the year, teachers meet weekly in department teams and affinity groups where they conduct a five-step  PBAT Inquiry Cycle: (1) analyze data; (2) frame the issue; (3) make an action plan; (4) take action; (5) assess and  reflect. Teachers meet regularly to assess data, revise lesson plans, and develop instructional strategies to address  student needs. In team meetings, teachers analyze student work to plan interventions and strategies to aid students  in meeting the rigor of the CCLS . As a result, collaborative data analysis and lesson planning map out a clear and  timely plan for students’ progress and growth, which improves student achievement.    Staff use data from PBAT Benchmarks (interim assessments) given halfway through each semester to revise curricula  and lesson plans and to target instruction to meet the needs of struggling students. For example, students in grade  nine sit for diagnostic tests in English and mathematics and undergo a character assessment, which they then take the  results and have “accountable talks” during their crew. Additionally, grade teams conduct Student Support Team ( SST  ) meetings co-facilitated with the school guidance counselor in order to ensure students’ social/emotional needs are  not negatively impacting their academic performances.    Grade team meetings are also a space in which teachers collaborate to create interdisciplinary curricula and fieldwork  and share practices (e.g., revision protocols, strategies to teach the writing process, etc.) that can be used across  content areas. Intensives – week-long units where students explore a topic in-depth and collaborate with teachers  and peers from across the disciplines and grades – are a particularly rich opportunity for interdisciplinary work.  Intensives provide students with relevant learning experiences in areas such as social justice, the culinary arts, and  women’s issues that also include experiments. These experiences culminate in students giving presentations which  require the use of technology and art to display the content and communicate what they learned. The availability of  curricula that enables students to discover, create, and communicate information using the arts, technology, and  other enrichment areas improves academic performance and student achievement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Finally, twice a year, all teachers participate in two days of professional development to prepare for Mastery  Passages. During these workshops teachers “norm” on the PBAT rubric, analyze student work, develop rich and  rigorous questions to push students’ thinking during their presentations, and provide feedback to both the student on  his/her written work and the teacher on his/her task design.                AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT   We are striving to make sure that ALL students are consistently challenged to think deeply and flexibly. In doing so, we  hope to increase the academic press and rigor of the educational experience of our students.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June of 2019, students will consistently engage in deep and flexible thinking in a variety of contexts as a result of  teachers consistently engaging in deep and flexible thinking in a variety of contexts. This clearly aligns with the  Framework Element of Rigorous Instruction.      One way to measure this will be for us to see an increased number of teachers being observed in the Highly   Effective category for 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques and 3c: Engaging Students In Learning.      By 2019, we will see higher scores in the Rigorous Instruction section of the survey results.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  We will increase parent involvement through parent workshops led by our guidance counselor and social worker.    Also, instead of traditional parent-teacher conferences, Leaders has student-led conferences ( SLCs ). Twice-a-year  students present their strengths, growth areas, and goals to an audience of their peers, teachers, and families. SLCs  allow students to take the lead in their own learning as they reflect on their progress towards Mastery Passages.   We also have an active Parents Association who meets regularly.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  STRENGTHS   To address the social and emotional health of students, Leaders has designated an adult to coordinate each student’s  needs, has a referral and support system, uses data to identify needs, and developed partnerships to provide  necessary interventions. Crew provides supports for students’ academic progress and social-emotional development.  The teacher leader of each crew is the designated adult responsible for monitoring and supporting student growth  and progress, both socially and academically. During weekly SST meetings in grade teams, crew leaders serve as the  point person for referrals and support for students in each advisory group. The school guidance counselor attends  these meetings, and the team uses the student information available on JumpRope as well as a Leaders specific SST  protocol to address barriers to social-emotional developmental health and academic needs. The comprehensive  system to support and sustain student social and emotional developmental health promotes academic and social  success for all students.    Leaders’ comprehensive approach to character development and social/emotional support includes peer mentors,  peer mediators, the restorative justice committee, deans, guidance counselors, and crew leaders.             AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT   Further develop and expand restorative practices through crew and the RPC to ensure the social, emotional and  academic development of students through the regular collection, analysis and use of data to inform whole group and  individual needs.      To strengthen our capacity in both of these areas we have hired a new social worker for the 2018-19 school year.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

STRENGTHS   Classroom instruction supports the CCLS and provides multiple points of access for students. In classroom visitations,  the IIT assessed that teachers use of instructional practices support the CCLS . Based on classroom observation and  teacher lesson plans reviewed, the IIT found that teachers provide students with multiple points of access to the  curricula through a wide variety of strategies and techniques, including turn and talk, Socratic seminars, annotation,  role playing, student designed experiments, graphic organizers, use of real-world problems, and opportunities to  engage with experts. Student work reviewed in the small student focus group included feedback from teachers and  multiple revisions by students that indicate that next steps provided were monitored for student understanding and  short-term goal achievement. Curricula and instructional strategies that provide multiple ways for students to engage  in learning and achieve targeted learning goals provide opportunities for high levels of achievement. Teachers  develop plans informed by data, and establish grade-level goals for all groups of students; instructional strategies and  short- and long-term student goals are aligned to the instructional plans to promote student engagement. Based on  the review of lesson plans, student interviews, and classroom visitations, the IIT found that teachers use instructional  practices and strategies aligned to plans that include accommodations for students with disabilities and ELLs . In  addition, the school provides instructional interventions for students that lead to inquiry and engagement. In  interviews, teachers reported that they place short- and long-term learning targets and standards-based goals in  student-friendly language on materials provided to students, and use these to grade students. The use of targeted  plans and explicit goals allows the school to monitor progress toward meeting objectives and promotes student  engagement in learning.      AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT:   Consistently use CCLS instructional practices that foster constructive struggle including strategies that promote access  to complex texts that lead all students to improvements in completion of authentic higher order thinking tasks.

A review of the School Comprehensive Education Plan (  SCEP ) showed that the school vision and goals are focused on ensuring college-readiness for all students. Teachers  stated that to further this vision they are accountable for building students’ skills, improving students’ work, and  helping students achieve academic goals. Wide dissemination and understanding of the school vision results in the  entire school community working toward measurable and realistic goals that promote student achievement. School  leaders have established systems to collect data about student progress that lead to school improvement. Staff  members use these data systems to identify student needs, set student goals, and communicate student progress. In  IIT interviews, school leaders stated that JumpRope , an online data management system, fosters the collection of  attendance, anecdotal information, and grades to enable timely communication of data to all stakeholders in the  community, including students and parents. Members of the school support team ( SST ) spoke about using  attendance data to identify student needs; advisors discussed using data to conference with students about goal  setting and academic progress, which is communicated to parents during parent meetings. The school leader  instituted Crew Advisory, a school program with a rigorous coherent curriculum to support students’ academic  progress that links to students’ social and emotional development. The teacher leader of each Crew Advisory  monitors and supports student progress, socially and academically. These practices and systems allow the school to  make information on student achievement accessible to the school community. As a result, the comprehensive  system to examine and improve practices across student needs promote progress to achieve school goals.   ● Need: 2.4: Provide and implement a prioritized schedule of targeted and frequent observations that   provide constructive and instructive feedback around the use of assessment data to inform   curriculum and instruction in order to ensure more opportunities for students to self-asses.

School staff has respect for the diversity of the school community and communicate with families in languages they  understand, such as English, Cantonese, Spanish, Russian, Uzbek, and Arabic. The school leader reported that the  school uses Department of Education (DOE) translation services, as well as bilingual staff and students, to  communicate with families in writing, in person, and on the telephone in the various languages. According to students  and parents, translators are present at parent-teacher conferences and student led presentations, and staff assists  with bilingual needs in Spanish, Russian, Arabic, or Cantonese; a pamphlet welcoming new parents to the school are  provided in English and those four languages, as well. The school leader also reported that the school sends academic  reports to families in a timely manner. Based on interviewed , the IIT determined that the school has a reciprocal  communication protocol between the staff and families. For example, parents expressed that the school staff respects  and acknowledges the diversity and needs of families in the school community. The school’s ability to maintain  reciprocal communication with families in languages they understand enables the identification of students’ strengths  and weaknesses, which allows families to support student social and academic growth.   Staff receives PD to provide social and emotional health supports and foster student success. A review of the PD  binder showed offerings for teachers about how to positively communicate and interact with families to build and  sustain healthy relationships linked to student needs. The school leader reported, and documents confirmed, that  staff attends PD offered by the Children First Network, District Family Advocate, and Division of Family and  Community Engagement focusing on family services and family engagement. In addition to the guidance team and the  Crew Advisory, the school staff provide families with referrals to outside agencies such as the CAMBA AIDP to support  physical and mental health, as well as parenting and student learning. Parents and students reported that they  support one another and help each other address academic and social-emotional issues to ensure success in the  school. As a result, the consistent collaboration between school constituencies connects families and community  agencies to optimize the supports and increase student engagement and success.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Expeditionary Learning School for Community Leaders, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Expeditionary School for Community Leaders will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The program consists of a stand- alone English, individualized tutoring, and an after school Reading Mentors Program.    Our ELL stand-alone English class reinforces concepts from their English class with explicit  instruction on grammar, reading, writing, pronunciation, and presentation skills. We also provide  support around cultural awareness.   Art and graphic novels are also incorporated into the  class.  This class does lots of field work outside of the building such as going to the Poet's Den  (an ESL Theater Company specifically designed for immigrant students).  The class uses  community exploration as a way to teach English in a meaningful, real-world, context.   Our Reading Mentors program matches our former ELLs with current ELLs who speak the same  first language.  These pairs meet twice a week after school to read books together.  Following a  carefully designed protocol, the students take turns reading to each other.  The mentor  consistently checks in to ensure comprehension and models pronunciation.   After each sessions,  the mentor completes an online survey to track progress.  The program is both practical in that it  gives the students time to focus on their reading and inspirational because working with the  mentor who was recently in their shoes allows the students to see that language acquisition is  within their reach.   The program is supervised and supported by our four ELL certified  teachers.   The mentors are paid through our Title III LEP funds (G9GA).   Tutoring will consist of extra help for any content area.  Teachers will help students  understanding notes, texts, or assignments; give feedback on products and assist in all phases of  writing; or give students personalized instruction in the English language.  Tutoring will be  available 2-3 days per week, while other students in the program are working independently.    We will also running an after school ELA Regents Prep for ELL students.  This take place  throughout the year and intensifies as the test approaches.     ELL Regents Prep class during the day.  This class is specifically designed to address the  ELA skills outlined in the Common Core, but taught in a way that addresses the needs of ELL  students.   Data from reading assessments, as well as teacher observation, indicate that low literacy in  English is the biggest barrier for most ELLs to passing the Regents exams.  Alternate  assessments indicate that they understand much more content than practice Regents tests  show.  Students themselves report that they do not understand many of the questions and  answers.  More troubling is the fact that they do not understand high-school-level texts in their  classes, and much read lower-level alternatives.  This indicates that they need to improve their  reading level in English dramatically in order to be college-ready.  Therefore, guided reading  will be emphasized two days per week.  Both guided and independent reading will also be  available on the other two days for students for whom this is their biggest barrier.  Our ESL  library has hundreds of books ranging from Fountas and Pinnell levels C-post Z, which can be  used for guided and partner reading.  Additionally, we have Achieve 3000 a guided reading  computer program that has been proven to improve students' reading levels multiple years in  one.  Students' reading levels will be tested regularly to measure their growth, and inform  personalized changes if needed.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   As is typical of most ELLs, our ELLs are more proficient in social English than academic  English.  We know this because they score higher on fiction than nonfiction reading  comprehension assessments, and our teachers consistently report that ELLs are most successful  when information and assignments are rephrased into social language.  This will be addressed in  ESL Enrichment.  One day per week students will view about15-20 minutes of videos or film,  and use it to have a discussion involving high-order thinking.  The emphasis for most students  will be on building listening and speaking proficiency with academic language.  Differentiation  will allow beginners to build their social language skills as well.  Academic vocabulary and  sentence structure will be addressed, and instruction will be informed by data from ESL and  content teachers.  All students will improve their higher-order thinking skills.  Data and student work from the ESL and ELA teachers indicate that grammar is a weak point for  most of our ELLs.  One day per week there will be a writing lesson focused on conventions, with  a related writing “challenge”.  On the other days there will be a short writing challenge that  reinforces the same skill as the lesson.  Lessons will be chosen by speaking with teachers and  identifying trends in student work.  Leaders High School has a strong culture of students staying after school for extra help, practice,  or community service.  Therefore, we expect a consistent turnout, with beginners voluntarily  attending almost every day.  Higher level students will come less often because they will split  their time with other after school programs and help sessions, but we nonetheless expect that  most will include our program as well. We will make the program mandatory for any student  who is struggling in a class due to language barriers, at that teacher's discretion.

Our ELL team, including our Principal, Tom Mullen, has been working closely with his mentor,  Norma Vega.  The focus of the mentorship has been to develop strategies for serving our ELL  and SIFE students.   We have been meeting monthly.  Norma has also visited ELL classes and  given us feedback.

This is also given to  them in person at parent-teacher conferences.  The availability of translation and interpretation  services is announced in signs prominently placed in the main office on the main bulletin board,  in all languages available on the DOE website provided in the Chancellor's Regulations.    We are in the process of designing more activities for parents of ELLs.  Ideas include potlucks  that are connected to workshops.    Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Our school uses the McLeod reading assessment to determine students’ reading levels.  Students are administered the  assessment when they first enter into the school in ELA class.  This data helps us to address literacy in all classes, and come up  with school-wide strategies for supporting students in literacy.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Regular English Department meetings with ELL Teachers and planning meetings.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We measure the success of our ESL program by looking at student growth measures, including student work, standardized  tests, and the degree to which they participate in school activities alongside native English speakers.  We expect our students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         to demonstrate at least 1.5 years of growth each year, with a goal of 2-3 years depending on grade and proficiency level, so  that they can graduate on time with the skills necessary to succeed in college and careers.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Regular planning meetings.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school uses interim assessment data, NYSESLAT and LAB-R scores to plan instruction.  ESL teachers review data and meet  with content area teachers to ensure that instruction is differentiated and appropriately scaffolded for ELLs.  Teacher teams  assess student progress during SST meetings (student support teams).       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Higher grades are overall more proficient.  This may be because most students, regardless of age and educational background,  are forced to start high school as a ninth grader with few or no credits.  Also, our students are overall more proficient in  conversational English (listening and speaking) as compared with academic English (reading and writing).  Thus, we have  decided to focus heavily on formal, academic reading and writing.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We disseminate information through weekly grade team meetings, regular crew team meetings, and regular department  meetings.  This is in addition to Jumprope comments and emails.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1a.  Our Freestanding ESL program consists of both push-in and pull-out classes.  1b.  Push-in classes are mostly graded though students with unique circumstances might be in a course that is not  standard for their grade.  Push-in classes are heterogeneous by proficiency level, and include students who are not  LEP as well.  Pull-out classes are ungraded.  The general ESL class is heterogeneous by proficiency level as well, but the  beginners’ ESL class, which provides the additional 180 minutes that beginners need each week, is only for beginners  or select low-intermediate students with unique circumstances.  We do not use block classes   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                  Our standard programming provides each ELL with one push-in Global History or ELA class, which meets for 248  minutes per week.  Intermediate proficiency students are additionally in a general ESL class, which meets for 150 minutes per   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      week.  Beginning proficiency students are in the push-in class, general ESL class, and an additional beginner ESL class that  meets for 248 minutes per week.  Beginning and low-intermediate proficiency students are in an additional ESL tutoring  session for 60 minutes per week, in which they receive support in developing English proficiency and/or meeting the language  demands of content classes.  Advanced and most intermediate proficiency students are additionally are in a full-time ELA class  that meets for 248 minutes per week.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         At our school, instruction in all classes is in English (with the exception of foreign language classes).  Our goal is to provide  lessons in all content classes that are accessible and appropriate for all students.  Strategies for supporting ELL’s are woven  into all lessons, and teachers use strategies such as providing visuals, highlighting key words, differentiating texts, activating  background knowledge, pre-teaching important vocabulary, and strategic grouping.  Lessons are scaffolded for all students as  needed, with additional scaffolding for individual students when needed.  All students, including ELL’s, are supported in  meeting the same standards and completing the same products.  Literacy is addressed in all content classes, in alignment with  the Common Core Standards, and students read and write daily.  ESL teachers have an extensive collection of leveled high- interest-low-level books aligned with the New York State high school standards, ranging from Fontis and Pinnel level C through  Z and higher.  All teachers have access to these books and use them to differentiate texts or provide additional support to ELL’s  in their classes.  Additionally, the ESL teachers are available to support all teachers in planning lessons that meet the needs of  ELL’s.  An ESL teachers is available everyday for at least 75 minutes after school to help students develop their English language  skills or support them with other content area classes.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Interim assessments are administered four times a year.  After administering IAs, teacher teams comprised of the ESL  teacher, content teachers, crew advisors and administrators review data and plan next steps.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. Since we have so few SIFEs, plans are made on an individual basis.  Generally, factors that are considered are the student’s  literacy in their first language; years without school; whether or not they are accustomed to following school norms (even if  those norms are very different from those in American culture); quality of previous education and student’s current skills in all  content areas; and the basic skills that are necessary for successfully learning and participating in school, such as taking notes,  studying, and completing assignments on time.  6b.  Newcomer ELLs have varying English proficiency levles, L1 literacy levels, and educational backgrounds.  Therefore, we do  not use one single strategy to address all of them.  However, one practice that is important for all newcomers is to constantly  diagnose their current knowledge and skills before the start of a unit.  Teachers are aware that knowledge that is taken for  granted in American culture might not be familiar to students of other cultures, such as the significance of Thanksgiving, and  make careful decisions about topics that might put ELL’s at a significant disadvantage.  If a lesson depends on material that is  culturally biased toward Americans (i.e. American History and Government), differentiated group strategies for building  background knowledge are utilized.  6c.  ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years are guided to pull meaning from difficult sources, understand the finer points of  English grammar, and write extended works close to the level of their native-English-speaking peers.  However, they are  provided the scaffolding and support they need to reach this standard.  6d.  Long-term ELLs are referred to grade-wide student support teams to assist ESL teachers in identifying and addressing  barriers to proficiency.  Individual plans are made and shared with the student to address their English proficiency needs.  The  student has an opportunity to help shape the final version of the plan.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   As a New York Performance Based Consortium School, we offer Performance Based Assessment Tasks each semester in each  content class every year. PBATs rely heavily on complex reading, sophisticated writing, and rich discussion. With that said,  these assessments all ELLs with the rigth amount of support and opportunities to succeed.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students with disabilities are served in ICT classes.  None of our students are required to be in self-contained classes or to have  all ICT classes.  We ensure that they have the correct number of ICT classes in addition to their ESL push-in class.  Teachers  have access to their students’ IEPs, and special education teachers are available to assist in planning lessons to meet the needs  of all students, and to differentiate for particular students.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELA-An ESL teacher pushes into a Regents ELA class.  Social Studies-An ESL teacher pushes into a majority 9th grade Global History I class and a majority 10th grade Global History II  class.  Science-High-interest-low-level books aligned to the New York State standards for Living Environment, Physics, and Chemistry  are recommended to science teachers based on their specific lessons and students.  Math-Manipulatives and graphic high-interest-low-level books are used by the math teachers to illustrate abstract concepts.        Our ESL library with leveled texts (Fountas and Pinnell C-Z) is aligned to NY State curriculum standards.  Bilingual dictionaries  are available to all teachers in all languages spoken in the school.  Students are provided a dictionary that they may use both in  school and at home until the end of the year.  Newcomers are taught effective ways of using their dictionaries, and teachers  encourage students to use it in class as an aid.  ESL teachers are available as a resource to support content area teaches in  planning lessons and designing scaffolds for ELLs.  An ESL teacher is available for after school tutoring in any subject, at student  or teacher request.  Additionally, students who are identified by grade teams as needing additional ESL support are assigned a  tutoring class that meets 60 minutes per week.  All ELLs receive testing accommodations on all tests in accordance to  mandates.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For next year, we will work on incorporating more professional development opportunities for our content area teachers who  teach ELLs.  We plan to organize action research team to study ELL strategies.  This group, comprised of content area teachers  and ESL teachers, will present their research to the full staff.  Additionally, we will look to build upon the ESL library by adding a  wider variety of resources.  We would like to add materials both in English and in students’ native language to build up their  literacy skills and ensure that students are maintaining their native language.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   As of right now, we have not determined that we will discontinue any of our services to ELLs.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are provided equal access to all school programs partially because our school is a small, nurturing community.  All  students are assigned to a “Crew.”  Each Crew is comprised of roughly 15 students and one staff member.  Students stay with  their crew leaders for all four years of high school.  This person is a liaison between the student and the Crew leader; they  advocate for the student and work to communicate with parents/families on a regular basis.  The ESL teachers are available  every day after school for individual student tutoring.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials to support ELLs include: the ESL resource library, 8 mobile computer carts, 2 Mac labs, smartboard  technology in every classroom, Rosetta Stone, as well as a collection of dictionaries in students’ native language.  Students are  permitted to borrow to a dictionary for the year.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided through the use of resources in the ESL library.  Students are encouraged to use Google  Translator and/or digital translators/dictionaries.  Bilingual dictionaries are provided.  Teachers share strategies with students  for using these to their advantage.  Teachers may give students a parallel text in the students’ native language to ensure higher  order thinking.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   We use high interest low-level texts to for all content area instruction.  Content for all classes, including ESL, is rigorous,  requires higher order thinking and is at a high school level.  Students complete the same products as their peers, however  additional scaffolding, support after school and other support is provided to ensure high quality products aligned to  standards.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials to support ELLs include: the ESL resource library, 8 mobile computer carts, 2 Mac labs, smartboard  technology in every classroom, Rosetta Stone, as well as a collection of dictionaries in students’ native language.  Students are  permitted to borrow to a dictionary for the year.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students and families are encouraged to attend a series of open houses at our school.  We always provide translation services  to our ELL population as we have number of language spoken amongst the staff.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives are not currently offered to any students at our school due to the fact that we have a small staff and a  limited budget.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?     1.  ESL teachers attend PD that are scheduled periodically this year.  This year, D will include the utilization of ELL data as well  as supporting content area teachers.  Our content area teachers will participate in a “Learning Expedition” around ELL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         strategies.  During the expedition, content area teachers will read common texts focusing on best practices and participate in  fieldwork at another high school in our campus.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   1.  Parents are invited into the school for a number of activities including college workshops, back to school night and student- led conferences.  Students are encouraged to attend these events with their parents (and many of them do).  In these cases,  students do much of the translation for parents.  Additionally, our staff has diverse linguistic backgrounds.  Some languages  spoken include Spanish, Korean, Russian, Mandarin, Uzbek and Urdu.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Thomas Mullen, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Expeditionary Learning School                                                                              School DBN: 21K572  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When students are enrolled, parents are given the Home Language Survey. If they indicate that a language other  than English is spoken at home, they are given an in-depth survey and interview that includes which language  they want the school to use when commnicating with them. This is recorded by the secretary and ESL coordinator.  Additionally, advisors are responsible for communicating with the parents of their students regularly. Therefore,  they are expected to find out the preferred language of families at the start of the school year. This information is  recorded on the students' emergency cards and in ATS. It is shared with administrators, the parent coordinator,  and any other staff member organizing schoolwide events, mailings, or communication. We request new  emergency cards from students' families at least three times per year, to ensure the information is current.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Approximately a quarter of  the students at our school  have parents who prefer  communicating in a  language other than  English. There are 10  different languages, with  the largest groups being  Spanish and Chinese. Some  languages, such as Uzbek  and Albanian, do not have  translations of major  documents on the DOE  website, such as ELL  Entitlement Letters. This  information is shared in our  internal data system, called  Jumprope. Jumprope has  many features, but one is  that it makes biographical  information and contact  information available for  each student, including  their family's preferred  language for  communication.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       Spanish documents are translated by  staff members, but we use the  Department of Education's approved  vendor to translate other languages if  it can be submitted far enough in  advance. For urgent documents, in  which information is not known far  enough in advance and must be  communicated immediately, Google  Translate is used for a rough  translation. A cover letter is included  explaining that parents can get a free,  more accurate translation by  contacting crew leaders or returning  that cover letter with the specified box  checked off indicating they want an  oral translation. The crew leader will  then contact the parent using the  Translation and Interpretation Unit to  translate the content of the letter.    Documents that are translated by our  school are our Student Led  Conferences Night, Monthly Calendar,  important dates, testing schedule,  policy letters, and family welcome  night events.    For communication by phone, all staff  members are expected to use the  DOE's telephone translation services if  no staff member is able to translate  that language at that time. We have  staff members who help with Spanish,  Chinese, Russian, and Urdu when they  are available. We also use telephone or  staff translators when parents visit the  school for meetings or other matters.    At school events, such as Orientation,  student volunteers translate for  families who prefer to communicate in  a language other than English. In the  unlikely case that no student or staff  volunteers to translate for a particular  language, we will use an outside  translator. If the family asks to speak  about their child's academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67     achievement, conduct, or other  personal matters, a separate meeting  is set up so that an adult translator can  be used.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   interpretation service(s)?

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      At the beginning of each year and at the first parent-teacher conferences, parents receive a copy of the Bill of Parent  Rights and Responsibilities in their preferred language. This is also given to them in person at parent-teacher  conferences. The availability of translation and interpreptation services is announced in signs prominently placed in  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      the main office on the main bulletin board, in all languages available on the DOE website provided in the Chancellor's  Regulations. There is no uncovered language that is preferred by 10% or more of our students' families, so no  additional signs are needed according to the Regulations. However, if this ever is the case we will have the sign  translated by staff or the Translation and Interpretation Unit so it can be posted with the others. Our school shares a  safety plan with the other schools in the Lafayette Education Complex. This plan requires that translation and  interpretation services are accessed and funded immediately in case of emergency.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our parents will complete the NYC DOE Parent Survey that will give our school valuable feedback regarding quality  and availability of services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
