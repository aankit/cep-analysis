The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Leaders of Tomorrow (11x370) is a co-located school within the Richard R. Green Community Campus. The school is  located in the Williamsbridge area of the Bronx within District 11, and will serve approximately 420 students in grades  6-8 for the 2018-2019 school year. The Leaders of Tomorrow student body is comprised of 58% Black, 37% Hispanic,  2% Asian/American Indian/Pacific Islander and 3% White. Boys account for 57.39% of the student body and girls  account for 42.61%. As part of our demographics our student body also includes 13% English Language Learners (ELLs)  and 31% of our population is comprised of Students with Disabilities (SWDs). The average attendance for the 2018- 2019 school year was 91.4%. (Insert data)   Over the past years, our school has made progress in our students’ progress measure on the NY state ELA and math  exams. For the 2017-2018 school year, we met our target in the area of rigorous instruction and student achievement.  We are still working diligently to raise our student proficiency levels as they are at 28% for ELA and 15% for Math for  the 2017-2018 school year. Progress has also been made over the last few years in regards to parent engagement.  Parent engagement has risen from 43% of parents answering the NYC School Survey to 46% answering it in 2017- 2018.       At Leaders of Tomorrow we teach our students through hands-on and real world learning that infuses reading, writing  and technology across all subjects. At Leaders of Tomorrow, we also value the social and emotional development of  our young learners.      Our scholars at the Leaders of Tomorrow will be taught to think critically and to think and act as leaders. Our students  are being prepared for high school and college readiness through curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) and the NYC instructional shifts for English Language Arts and mathematics.      In the 2017-2018 school year, our scholars engaged in rigorous activities as evidenced through the work products  included within our students' promotional student portfolios.   In the 2018-2019 school year, the following student activities and programs will be available to our students: Dance,  Art, Theater/Drama, Robotics, STEM, Basketball, VolleyBall, Flag Football, Chess, Music, iReady (academic), Aviation  Club, Gaming Club, Boys & Girls groups, Student Mentoring.      The school leaders at Leaders of Tomorrow believe in keeping open lines of communication with our parents and  families. Our Parent Coordinator will collaborate with our CBO support staff to help provide parents with a monthly   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      newsletter and calendar informing them of upcoming meetings, forums, classes, conferences, workshops, and special  events for students, parents, and families. Our faculty will also continue to notify parents of student progress through:  the use of Skedula; through weekly parent engagement sessions; and student-led Parent/Teacher conferences for the  2018-2019 school year.   Leaders of Tomorrow will continue to partner with our Community Based Organization (CBO)- Phipps Neighborhoods  and Astor Services for Children & Families. Our school’s partnership with Phipps and Astor will help continue to bring  socio-emotional, mental-health, and academic services and support staff to help our school in its transformation into  a Community School model. The school also has also secured partnerships that include the Middle School Quality  Initiative (MSQI), Learning Partners, Teacher's College, The Morgan Library, The Arthur Project, College Access for All,  Algebra for All, and Urban Advantage. The school also received a School Improvement Grant (SIG) and Restorative  Justice pilot funding, which have helped to bring in critical partnerships into our school community: Ramapo for  Children, The Leadership Project, Creative Connections, and New York Hall of Science.    All students at Leaders of Tomorrow will have access to two online libraries with access to over 8,000 digital online  books through MyOn and our ENL students have access to online learning through Imagine Learning. Additional soft  cover library books have been ordered and will be used to enhance our classroom libraries throughout the school.  Teachers at the school are also receiving professional development from Teachers College to continue the integration  of Teachers College writing units of study for the upcoming school year. This curricula will help to support our school- wide focus on literacy across the content areas. Over the summer and throughout the upcoming school year, the  school will be participating in Teacher College training sessions, as needed.    During the 2018-2019 school year, our school professional development will continue to be guided by data gathered  from informal and formal teacher observations to evaluate the instructional practices of our teachers using the  Danielson Framework for Effective Teaching. After review of teachers’ Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) data, the  school leaders determined a need to focus on Domain#3 of the Danielson Framework, as we believe these are the  critical Danielson components that directly impact student achievement. Danielson Components 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d  have also been selected as the focus evaluation components for the 2018-2019 school year, based on our Measures  of Teacher Practice (MOTP) data findings.    In order to build teacher capacity, Leaders of Tomorrow will use in-house and outside coaches and consultants to  support teacher development including New Teacher Center, UFT Center, Peer Collaborative Teachers, Model  teachers, Leadership consultant, Restorative Justice pilot coach, and Ramapo coaches. The school is also developing  and promoting our own teachers into teacher leadership roles through the Teacher Career Pathways incentive  program. All our teachers will participate in Professional Development (PD) sessions on Monday and Tuesday. On  Wednesdays, our teachers will meet in collaborative teacher teams based on subject matter and by grade level.  During the day, teachers will meet a minimum of 4 times a week to collaborate on lesson plans and adjustments to  their curriculum. As we are focusing on literacy, our Science and Social Studies teachers will participate in weekly  teacher team meetings with the English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. School leaders in collaboration with the  school's Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) will be collaborating on enhancements to the school’s curricula and  programming, to further support student achievement before and throughout the upcoming school year. Professional  development will continue for our teachers but will undergo some scheduling modifications due to the mandate of  the ‘Renewal School Hour.’ The additional hour of instructional time will continue to be integrated Monday-Friday,  and will remain mandated for all students. Teachers will still receive time in the 2018-2019 school schedule and  program to continue the professional development, parent engagement, and other professional work as mandated.   Leaders of Tomorrow will continue our partnership with the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI), which will  continue into the 2018-2019 school year. Through this partnership, the understanding set-forth is that all teachers are  teachers of literacy. The school is also a Learning Partners school with the co-located schools on the campus and the  Michelangelo School 11x144. Leaders of Tomorrow will monitor our student progress in ELA and math through the  use of Ready paper and pencil assessments and iReady online diagnostics administered across all grades. iReady will   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13      also be used as a common assessment for ELA and math, grades 6-8, to track student progress towards meeting our  Renewal School student achievement goals and benchmark targets.    Our school’s Instructional Focus for the 2018-2019 school year: “If we develop clear curricular trajectories across  departments aligned to our instructional expectations then students will be presented with consistent and coherent  instruction that builds in complexity leading to accelerated student learning."    At Leaders of Tomorrow the school leaders and staff believe the following:   ● It is important to know our students   ● Students need time to practice basic skills   ● Students benefit from opportunities to discuss content with their peers   ● Students learn when instruction includes scaffolds   ● Students take ownership of their learning when they are part of the decision making process   As a Renewal School, we are excited to expand the implementation of the following school improvement strategies  into the 2018-2019 school year:    ● Expanded Learning Time opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool  and/or summer programming, provided in collaboration with the CBO    ● Transformation into a community school model in order to increase student and family access to physical and  mental health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school   ● Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and instruction  aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding to the  differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students    ● Additional focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement with support from our CBO   The Leaders of Tomorrow staff is looking forward to continuing our work and collaboration with the other community  school within the Richard R. Green campus. Our goal is to make our school and campus a more welcoming and  inclusive learning environment for all our stakeholders. The school leaders within the campus are currently  collaborating, planning, and discussing ways to work together to share resources to benefit entire school community.  Together we know we can make a difference. We embrace the new initiatives and supports brought forth through the  Renewal School and Community School initiatives and look forward to our partnership with Phipps and Astor in  continuing to support our transformation into a model community school and collaborative community campus.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X370   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   400   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Leaders of Tomorrow 2018-2019 curricula will incorporate strategically chosen Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)  focus standards and units created by teacher teams aligned to the school’s selected CCLS focus standards and the  instructional shifts. Structured ‘Independent Reading Time’ and 'strategic writing' periods will be embedded to promote  time for additional independent reading and writing in ELA. Students will be asked to complete more higher level tasks  that incorporate a written response that allows students to articulate in writing and discuss with their peers their  thinking behind solving the mathematical task and/or problems. The Social Studies and Science curriculum will be  aligned to the NYC Social Studies Scope and Sequence and Science Scope and Sequence and will incorporate focus Next  Generation literacy standards selected by the school leaders and teachers. All other subjects will be aligned to the CCLS  literacy focus standards and the content standards for their subject. Common CCLS aligned rubrics from TC will be used  to track progress on selected writing standards across grades and subjects. An additional hour of Expanded Learning  Time will continue to be embedded in the school’s program Monday-Friday to allow for RTI, AIS, and/or additional  learning activities and enrichment opportunities for students. Saturday Academy will also help provide students with  additional learning time and activities open to all our scholars.    School leaders and staff will collaborate with our selected Community Based Organization (CBO) to integrate learning  experiences that include blended learning opportunities like Smart Start math program, in order to enhance student  engagement and learning. The CBO will also help to support and provide learning opportunities, workshops, and  services for our parents based on their interests and needs.   Pedagogical practices will incorporate an emphasis on lesson planning, teacher collaboration, independent reading,  discussion opportunities for students, writing within subject areas aligned to Teachers College reading/writing units,  and use of common CCLS aligned rubrics.   Teachers will target the three major learning modalities of students within their lesson planning to provide a common  school-wide Universal Design for Learning (UDL) instructional strategy that provides multiple entry points, ensuring that  each child can access the curriculum. Strategies for citing evidence, Accountable Talk strategies, Talk Moves, effective  questioning, scaffolds, and checks for understanding will continue to be used as common school-wide instructional  practices.       The school leaders and lead teachers/coaches will monitor consistency of school-wide instructional strategies, so that  teachers are provided with actionable feedback and resources to support the continued practice of chosen school-wide  instructional strategies.    The school will have common assessments for ELA and math, i-Ready online diagnostics and Ready will serve as  benchmark assessments to monitor and track predicted student performance on state tests, and will serve as data for  teachers to determine modifications needed within their lessons and/or units. Teachers College (TC) rubrics will be used  in ELA, Science, and Social Studies to assess student-writing products. Academic intervention programs such as Imagine  Learning will be purchased for our most struggling student groups and to help target the language and reading  acquisition needs of our ESL, bilingual, and SWD students. School leaders and teacher teams will collaborate to review  data findings from these programs, and will assess level of impact to make instructional adjustments, as needed. The   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      school staff continues to work towards reducing the percent of students performing at Level 1 on the ELA and Math  state exams and increasing percentage of students meeting proficiency levels.   The principal will implement a routine and protocol to review with Assistant Principals and teacher leaders the  outcomes of monitoring activities. This action will be taken to hold all leaders regularly accountable for implementation,  through bi-weekly check-ins with APs and teacher leaders as well as the data tracking of student learning and student  work products.                  What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   Our vision for implementation of CCLS aligned curricula that meets the needs of diverse learners, personally,  academically and culturally revolves around pedagogical practices that incorporate an emphasis on lesson planning,  teacher collaboration, student-centered learning, independent reading, discussion opportunities for students, writing  within all subject areas aligned to Teachers College Reading/Writing units, and use of common CCLS aligned curricula  and rubrics.      Teachers will target the three major learning modalities of students within their lesson planning to provide a common  school-wide Universal Design for Learning (UDL) instructional strategy that provides multiple entry points, ensuring that  each child can access the curricula. The Accountable Talk strategies, Talk Moves, effective questioning, and checks for  understanding will continue to be used as common school-wide instructional practices to promote student-to-student  interactions and a shift towards student-centered learning.       The kind of student-centered instruction that will be integrated into the 2018-2019 school year will include the  following:      Student Discussion Opportunities   o  From Questioning for Classroom Discussion by Jackie Acree Walsh and Beth Dankert Sattes     Questioning and discussion are important means—and ends—of student learning. Research   connects student engagement through questioning and discussion to improved learning  outcomes, including higher levels of thinking and increases in student achievement (Applebee  et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2009). Furthermore, the skills of questioning and discussion are  valuable in and of themselves. Employers report that they are important to career success  (Wagner, 2008), college professors tout their value in the academic environment (Conley, 2008;  Graff, 2003), and which of us would not agree that discussion and critical thinking skills are keys  to active citizenship in our democratic society?     Questioning and discussion work in tandem to move students from passive participants to   active meaning makers. Acknowledgment of the interdependent nature of these two skills can  be found in the new state standards and in teacher evaluation rubrics. Advocates for an  increased focus on questioning and discussion argue that these skills support critical thinking  and collaborative problem solving (Schmoker, 2006; Wagner, 2010).     Group Work   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19      o  From Handbook for Classroom Management That Works by Robert J. Marzano, Barbara B. Gaddy, Maria   C. Foseid, Mark P. Foseid and Jana S. Marzano     Cooperative learning and other group activities can be effective classroom instructional   strategies, not only academically but also as ways to develop students' relationships with one  another. By working with their peers, students can learn to express themselves clearly, to listen,  to compromise, to value others, and to take leadership roles.     Project Based Learning   o  From the article What Research Says About … / Project-Based Learning by Jane L. David     The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest  and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem- solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame  worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development  and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience.  Advocates assert that project-based learning helps prepare students for the thinking and  collaboration skills required in the workplace.     Project-based learning creates opportunities for groups of students to investigate meaningful   questions that require them to gather information and think critically. Typical projects present a  problem to solve (How can we reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?); a phenomenon to  investigate (Why do you stay on your skateboard?); a model to design (Create a scale model of  an ideal high school); or a decision to make (Should the school board vote to build a new  school?).    Visual Learning/Hands On   o  From the article: Integrating Learning Styles and Multiple Intelligences by Harvey Silver, Richard Strong   and Matthew Perini      Learning-style theory begins with Carl Jung (1927), who noted major differences in the way  people perceived (sensation versus intuition), the way they made decisions (logical thinking  versus imaginative feelings), and how active or reflective they were while interacting  (extroversion versus introversion). Isabel Myers and Katherine Briggs (1977), who created the  Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and founded the Association of Psychological Type, applied Jung's  work and influenced a generation of researchers trying to understand specific differences in  human learning. Key researchers in this area include Anthony Gregorc (1985), Kathleen Butler  (1984), Bernice McCarthy (1982), and Harvey Silver and J. Robert Hanson (1995). Although  learning-style theorists interpret the personality in various ways, nearly all models have two  things in common:     A focus on process-Learning-style models tend to concern themselves with the process of  learning which includes: how individuals absorb information, think about information, and  evaluate the results.     An emphasis on personality- Learning-style theorists generally believe that learning is the result      of a personal, individualized act of thought and feeling.  Learning styles are not fixed throughout life, but develop as a person learns and grows. Our  approximate breakdown of the percentages of people with strengths in each style is as follows:  Mastery, 35 percent; Understanding, 18 percent; Self-Expressive, 12 percent; and Interpersonal,  35 percent (Silver and Strong 1997).     Most learning-style advocates would agree that all individuals develop and practice a mixture of   styles as they live and learn. Most people's styles flex and adapt to various contexts, though to  differing degrees. In fact, most people seek a sense of wholeness by practicing all four styles to  some degree. Educators should help students discover their unique profiles, as well as a balance  of styles   District 11 Equity & Excellence Focus:      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          20         Leaders of Tomorrow will be creating an Equity Team to continue to develop initiatives which target the academic and  socio-emotional needs of our boys of color.

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   Our vision for delivery of instruction aligned to setting up students for success is through the development and  integration of pedagogical practices that allow for students to become more self-sufficient in their own learning. To  achieve this, we are promoting a push for instruction and learning opportunities that provide our young scholars with  multiple-entry points to access the lessons, targeting our diverse student body and their personal, socio-emotional, and  academic needs.

How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?  At Leaders of Tomorrow we believe that the ‘re-branding’ of our school through multiple PBIS initiatives will support our  school in continuing our positive movement towards creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for all our  students. The school leaders also believe that outside partnerships are critical for bringing in various programs, services,  enrichments, and support staff to meet the needs and interests of our students.   Currently the school has partnerships with Phipps Neighborhoods, Astor Services for Children & Family, Leadership  Program, Teacher Leadership Initiative, New York Hall of Science, Ramapo, Creative Connections, Urban Advantage, The  Arthor Project, Learning Partners, and Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) that it will be continuing into next year.  We also currently have a School Improvement Grant (SIG) which has helped us to bring in some of these critical  partnerships into our school community.   Student voice and leadership is supported through our partnerships with our CBOs. The Leadership Program provides a  leadership skills program for our scholars. A debate team has also been created through our partnership with MSQI and  our students have competed in debates and have won trophies. School leaders have also developed a Student Council  that will continue to promote students having a voice in PBIS initiatives at the school.    School leaders in collaboration with the CBO will make student achievement and attendance focus goals for the 2018- 2019 school year. The school expects to meet our new attendance and student achievement benchmarks for the 2018- 2019 school year.   Our PBIS team and staff for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to integrate a school-wide PBIS behavior matrix.  The matrix will be used to set clear expectations for all staff and students regarding behavior and building a positive  learning culture and environment. Teachers and students will align to the high expectations outlined within the matrix.  Our CBO will help to support us in determining community educators / partners to support a collaborative teaching  approach regarding our PBIS initiatives, as needed.

School safety officers  and staff will support and promote our PBIS initiatives, to create a welcoming environment for all. School leaders, staff,  our Parent Coordinator, and our CBO will collaborate to provide supports to families so that they understand and can  take an active role in their child’s academic and socio-emotional development.   The school leaders, Parent Coordinator, and CBO Director will collaborate to engage the community and families by  developing interest surveys to gather data for development workshops, informational sessions, and parent/family  support services based on the needs and interests of our parents, to increase parent involvement and engagement. We  will also continue to use a variety of communication sources to keep our parents and community informed of all school  events (newsletter, calls, emails, REMIND app, and socio-media). Parents will also be able to learn about their children  and their learning through the integration of student-led Parent/Teacher conferences.    Our CBO and Parent Coordinator will collaborate to help us to find effective ways to partner with families to support  student success. School leaders will ensure that there is a dedicated space for the CBO and for families within the school  building. Our CBO will also help us to gather information from our parents on programs, workshops, trainings, and  services they would like to engage in that increase parent involvement within our school community.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks.

At the start of the 2018-2019 school year, the principal will delegate specific responsibilities to the Assistant Principals,  Community School Director, Parent Coordinator, and lead teachers and will then hold them accountable for their  responsibilities aligned to developing systems to share academic, behavioral, and attendance data with staff so that  strategies can be created and assessed to support student growth throughout the school year.           On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?     As a new school leader of a Renewal year 4 school, it will be critical to focus on establishing very clear expectations and  building capacity within an integrated staff.          What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   RSCEP goals, an Instructional Focus, an Equity goal, Vision, and Mission statements have been drafted and are in place  for Leaders of Tomorrow and will continue to be improved upon by order to clarify the vision, mission, instructional  focus, and expectations for the upcoming 2018-2019 school year.            What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Leaders of Tomorrow will have a Dean in the upcoming school year. The school will also have teacher leaders in the  form of Model teachers, Peer Collaborative teacher, Emerging Teacher Leaders, and a UFT Center coach to build a  broader leadership capacity within our school. These leaders will meet on the Cultural and/or Instructional Leadership  Teams to refine school practices and ensure that consistent expectations are established and communicated.         2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          40      How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          67     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          68      funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Leaders of Tomorrow, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s PIP  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Leaders of Tomorrow will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          70      ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● School has shared the new ELT mandates and school schedules with parents;   ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Fountas and Pinnell assessment are used to determine if students struggle with decoding , comprehension, or both.  The  NYSITELL and Spanish Lab are also given to newcomers. These assessments provide us with data regarding early literacy skills  in reading, writing, and listening skills in English and Spanish. All students are required to complete the IReady diagnostic. The  diagnostic provides the teachers with a Lexile level as well as data on areas of  strength and weakness with regard to literacy  skills.  On average, our ELLs are reading approximately five years below grade level. In response to this data, we have  scheduled time within the school day and during Extended Learning Time to address common misconceptions and provide  remediation.  Both Myon and LightSail curate a lexically appropriate selection of books based on student interests. Students  are encouraged to access this digital library from home. This initiative produces real time data as students read and answer  selected response questions. IReady allows teachers to assign tasks based on the level students are at Additionally, we have  enhanced our physical book collection to include high interest , lower Lexile texts  that less proficient speakers can access.  ENL   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          83      specialists'  also access the data to differentiate  instructional content, process and product to meet the language demands of  content curriculum.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Data is disseminated and shared during Teacher Team, Departmental/Grade Level, and Professional Learning  sessions.   Teacher teams meet one to two periods a week. These periods are programmed into STARS as CP. Teachers also  plan via email and the use of Google folders for sharing information. All ENL teachers are part of a departmental inquiry team  as well. Weekly departmental meetings also provide opportunities for staff to collaborate on how to meet the needs of the our  students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The primary measure of success is the performance levels on the NYSESLAT. The school evaluates the success of ELLS by  analyzing Exam History reports. Data patterns indicate that the majority of our students are either at Entering/Emerging or  Expanding Levels. We have very few Transitional students. Most of our students struggled with the reading and writing  component of the NYSESLAT. We believe it was due to lack of preparation to the new testing format. For example in order to  be successful in the reading comprehension  students must have knowledge of specific academic vocabulary .  Students need  to be engaged in ongoing activities that promoted the acquisition of content specific vocabulary At least three times a year we  evaluate  students' portfolios and grades  to measure the overall performance of ELLs.  Qualitative data and quantitative  data derived from teacher observations and teacher-made summative assessments also show student growth and can attest  to program effectiveness. . Test data is used to identify long-term ELLs who persistently perform below grade level or have not  demonstrated competence in core subject areas.  All teachers are advised to implement customized Tier 2 interventions to  promote language acquisition for developing ELLs (4-6 years in NYC).     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?     The data guides decisions around professional learning as well as informs teachers instructional decisions. Students are  provided with explicit instructional experiences that develop comprehension, fluency, phonics skills, vocabulary, close reading  skills, and essay writing. data analysis is ongoing and conducted   during departmental and grade team meetings.Through the  use of  Skedula, an in-house grade-book teachers document the progress they observe and gather from formative and  summative  assessments. Based on the data teachers modify and/or adapt instructional materials to meet students'  immediate needs. The school also uses data from periodic assessments to determine which students will benefit from  additional instruction during the school day and Extended Learning Time as a form of academic intervention. The ENL  department compiles a master data list with all students data in order to monitor longitudinal growth.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Students are screened for RTI through Iready and DRP assessments. Teachers examine  the  indicators such as phonological  awareness, letter knowledge, sight words, vocabulary development, and comprehension. Based on the screening process  students who qualify for RTI services currently receive instruction through the following programs: Wilson, Rewards, and Just  Words.  Assessment of student growth in these programs is ongoing. Students will also be readministered the DRP and  Iready diagnostic in January to determine overall growth.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data suggests that it can take as long as seven years to achieve native-like English language proficiency. An analysis of the  different modalities indicates that competence in speaking often emerges sooner than writing and listening skills.  Data  patterns also demonstrate that, year over year, our English Language Learners tend to increase their performance on the  NYSESLAT. This information is discussed at grade and/or content area meetings to view how instruction will be targeted to  raise performance in reading, writing and listening.  ELL students up to intermediate level are placed in a class and those  intermediate and above are programmed in a a different class. Both classes have the benefit of two teachers along with the  ESL service provider.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          84           Based on 2017 NYSESLAT scores most Emerging students increased to a transitioning level. While the majority of our 6th grade  expanding students remained flat for the second year. For the 2017 ELA exam students at entering and emerging levels  made  the least gains. ( city wide 0-10%). The majority of these students never took the ELA test so they show no growth.  According  to our math assessment data the majority of incoming 7th and 8th graders are scoring between 1.88-1.98.  the intermediate to  expanding students are continuing to outperform the entering to transitioning subgroup on this exam.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   All teachers of ELLs know the level of language development of each student  from the RLAT and RSFE that are distributed and  explained during the professional development session at the beginning of each school year. Teachers use the language levels  to group students, provide modified tasks that are rigorous, and set language objectives that develop students' literacy  through content. Teachers have access to a wide range of instructional materials  and technology that support whole class,  small group, and individualized instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Integrated co-teaching is a heterogeneous block class where the ENL teacher “pushes in.”  One unit of ENL study (180  minutes), taught by the TESOL certified teacher, is provided to homogeneous groups in order to develop English  language skills. The homogeneous ENL stand alone groups can contain no more than two contiguous grades (i.e. 6th  and 7th grade or 7th and 8th, but not 6th and 8th).Students are grouped by grade and proficiency level to the extent  possible . All classes are departmentalized and students move from class to class with their peers. During the  standalone periods students receive instruction in all four modalities with an emphases on the ELA curriculum. the  standalone period is also used to develop students academic vocabulary skills for all content areas. During integrated  periods students remain with their class but receive instruction that is scaffolded to meet their needs while still  maintaining academic rigor. Teachers also infuse a language objective into the lessons in order to support students  continued development of grammar and grammatical structures.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not Applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Two units of study per week (180 minutes or four 45 minute periods) of integrated ELA (by an ELA teacher and the ENL  teacher) provided to every ELL student alongside English proficient peers, in accordance with CR Part 154. Entering (beginning)  and Emerging (low-intermediate) students receive an additional two units in standalone ENL instruction with home language  supports for a total of 360 minutes. Freestanding ENL is delivered in conjunction with the current ELA curriculum and focuses  on all four modalities. Students also receive instruction in academic vocabulary that is necessary for them to be successful in   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85      all content area classes. . During this class students receive scaffolded instruction that supports their learning. Students who  recently achieved the proficiency level of commanding receive an additional 2 years of integrated ENL support in ELA classes.  All students are programmed into STARS at the start of the school year and accuracy is maintained through the monthly  EDUR report.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Freestanding ENL: Bloom’s Taxonomy or Depth of Knowledge is used to modify and fine-tune cognitively demanding and  context-reduced tasks and assessments, such as essays or exams. Instructional scaffolds (such as graphic organizers and  sentence stems) are used to expand students' Zones of Proximal Development to make standard-align lesson objectives,  materials and activities accessible to ELL students.  Other programs implemented in the ENL classroom include LightSail,  Language Power, Duolingo, Brainpop, and the use of Ipads. Content and ENL teachers are encouraged to plan cooperatively to  the extent possible during common planning periods. All teachers participate in weekly Data Wise meetings to examine  student work and improve overall instructional practices. When necessary students are provided with materials in their native  language. Students also have access to technology that allows them to translate materials on their own.  Instruction is  conducted in English .     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   To the extent possible and in language spoken by our staff, the initial evaluation is based on an informal interview process.  Students whose native language is Spanish are evaluated with the Spanish LAB. Throughout the year, students will be tasked  with transliterating and summarizing texts written in their home language to English and from English to the home language as  an informal formative exercise that will build fluency and inform the ENL teacher about the type of supports that a  student requires for the development of English language proficiency.    Spanish-speakers take a more formal assessment every Spring in the form of the ELE, a Spanish-language literacy assessment.  On state exams, like the annual NYS Math exam, RELC reports are inspected to determine home language. More proficient  students are given the option to take these exams in their home language or receive interpretation from a translator.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE - The reduction and replacement of complex lexical items in text. Reduction in textual length. Differentiation  of  assessments, content and instructional process.    Newcomer - The incorporation of visuals and translations into the students’ home language. Differentiation of product and  process. Teachers are encouraged to promote peer collaboration with ample opportunities for ELLs to practice using target  language.    Developing - Flexible/Heterogeneous groups in content classrooms to facilitate collaboration with more proficient peers. Pre- teaching cognitive and academic vocabulary before introducing it in context. Footnotes in text. Materials are differentiated  depending on individual student needs. Literacy and language needs by modality are assessed at the beginning of the school  year and are reevaluated quarterly in order to adjust instruction    Long Term - Explicit instruction pertaining to strategies such as identifying cognates and looking for contextual clues.    Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status - Scaffolds will be tied to the students greatest area of opportunity within  the four language arts modalities. Focus on writing and constructed response supports (i.e. exemplars and rubrics). Students   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          86      are placed in classes that appropriately support their needs and receive .5 units of support from a certified ENL teacher .  Students continue to receive testing accommodations as well.    All students are invited to attend various Title III supplemental programs throughout the year.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ELL/SWD students follow the  Teachers College Readers/Writers Workshop ELA curriculum  with appropriate scaffolds. IEP  Teachers review students individual education plan and assure they are receiving the recommended services as per their  IEP.  Teachers of ELL/SWD use a variety of strategies and grade level materials that support  language acquisition.  Appropriate scaffolds include graphic organizers, visuals, native language supports, read alouds,  comprehension strategies, decoding strategies,digital programs, audio books via myOn/Lightsail and dictionaries. These  scaffolds  are  utilized to accelerate language development.    The school currently uses the "Keys to Learning" ENL program in the self-contained classes features in our Freestanding ENL  program. We have dictionaries in English-Spanish, English-Arabic, and English-French. In addition, ELLs can use a laptops or  digital tablets to access electronic translation (i.e. Google Translate) for assignments and to make instructional input  comprehensible. For content areas, key vocabulary instruction is given in the students' home language.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Atlas curriculum is used school-wide. Atlas is a digital curriculum development platform in which teachers can share  modifications they have created. Special educators also have time to plan with the ENL teacher to determine what are the  ways to effectively differentiate instructional content, classroom activities and demonstrations of student learning for students  with limited English proficiency and an IEP. The ENL teacher also has the discretion to “flex” in his schedule to assist special  educators when the content-specific language demands far exceed student’s level of English comprehension. This ensures that  ELL students can get access to standard-aligned curriculum alongside their non-disabled and English proficient peers. ENL  Teachers are involved in setting developmentally appropriate IEP goals.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The school provides "Extended Learning Time" for students in English.  During that time students work in small groups with  teachers. Teachers look at data of student work in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies. They give extra support during  9th   period; and academic intervention during the school day to support language development.  Students receive small group  and guided instruction and are provided with supportive materials such as digital books, dual language articles, and translation  glossaries.  This allows for a  more direct and personalized instruction. Ongoing assessment is conducted during weekly Data  Wise team meetings.    Consistent iReady assessments is built-in to student programs to create a dynamic picture of what students can read in terms  of lexical complexity.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Teachers College Writing Workshop used for the 2017-2018 school year will include more linguistically appropriate texts for  newcomer ELLs to engage with. A class set of iPads will also be used to help the least English proficient students translate texts  and make meaning in real-time. The school will also be using the MSQI toolbox to support students in becoming good readers.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All programs and services currently in use with ELLs are expected to continue.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          87         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. They have technology to research and write reports, they use interactive  programs such as BrainPop, Iready, MyOn, and Lightsail. They receive awards during monthly assemblies celebrations as the  school acknowledges all students successes and awards.       ELLs participate in all of the school pre and after-school programs, including RTI, extended learning time (a requirement),  intramural sports and homework help. All ELLs and Former ELLs are invited to attend a supplemental program. The program  begins November 5 and ends January 27. Twenty- nine students have enrolled and two teachers are facilitating the program.  To the extent possible, students are grouped by sub-group (e.g., SIFE, and ELLs with special needs, beginners). Allclasses are  conducted in English with native language support via bilingual dictionaries and native languagelibraries. All students in the  program use technology (ipads and laptops). Ipad use includes various applications: voice recording, speech to text, text to  speech, spelling, reading and visual representations.Additional materials used to support English Language Learners are:  Duolingo, Brain Pop, Iready, Myon,Finish Line NYSESLAT 2017 test preparation books, Word Power, Saddleback ELL Teen  Literacy, and  leveled instructional texts for social studies and science.    Also,  This year all  ELL students will participate in our roll-out  of Student- Led conferences. We inform ELLs and their parents about  the different programs at enrollment and to accelerate English language development and prepared for the NYSESLAT test.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teachers use Ready books for ELA and Math.  Students use blended learning with myOn.  Students take assessments to start  reading the technology-digital reading program.   myOn incorporates all content areas through access to different books while  tracking students reading time and built-in reading activities.  Students are able to select books from many different genres  and of interest to them.  Spanish speaking students are able to select books in Spanish, Spanish and English or English  only.  They can use audio to read, listen and hear proper enunciation and pacing of stories.   Students also use IReady to  support literacy development. through ongoing growth monitoring teachers are able to assign tasks that address areas of  need.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language libraries, dictionaries, and glossaries are available to support instruction. Students also have access to  technology that allows them to translate documents. teachers use resources in students beginning languages for beginning  readers. Parents and students have access to a grading/reporting system--Skedula. They can access students grades,  attendance and anecdotals from teachers in their home language.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Students receive instruction in English according to their level of language proficiency.  The data is kept up to date with  information of incoming students and their scores.  Extra time, separate location, directions read aloud and dictionaries, as  well as interpreters are used for students who are identified as ELLs.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Not applicable.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          88         Newcomers are tested and placed using NYSITELL and Spanish Lab, when applicable.  The students classroom placement  depends on their level of proficiency. Each parent and student has an informal meeting with an ENL teacher to highlight special  programs at our school including our after school program. The school has an open-house in March for incoming 6   th   graders, an enrichment program in July, and an orientation in late August.  During the orientation information is made  available to parents in Spanish, French and Arabic from the NYCDOE.  The main office is staffed with Spanish speakers to assist  in the filing out of forms and answer school-based questions.  During the school year in November, the ENL teachers sponsors  a multicultural luncheon for and by parents of ELLs.  The event introduces all students to each other and to the staff and  students give a brief introduction of where they are from and the food they brought in.   In September/October a multicultural  presentation is done with the ENL teachers, math teacher, physical education, school counselors, assistant principals, principal,  parent coordinator and other staff.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?   The language offered as a course is Spanish.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  With a large population of ELLs, we feel the need to support our teachers with on-  going training. Our in-house ENL coordinator and teachers attend outside training and turn-key  the information following each workshop. According to Mandate CR Part 154, all teachers must receive 15%  of their total professional development hours in topics specific to the needs of English language learners.  This means that teachers must receive approximately three hours of ENL PD yearly. All teachers in school  attend several ENL workshops a year, these are organized and facilitated by Ms. Oliveri, Sabrina Romano  (MSQI Coach), UFT (Maria Ellan Guzman), and Mr. Veras. These sessions will take place during our  Monday and Tuesday Professional Learning time and during the teachers' contractual work day at no cost  to the program. The topics this year include but are not limited to:  :  September 5- ELL Strategies and Proficiency Level Descriptors-All Teachers/Paraprofessionals  September 28- MSQI Strategies for ELLS in Reading -Close reading- ELA Department  October 30- Scafolding for ELLs in all Content Areas-All Teachers/Paraprofessionals  October 12-MSQI- Confering with ELL students-ELA Teachers  December 4 & 11- UFT Teacher Center Coteaching and planning- The presenters will focus on models of  coteaching for ELL and Content Area teachers.

Teachers volunteer to sign up for various opportunities. Common  planning during the school day has been put into each teacher's program to ensure collaborative planning,  and to analyze student work to determine appropriate reading and writing interventions for ELLs.Bilingual  staff and teachers are offered training to provide new student and parent orientations along with SIFE  interviews.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  According to Mandate CR Part 154, all teachers must receive 15%  of their total professional development hours in topics specific to the needs of English language learners.  This means that teachers must receive approximately three hours of ENL PD yearly. All teachers in school  attend several ENL workshops a year, these are organized and facilitated by Ms. Oliveri, Sabrina Romano  (MSQI Coach), UFT (Maria Ellan Guzman), and Mr. Veras. These sessions will take place during our  Monday and Tuesday Professional Learning time and during the teachers' contractual work day at no cost  to the program.       Agendas  and PD materials  are maintained in a Google folder that is accessible to all staff.  Attendance sheets are kept in a  binder.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers maintain a checklist to track the scheduling and attainment of the one-on-one parent meetings. meetings held  with the parents of students entitled to ELL services. Teachers are informed about parent visits to school and schedule one-on- one meetings strategically to leverage parents' presence in the school and maximize attendance/participation. The  meeting times as well as the duration of individual meetings are documented in Skedula.      During the meetings, teachers reiterate the goals of the standalone ENL program available at 11X370 (teachers are introduce  the program during initial orientation, briefly in re/entitlement letters as well as after collecting the information needed to  complete Home Language Identification surveys). Teachers make reference to Skedula quantitative data as well as teacher  notes and anecdotes are during the meetings. Students' individualized SMART goals are also referenced and progress is  communicated to parents. As stakeholders in their own linguistic development, Students are encouraged to appraise their  progress toward these unique goals. In the event that parents or guardians are not English proficient or would prefer to  communicate in language other than English, Translation and interpretations are provided through the Office of Interpretation  Service.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   With an ever-increasing ESL population, communicating with families is a challenge. However, we believe  that parents should play an active role in their child's education regardless of their language barrier. Use of  Doe Translation Services is essential to maintaining contact with parents of varied languages.    Below is a list of activities that Leaders of Tomorrow offers to ensure greater parent engagement in our  school community. These activities take pleace during the contractual day.  The Parent Coordinator, Ms. Smith , conducts monthly meetings and/or workshops, providing translation  when needed. Notice of meetings are sent via phone blasts, Remind App, and backpack letters. Topics vary   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          90         from month to month and are based on community demand as well as issues that effect the  social/emotional development of adoloescent children.  Phone blast, Rewind App, and backpack letters are sent out to all families providing notifications of  upcoming events.  New immigrant parents will receive a information and instructions to help them to get their families  started in a new country and school community.  A “Parent Library” is available for parents (via our Parent Coordinator).  Warrior Parents support group meets monthly. This group is target towards parents of students with  disabilities and includes those who are among our ELL community as well.  Targeted audience workshops for parents of students with disabilities and ELLs regarding Student Lead  Conferences.  Translators are contracted as needed through Legal Interpretation Services. This service is on-going  (available during all PTA meetings, Parent Orientation Night, and Parent-Teacher conferences).  Pupil Path training is also provided on a one-to-one level when requested (also through our Parent  Coordinator).  Monthly PTA meetings encourage parent participation in school events (i.e. fund raising, chaperoning  school dances, class trips, etc.).  A Mutlticultural Potluck Dinner will take place on November 9 from 4:30-6:30  Our CBO, PHIPPS, also provides support for our ELLs as mentors during the school day and by providing  Part D: Parental Engagement Activities  afterschool programs and trips.  Parent Needs are determined by: Surveys, personal requests, meetings and through email. Surveys are  analyzed by the SLT and school's Academic Leadership Team. Changes are made based on survey  outcomes.  English language classes are offered to assist parents in learning English in order to overcome language  barriers.  Monthly PTA meetings reflect topics requested by parents. For example most recently parents requested  a discussion regarding bullying.  High school workshops (given by our school guidance counselors) assist families in choosing the best High  School. Depending on the needs they are oriented on a one to one basis (with translation when requested).  We also maintain parent communication through the following (with translation): • Pupil Path • Backpack  notices and emails • Parent Coordinator bulletin board • High School Application Orientation • Telephone  Message System.  Teachers are provided 40 minutes to conduct the following: meetings with parents, telephone conferences  and or drafting correspondence to parents. These minutes are also used to conduct additional ENL parent  meetings.    Where applicable agendas are housed in our school Google Meetings folder and attendance sheets are placed in a binder.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sean Licata, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          93                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
