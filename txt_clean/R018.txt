This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview         Vision Statement   The Vision of Public School 18 is to develop a school that is highly regarded for its academic excellence, attention to  technology in education, and for its contributions to developing strong community ties. We do this by providing our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      students with standards based rigorous instruction. Students take ownership of their learning in a safe and supportive  environment.      Mission Statement   The mission of Public School 18 is to provide each student with the basic foundation for their future and each parent  with the support needed to help realize this goal. Using research-based classroom methodologies and a framework  that fosters positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS), we seek to educate the whole child academically,  socially, and emotionally. We aim to develop curious and enthusiastic learners and equip them with the tools needed  to thrive as independent citizens.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    In an effort to ensure that we are on the road to meeting our vision and mission, we have recently equipped all  classrooms with state of the art smart boards to ensure technology is used to support students and classroom  instruction. Additionally, all classrooms have computers/ laptops with printers to ensure that students have resources  to enhance their learning.      Public School 18 seeks to achieve its vision by living out our mission statement in collaboration with the school  community, parents, and the following partnerships:   *United Activities Unlimited/ UAU--Beacon & Cornerstone   *Reading Rescue   *Literacy Link   *Reading Partners      Our ELA data (26.9% in levels 3 & 4) reflects the need to strengthen literacy skills across all grades. As a result, the  partnerships that we have with Reading Rescue and Literacy Link helps us to strengthen foundational skills for our  younger students (primarily 1st and 2nd graders). Through the utilization of tutors (teachers and students), we strive  to improve the reading capabilities of our struggling students.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 18R is a pre-K through 5th grade school located in the West Brighton section of Staten Island, New York. Our  diverse student population encompasses 43% Hispanic, 46% Black, 4% White, 5% Asian, and 2% other. Students with  special needs comprise 34% and ENL’s account for 7% of our student population.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which P.S. 18 has made the most progress was Collaborative  Teachers. We ensured that teachers are given opportunities in collaborative conversations around curriculum,  student data and progress. Teachers are given a handbook that outlined protocols to follow. Teachers meet regularly  in grade level teams to look at curriculum, look at data, and track targeted groups. This process has allowed teachers  to better understand the cycles of collaborative inquiry and the purpose of the work. Teachers discussed specific  students, look at practices and shared resources.      A key area of focus for this year is continuing to make purposeful decisions to ensure that curricula are Common Core  aligned thus promoting college and career readiness for all learners via the Collaborative Teachers framework for  great schools. The school will continue to make curricula adjustments and modifications to ensure that all student  needs are met and that tasks cognitively engage all learners. School leaders and teachers will ensure that the units of  studies are responsive to student data, inclusive of strategies for at risk students, with greater focus on vocabulary  given the large population of Special Ed Students (36%), and following the Understand by Design (UBD) model.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R018   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   573   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted. The following summative assessments were used.   * New York State Standardized 2018 Test results in English Language Arts (ELA)   * Student Work protocol analysis   * Classroom Observations   * PPO 2017-2018      The Principal's Performance Observation of 2017-18 reveal that P.S. 18's areas of celebrations were around rigorous  instruction--1.1 and 2.2. P.S. 18 uses common core aligned curricula to promote all students as critical thinkers  through a well-paced and inclusive curriculum. Through the curricular lenses of ReadyGen and GoMath, teachers  design and implement curricula which emphasizes tiered activities, student centered rubrics, and authentic student  work portfolios. Data from interim assessments, running records, performance based assessments in ELA and Math,  on demand writing benchmarks, and much more were use to further support and enhance our work.      Despite our strength in 1.1 and 2.2, the PPO 2017-2018 also reveal that the area of concentration for the school was  the following:   1.2 Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of  all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products.       As a result, we will continue to use City-wide suggested curricula in ELA (ReadyGen) and Math that have been aligned  to the CCLS. As a school, we will continue to focus on providing students with access to complex materials (grade level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      lessons and concepts ) along with the appropriate scaffolding to meet their needs. We need to ensure that we  continue to develop curricula and differentiation practices across the school; we also need to strengthen teacher  practice so that students are provided with multiple entry points, and higher order learning opportunities. One area  of strength in this element of the Framework in our school is the fact that we have planned yearlong units of studies  to support teacher development in this area. We have also aligned many of our goals and school activities to  Component 3C--Engaging Students in Learning. We will be engaging students in a balanced approach to learning with  a focus on meaningful tasks. We will continue to focus on additional professional development opportunities to  ensure teachers shift practice and develop a repertoire of strategies as it relates to planning rigorous instruction.  Additionally, study groups will focus on aligning data to small group instruction and planning engaging and meaningful  activities to maximize differentiated instruction.      Although we had an increase of 2% in ELA, an analysis of student data revealed that our students’ ELA scores were not  comparable to the level of sophistication required to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  This need was identified by analyzing the item analysis reports of the 2017-18 NYS ELA Assessment (35.1% scored a  level 3 or 4 in comparison to 32% in 2016 - 2017. There are several learning gaps presented by the analysis of the  data:   1) Determining Vocabulary Meaning--3.RL.4; 4.RL4; 4.RI.4   2) Comparing and Contrasting Structure--3.RL.6; 5.RL.5   3) Synthesizing Information--4.RI.3; 4.RI.5; 5.RI.3, 5.RI.6; 5.RI.7   4) Determining Main Idea/ Theme--4.RL2      The learning gaps will be addressed by grade level through meaningful planning that provides opportunities for higher  order thinking through grade level appropriate tasks/ activities. The Instructional Cabinet Team will monitor planning  and identify specific grade level needs.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, as a result of teachers in grades 4-5 aligning assessments to curricula, analyzing assessments, and  adjusting instruction to improve outcomes, there will be a 4% increase (35% to 39%) in the percentage of students  scoring a level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Exam as measured by the results of the 2019 ELA Assessment Results.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  As a kickoff to the year, we hold a Back to School Kick-Off Celebration with Data Talk (Summary of ELA/ and Math  Trends) that focuses on ensuring that parents are well-versed around Rigorous Instruction, Utilization of Parent  Engagement Time, etc. Parents are introduced to the many family engagement activities that they can participate  throughout the course of the year in this kick-off activity.      Parent Workshops and Informational Sessions will be pivotal in increasing family engagement. Parent Workshops and  Parent Engagement Time will be scheduled weekly to help parents develop a comprehensive understanding of the  Common Core Learning Standards and expectations. Key personnel responsible for tracking and monitoring  attendance to weekly parent workshops and parent engagement time activities will be Administration, and the Parent  Coordinator (Mr. Salvador Schembri).

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     The PPO revealed that one of P.S. 18's areas of celebrations were around School Culture--3.4. P.S. 18 has established a  culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provide supports to  achieve those expectations.       Despite the area of celebration noted on the Quality Review, the Learning Environment Survey for the 2016-2017  challenges that notion. As per teachers’ percentage for positive responses for Classroom Behavior, 57% of teachers  identified classroom behavior as an area of concern for the school. We recognize the need to educate the whole child  by ensuring that we monitor and track their well being and their social and emotional growth. We will continue to  implement PBIS strategies and procedures as a support of the social and emotional growth of our students.  Throughout the school year, we will use the established PBIS matrix and OORS data to monitor students’ social- emotional development and ensure academic success. We will also participate and turnkey many of the best practices  from the SIBFSC learning opportunities, such as Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools and PBIS to teachers so  that they can incorporate those practices into their classrooms.      A strength in this area is the fact that teachers are keeping anecdotal notes in an effort to report infractions. This  process is important as it allows us to truly understand the social and emotional needs of our students. We are in the  process of developing a school wide anecdotal form.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, as a result of a school wide implementation of Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS), there will  be a 20% decrease (from 167 to 133 Level 1-5 incidents) in K to 5th grade student infractions/ violations to the  Discipline Code as measured by the results of the 2018-2019 Level 1-5 Incident & Suspension Report (OORS).         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

OORS data will be used to monitor the social and emotional  growth of targeted students. We will identify behavioral trends  impacting the student population. Throughout the school year,  teachers, the Guidance Team, Peer Leaders, and the  Administrative Team will use the established PBIS matrix and  OORS data (monthly) during safety committee meetings to  monitor students’ social-emotional development and ensure  academic success. (ongoing)   PBIS team will meet to examine pertinent data regarding the  safety and environment of the school. Specific targets will be set  on a month by month basis so that the school community is  made aware of the importance of the program and its impact  upon the entire school community. Overall impact and  effectiveness of programs will be measured by a decrease in  infractions as measured against monthly OORS data. (ongoing)   Monthly assemblies will take place to support the social and  emotional development of students. Assembly programs will be  provided by the Guidance Team.    Meditation and Yoga will be provided on a monthly basis to help  with relaxation and coping strategies for both teachers and  students to incorporate into their lives on a daily basis.   A student council committee, along with PBIS Team and other  staff, will be established to provide student voice for school level  concerns. Student school council will meet on a monthly basis to  help run and maintain school store. Additionally, opportunities  for school based community service (Safety Patrol) will be made  available across the school.   Teachers will attend regularly Field Support Center learning  opportunities to help the school further the social and emotional  well-being of our students. Students will learn how to regulate  their behavior, and teachers will have access to school based  supports to assist in behavior/ emotional escalations.           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The PPO revealed that one of P.S. 18's areas of celebrations were around Systems for Improvement--4.2. Our staff  participate in regularly scheduled collaborative inquiry work using coherent protocols and instructional supports to  build a community of learners focused on student achievement. Through the use of protocols, inter-visitations,  weekly team meetings, teachers collaborate to explore evidence and refine approaches to best reflect high  expectations..       Our strength in this area is that we are using curricula that are aligned to the CCLS and provide student assessments  and additional supports for students via multiple entry points/ universal design for learning. But as evidenced in the  PPO feedback, we need to strengthen our repertoire at providing cognitively appropriate tasks that are aligned to the  day to day learning targets and grade level standards. A clear focused area in collaborative teachers is the need to  ensure that all students including subgroups such as SWD, Blacks, and Economically Disadvantaged are provided with  multiple entry points so that accessibility to learning is available for all subgroups.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, as a result of Impact Team Work with a focus on reading standards for literature and informational text  (craft and structure) there will be a 20% increase (from 40% to 60%) in the percentage of students in grades 4-5 reading  at or above grade level as measured by the 2019 June Instructional Report.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   During weekly Impact Team meetings, teacher teams will use the  protocols of Impact Teams (such as “Looking at Student Work”)  to examine student work products to evaluate their rigor and  adapt instruction (providing multiple entry point/scaffolds) to  impact student achievement.    Teacher teams will meet weekly to evaluate and calibrate  student work to determine a) adjustments needed to instruction;  b) provide students with actionable feedback to increase overall  student achievement; c) and create modifications (multiple entry  points).   Professional Learning opportunities around Core Collaborative  (refining grade/ school formative assessments so that we can  differentiate learning tasks and provide multiple entry points to  instruction) will be provided monthly to the teachers.

Professional Learning will  include Lesson Studies, Co-Teaching, Co-Planning, and Inter- visitations so that teachers can acquire skills that will result in  better planning, differentiation and multiple entry points to  promote student achievement.           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies  to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and  identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  It is important for us to have collaboration with our parents so that students are supported both at home and in  school. As a result, P.S. 18 will:   1) Use Parental Engagement Time (September 2018-June 2019) to foster communication and to help parents  understand the progress their individual children are making. There will be some Tuesday sessions that will consist of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      workshops being led by teachers. Most recently we had our 5th grade team provide parents with a learning session  that focused on understanding how to tackle the Go Math curriculum.   2) In an effort to promote teacher and parent collaboration, we will distribute 3 additional progress reports (October  2018, January 2019, May 2019) throughout the academic year. The progress reports will provide information on  student achievement and will include next steps to improve student outcomes.      Key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight will be Administration and the Parent Coordinator (Mr.  Salvador Schembri).        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a.

Based on Student Register Data, the percentage of Special Education students at P.S. 18 is an area of concern. As a  school community, the SWD population is a subgroup that we always want to pay close attention to due to state  accountability. Last year, 193 students (35.41%) of our student population were SWDs. This year 166 students (33.6%)  of students are SWD's. In addition to having a high percentage of SWD students, our initial referral rate has caused  the school to be identified as a Spotlight School for the district. As a Spotlight school, District 31 will be providing  support so that P.S. 18 can decrease the initial referral rate thus decreasing the percentage of SWD students. We  want to increase the amount of students receiving RTI by providing AIS to students via services provided by three  Academic Intervention Teachers.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Parental Involvement is key to the success of a school. We want to ensure that parents feel informed and welcomed.  Currently, parental involvement during PTA meetings and parent workshops has been low. Although the School  survey shows that 91% of families say that they are likely to attend a general school meeting or school event, data  (attendance sheets) indicate that this is not the case because less than 5% of our parent population attend PTA  meetings/ workshops. We are aiming to change that and increase parental involvement through the use of  technology (apps). We will incorporate communicating with families concerning student achievement using multiple  tools, and in all pertinent languages, in an effort to impact student achievement.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  P.S. 18, for the most part, have a veteran staff. 75% of our faculty have been teaching in this school for a minimum of  10 years. We attribute the high retention rate of our teaching staff to the strong professional development program,  which addresses teacher needs, and strengths, as well as a strong mentoring program. In addition, the Principal and  the Assistant Principal are instrumental in building capacity within the staff. Teachers are afforded opportunities to  chair committees, spearhead new instructional approaches, and conduct primary research on the best teaching  techniques currently available. Lastly, but very important, there is a shared vision among staff that sustains staff  stability.       Regarding teacher assignment, teachers are given a preference sheet at the end of each school year and through  administrator and teacher dialogue, teacher assignments are made. The goal of this process is to ensure that all  teacher assignments are made so that students will most benefit from the teacher's experience, qualifications, and  expertise.      Our partnership with the College of Staten Island (CSI) student teaching program contributes to our recruitment  efforts when we have vacancies. When all else fails, we follow the following guidelines:   ● All recruited teachers will be appropriately certified and highly qualified teachers, with some limited flexibility,  consistent with State regulations.   ● Principal will work closely with the Director of Human Resources so that policies set forth by the DOE for selecting  high qualified teachers follows the guidelines set by the NYS Education Department.   ● The Principal in collaboration with the Borough Field Support Director of Human Resources will work to identify  qualified teachers through major recruitment campaigns, hiring halls and through relationships with Colleges and  Universities.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our professional development activities will include learning sessions focused around Professional Learning  Communities. The PLC series will be aligned to school goals, theory of action, and Advance Data for individual  teachers/ paraprofessionals and groups of teachers/ paraprofessionals. The PLC's will take place every Monday of the  school year; all PLC's will focus on ensuring that we are meeting school goals and that we are all working towards the  theory of action. The second series of PLC's will take place on Tuesday's after the parental engagement block. The  focus of the Tuesday work will be based on teacher needs based on Advance Data. One example of a particular PLC is  the UDL PLC which is being offered to teachers who score developing on component 3C and to all new teachers. The  professional development plan will include opportunities for all teachers/ paraprofessionals based on their current  pedagogue practices and learning needs.      The alignment between the Advance Data and professional learning opportunities will provide us with the ability to  ensure that we shift teacher practice. Shifting teacher practice will ensure that teachers are maximizing instructional  time and that will impact student outcomes. Learning how to align standards with what is being taught, learning how  to effectively provide multiple entry points, and how to differentiate instruction are all focused learning sessions that  will help us impact teacher practice and student outcomes.      The Principal and Assistant Principal regularly attend Field Support Center PD sessions, as well Principal and AP  sessions that are organized by the Superintendent's Team. All professional learning are focused around meeting  school and district goals. One PD series in particular have been the Core Collaborative.           Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        A committee was formed to identify assessments that would be used to determine city and state measures of  performance. The committee was composed of 3 teachers representing all grade levels (K-5) as well as administration  and Teacher Center Coach (3). The committee reviewed assessments identified by the state and city as well as  universal assessments used at the school level. The committee selected from each category to measure student  progress. Through teacher teams, professional development is provided to analyze assessment results listed below in  order to inform instruction.   1) State ELA & Math Results--Item skills analysis   2) New York City Performance (Baseline & Benchmark) Assessments--Individual student's performance   3) Fountas & Pinnell--Miscue analysis to provide conference support to students during independent reading.   4) Go Math Pre & Post (Unit) Tests--Class and individual student testing performance.   5) Periodic ELA Assessments.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 18, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Public School 18 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  All of the data we collect is analyzed and guides our teachers for their next steps with their students.  The NYSITELL data is  used to assess individual student’s needs and drive instruction.  We use Teacher’s College Running Records in Kindergarten  through grade 5.  All students are assessed four times a year.  We use this assessment to determine a student's reading  level.  The data used is from the running records administered during May of 2017.  This data shows us that two of the  kindergarten students are pre-emergent readers and four are reading on a level B.  One of our first grade students is reading  on a level B, one student is reading on a level C, five are reading on a level D, two are reading on a level F, three are reading on  a level H and one is reading on a level M.  In grade two, there are two students reading on a level C, two students reading on a  level F, and one student each on level H, J, L and M.  The third grade has one student on level C, two students each on level F  and I, one student on level K, two students on level L, six students on level M and one student each on level P and Q.  The  fourth grade has two students on level M and one on a level Q.  The fifth grade has one student on each of the following  levels, L, P, R, T and W.  This data shows us that the majority of our ENL students are reading below grade level.  Students will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      be tested again in the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year.  This information is used to group the students for guided  reading and tiered activity instruction.  The students receive direct instruction at that level to improve their reading  ability.  We administer a benchmark assessment in reading and math at the beginning of the school year in all grades.  We also  administer a mid-year and end of year assessment to track student progress.  We use the data collected to inform instruction  and differentiate.  This information drives our instruction.  We use this information to help us to meet the needs of our ENL  students.  We tailor instruction to ensure that our ENL subgroup meets instructional expectations.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have grouped our ENL students, where possible, in the same classroom to maximize the efficiency of our ENL teacher.  Ms.  Nicchio will also be working 6 periods to meet the needs of all of the students in our program.  Two staff members have  attended summer professional development and will be turn keying that information as part of our Monday afternoon  professional learning sessions.  Time is also allocated for the teachers of our ENL students to work with Ms. Nicchio on Monday  afternoons to plan lessons that will provide our ENL students with an instructional program which meets their needs.  Mrs.  Carroll is responsible for making sure all of our ENL students received the mandated instructional time.  Mrs. Carroll is also  responsible for providing teachers with the data they need and analyzing it with the teachers to promote student growth.  Mr.  Rodriguez is responsible for observing Ms. Nicchio to make sure she is providing quality instruction when she works with the  students she pulls out of their classrooms and when she collaborates with a teacher in their classroom.  We also have four AIS  teachers in the building and there are ENL students slated to receive that support.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our program by looking at the movement of our students from entering to  commanding/proficient.   We also closely track the number of students who reach proficiency.  Our students did not make  significant gains on the NYSESLAT last year.  The majority of our students stayed in the same level they were in last year,  particularly transitioning and expanding.  The data indicates the students did not perform to expectation in both the listening  and writing portion of the exam.  This needs to be our area of focus this year.  We also  look at student growth with relation to  their running records.  Students are tested four times a year using the Teacher's College Running Record system.  We are  looking for them to ultimately receive grade level proficiency according to that system.  Currently, we do not have enough  students in the 3rd through 5th grade to form a sub-group for ENLs. Because of this, we do not have an AYP goal for our ENL  population.  The results of the NYSESLAT help us to analyze the success of our program and modify instruction.  We use this  data to support our students and create a program which helps them move from entering to emerging, transitional, expanding  and finally commanding/proficient.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have grade level inquiry meetings to discuss trends in each grade.  Our AIS team also meets regularly to discuss the  progress of all students.  Our ENL teacher regularly participates in these meetings and is responsible for tracking the progress  of our ENL students.  Speech and AIS teachers work along side our classroom teachers to provide remediation to our students  during 3rd period small group instruction,.  First grade students also participate in the reading rescue program which provides  one on one support to our neediest students.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We have focused on strengthening our core instruction for our ENL population.  We have placed them in the same classroom  by grade and scheduled the ENL teacher to push in to work with her students.  The instructional core has been tailored to  meet the needs of our ENL learners in that classroom.  Language development is fostered at all levels through purposeful,  deliberate conversation between the teachers and students, and among students. Reading and writing is stressed and is taught  as specific curricula, and integrated into each content area.   The focus is on building students’ abilities to form, express, and  exchange ideas through dialogue, questioning, and sharing ideas and knowledge.  In these instructional conversations, the  teachers listen carefully, makes guesses about intended meaning, and adjusts responses to assist students’ efforts.  Progress  monitoring is achieved through administering the Teacher's College Running Record four times during the school year.  The  teachers also track student progress through the benchmark assessment administered in reading and math at the beginning,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         middle and end of the year.  Teachers also use end of unit assessments in reading and math to track student progress.  The  school analyzes data and students who are in need of Academic Intervention Services receive those services through our  speech teachers and the four AIS providers.  The school provides service to all students in grades K - 5 who are in need of  support to increase their reading proficiency.    Tier one intervention is provided by the classroom teacher through guided  reading, strategy lessons and Fundations instruction.  Tier two intervention is provided in small groups through our AIS  program.  Tier three instruction is provided to our students who are very delayed though Orton Gillingham instruction  provided individually by specific classroom teachers, speech and AIS teachers.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Both summative and Formative data is used to assess our ENL students.  The NYSITELL data is the information we use to decide  which students will be part of our ENL program.  We have seen a trend of students benefiting from participating in our PreK  program.  These students are not eligible because of the immersion in an English speaking PreK environment and our focus on  language development through discussions.  The LAP team identified a number of patterns in student's results.  Writing is  consistently an area of weakness for our ENL population with reading being the next area of concern.  This year we have also  seen an increase in the number of students not making gains in the listening portion of the exam.  A majority of our ENL  students are currently reading below the benchmark for their grade but there has been improvement toward reaching grade  level proficiency.  This data is gathered through the administration of Teacher's College Running Records.  The strengths of our  students was speaking.  This was consistent across the grades.  This information guides our instructional decisions.  The  teachers evaluate the data for their students to assess what each child needs to improve.  We evaluate the success of our ENL  program by not only looking at the test results but through the evaluation of the whole child and the daily assessment of that  student. There are performance based assessments that are part of the Ready Gen program which the teachers will be using at  the end of each module to assess student performance.  We have further modified those assessments to meet the NYS  standards and the needs of our students.  Third, fourth and fifth grade students will also be completing assessments through  Schoolnet and we also administer two mock assessments in ELA and math.  Teachers use this data to inform instruction for all  students in their classroom.  Teachers use portfolios to collect and track student data.  They use this information to monitor  student progress.  The NYSITELL tells us the current level of our ENL students.  In kindergarten, we currently have 4 entering  students and 2 transitioning students.  There are no commanding/proficient students in kindergarten.  In first grade, we have 3  emerging student, 5 transitioning students, 2 expanding students and 3 commanding/proficient students.  In second grade,  there is 1 entering student, 0 emerging students, 3 transitioning student, 1 expanding students and 3 commanding/proficient  students.  In third grade, there are 3 entering students, 1 emerging student, 3 transitioning students, 7 expanding student  and 2 commanding/proficient students.  In fourth grade, there is 1 transitioning student and 2 commanding/proficient  students.  In fifth grade, there is 1 entering student, 0 emerging or transitioning students, 3 expanding student and 1  commanding/proficient student.   The RLAT data from ATS helps us to see the areas our students need to work on to reach  commanding/proficient on the NYSESLAT.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our inquiry and AIS meetings take place on Tuesday afternoons during the extended day.  Decisions and changes made during  those meetings are disseminated to the staff.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Our program, to comply with CR Part 154.2, requires that we are both an integrated and stand alone program with  most of the ENL students in the same class on a grade level.  We are able to meet the time requirement in this  way.  We are currently working with one full time ENL teacher and one two day itinerant teacher to be able to fulfill  the time requirements for our students.  It is not possible for all of the students to be in the same class because some  of our ENL students are in self contained special education classes or on the special education side of an Integrated  Co-Teaching class.  Students are grouped based on grade level.  The groups are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency  levels) because they are based on grade level.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We do not have a TBE progam at PS 18.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We do not have a DL program at PS 18.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   A schedule has been generated to ensure that all students receive the number of instructional minutes mandated by their  proficiency level.  Students have been programmed, were possible, in the same class so that Ms. Nicchio can work with them  together.  We use data points from STARS and the RLER report from ATS to program the students.  Ms. Nicchio also works a six  period day to ensure that all of the students are serviced.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our entire program is English as a New Language.  Ms. Nicchio focuses on developing vocabulary for the students in the  content areas.  She also conferences with each child and helps facilitate their writing in the classroom.  The content areas are  delivered by the ENL teacher, the content area specialist (science) and the classroom teacher.  We use the Ready Gen program  for literacy instruction, Go Math for math instruction, the FOSS science kits for science instruction and the Passport to Social  Studies program for social studies instruction.  The math, science and social studies materials are all available in Spanish for  our Spanish speaking students.  Teachers are trained in Universal Design for Learning.  As a result, pedagogical practices are  put into place to support the ENL students.  An example would be the use of images on the smart board to represent domain  specific vocabulary.  The use of "realia" (actual objects) in the classroom setting.  The use of listening centers and on-line  resources to support content learning.  All pedagogy are well versed, through professional development, to thread the ELA  instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards in ELA, to foster language development and meet the demands of  CCLS.  It is common practice in our school to hear content teachers using the language of the ELA standards, including  Foundational and Language Standards.  The ENL teacher also focuses on increasing student's vocabulary by reading in the  content areas.  All instruction has been aligned to CCLS by implementing Ready Gen in the classrooms which is a CCLS based  program.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Our entire program is English as a New Language.  We do not offer a bilingual or dual language program.   Therefore, our  students have access to materials in Spanish but we do not evaluate their progress in this language.   We have materials  available in social studies, science and math in Spanish for the teachers to use as a support.  Ms. Nicchio supports the teachers  with translations when needed.   We also have materials available to test students in their native language throughout the  school year.  We have translated testing materials and made them available to classroom teachers.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We currently do not have any SIFE students at PS 18.  If we had any SIFE students, we would find the level of the student and  support the student to develop a foundation from that level.  Classroom teachers differentiate instruction based on the needs  of the individual student.   During literacy and math instruction students participate in tiered activities focusing on improving  specific skills.  Students who are classified as entering or emerging receive 360 minutes of instruction a week.  Transitioning  and expanding students receive 180 minutes of instruction.  Proficient or commanding students receive 90 minutes of  instruction.  Students who have passed the NYSESLAT also receive service for two consecutive years under the classification of  commanding for 90 minutes a week for two years.  Ms. Nicchio, in collaboration with the classroom teacher, analyzes the  modality report from the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL to determine the areas of weakness for each student.  An area of focus for  newcomers and well as former students is determined.  Our newcomers have the most intense immersion in the English  language.  We provide those students with a buddy and support them as they develop language and can effectively  communicate with members of our school community.  Newcomers also need more individualized instruction.  We support  the classroom teacher not only through our ENL instruction but also with AIS instruction.  Developing students received  differentiated instruction through guided reading and strategy lessons within their classroom.  We are also expanding the  Orton Gillingham program in our school in the lower grades to develop the reading skills of our developing students.  The long  term ENL students who we are servicing for 4 to 6 years and longer are in the upper grades and are predominately in our self  contained special education classes.  These students benefit from the instruction which is provided in a small class setting to  meet the needs of their learning disabilities.    All students who are in our program receive the testing accommodations of  extended time and a separate location.  Students who also have an IEP can receive other accommodations if they are indicated  on their IEPs.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ENL-SWD population receives all services mandated including the ENL mandate.  We have developed our program to  ensure that each student receive not only what their IEP mandates but what their ENL mandate requires.  Across each grade,  each classroom uses the same material for literacy, math, social studies and science.  We use Ready Gen for Literacy  Instruction, GoMath for math instruction, FOSS science kits for science instruction and Passport to Social Studies program for  social studies instruction.  We do not have any students whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction.  Many of our ENL students  who have IEPs are in integrated co-teaching classes. They spend their days learning with their non-disabled peers.  Students  who are in self-contained classes are mainstreamed as much as possible with their non-disabled peers.   We try to program the  students with the most flexibility to have them with their non-disabled peers as much as possible.  Our classroom teachers are  also focusing on increasing student proficiency through direct literacy instruction and focusing on student’s using reading  strategies to improve their understanding.  They are focusing on increasing student vocabulary through content area  instruction creating an environment that is print rich to expand our ENL student’s vocabularies.  In our ENL program we will  continue to implement a balanced literacy program following the workshop model.  All teachers work with and use reading  strategies that are based on the Balanced Literacy Initiative addressing scientifically based research in the six dimensions on  reading: 1) understanding how phenomes (speech sounds) are connected to print-phonemic awareness; 2) being able to  decode unfamiliar words; 3) being able to read fluently; 4) attaining background knowledge and vocabulary to foster reading  comprehension; 5) developing appropriate active strategies to construct meaning from print-comprehension; and 6)  developing and maintaining motivation to read.  In addition, learning from looking at, and listening to, student work on a  routine basis; the integration of literacy into the content area in social studies, science, the arts and technology into the  instructional program and continued implementation of the workshop model.  We continue to add a large amount of material  to the program.  We have integrated the seven habits of effective readers into our literacy block.  They are questioning,  determining importance, activating prior knowledge (making connections), inferencing, synthesizing, visualizing and  monitoring and repairing comprehension.  We have enriched our curriculum by incorporating the Ready Gen Literacy program,  Passport to Social Studies and Foss science kits into daily instruction.  We also added new laptops to each classroom this year  to support instruction.  Our ENL teacher uses her level classroom library and our teacher’s resource room to provide the  students with a literature rich environment which crosses the content areas.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Students are scheduled to maximize their instructional time.  The ENL provider pushes in to support the students during  literacy instruction in small groups.  At other times, the ENL teacher pulls out the identified student and parallels classroom  instruction with an emphasis on building vocabulary.  Students are evaluated by the school assessment team to determine if  there are significant academic delays that interfere with their acquisition of grade standard skills.  If a student is approximately  one year below grade level they would be considered for our Integrated Co-Teaching program.  We are always looking for  placement which would best meet an individual student's academic needs.  Students are always placed in the least restrictive  environment whether that be ICT or a self contained class.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our data indicates a number of implications for instruction.  We have designated a block of time each day to focus on small  group instruction.  Our program is English as a New Language, because of this, our intervention programs focus on the  student's work in English and not their native language.  Intervention services are offered in English.  During literacy  instruction, the students complete tiered activities where they apply the skill introduced during the mini lesson.  These  activities provide scaffolded instruction to meet the specific needs for our ENL learners.  Tiered activities are also part of our  math program.  Students also have the opportunity to be part of our AIS program which is provided by our speech and AIS  teachers.  They teachers focus on language development using the Orton Gillingham and Mondo programs. Teachers address  social studies and science needs through small group instruction and tiered activities that are part of our literacy program.  We  must continue to focus on our entering and emerging students and provide them with the skills they need to become  proficient in all four areas.   We are specifically targeting our entering, emerging and transitioning students to help them  develop the skills needed to improve their reading level.   Classroom teachers also focus on improving individual students skills  when they meet with their guided reading groups and conference with individual students.  Classroom teachers look at  student progress with relation to the Teacher's College Running Records.  The goal is for each student to be reading on grade  level by the end of the school year.  In the 2016-2017 school year, we saw a slight decrease in our ENL population.  At this  time, we do not have data to determine the number of kindergarten ENL students.  Many Spanish speaking students who  attend our full day PreK program before kindergarten passed the NYSITELL and were not eligible for ENL services.  Students  who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT are supported through extra pull out AIS instruction.  All students, current and  former, are invited to attend our ENL after school program.  This after school program meets two days a week after school.  It  is another opportunity for the students to improve their language skills.  The library is an important part of the  program.  Students work with the librarian on literacy based activities to improve student vocabulary and literacy  skills.  Current ENL students also receive ENL test accommodations of time extension, separate location, access to a bilingual  dictionary, simultaneous use of English and the alternate language for all exams except the ELA exam, oral translation where  home language is not available and written response in the home language for all exams except the ELA exam.   These  accommodations are also available for students for two years after they pass the NYSESLAT.   We will continue to focus on our  entering and emerging students by either pushing in or pulling them out during morning literacy instruction for intensive  instruction intended to support the ENL student in achieving a level of English proficiency which will allow them to function  productively in their classrooms.  We also use a buddy system within the classrooms where ENL students work closely with  their English Proficient counterparts to increase their language development.  The targeted intervention for ELA, math, social  studies and science is provided though our AIS/RTI program in grades K - 5.  Literacy instruction focuses on non-fiction text to  address social studies and science instruction.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are focusing on addressing the standards through the current program.  We have worked this Spring on our curriculum  maps to create a program which is integrated to meet the needs of all of our students.  We are focusing on improving  instruction through planning and improving instruction.  We will also be implementing Impact teams across the school to look  at student work and improve instruction.  Each grade prioritized the standards, choosing the focus for each a unit of  study.  Standards that align to the focused standards were also included in the curriculum maps.  After lessons have been  implemented we reflect and decide if we need to refine or adjust the lesson.   We have trained eight additional lower grade  classroom teachers this summer in the Orton Gillingham approach.  This is in addition to the AIS and speech teachers who  received training last year.  We have expanded this program because we the data indicated students who participated in the  program improved their reading level.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We never had a bilingual program at PS 18.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We have an ENL after school program to support our current and former ENL students.  It is held two days a week. There are  groups of 12-15 students on each grade participating.  Every student receives an invitation to attend the program.  Ms. Nicchio  also contacts parents of students who have not registered to encourage them to allow their children to participate.  Mr.  Rodriguez sends out information through school messenger to ensure that parents are aware of the program.  We will be using  the Afterschool Achievers Reading Club program from Great Source.  We also plan to continue with our Saturday  Academy.  This will begin in January.  We feel both of these programs will increase the opportunities for our ENL students to  become proficient more quickly.  This program is available to all 3  rd  , 4  th   and 5  th   grade students who would like to  attend.  They are afforded equal access to this program.  Native language materials are provided through our ENL teacher,  Mrs. Nicchio.  P.S. 18 is also a Beacon school.  All students who are part of the P.S. 18 school community are eligible to  participate in the after school and Saturday activities provided by United Activities Unlimited.  All ENL students are afforded  equal access to all programs in the school.  Our ENL after school program is funded through Title III money.  Our Saturday  Academy is funded through fair student funding money in galaxy.  United Activities Unlimited is funded through outside  sources and not from the school budget.  All of our programs are traditionally at capacity with participating by many of our ENL  students.  Ms. Nicchio is always available to our parents to discuss the different programs which are available to our ENL  students and to encourage their participation.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We are using the Ready Gen Literacy Program, the Go Math program, the Foss kits for Science instruction and Passport to  Social Studies series.  The Ready Gen and Go Math programs have a technology component which is used in all  classrooms.  Students in the all grades have access to the computer based programs Starfall, Moby Max, Pebblego, Reading  Eggs, Brainpop and ABC Mouse which helps the students develop English proficiency.  All of our programs are in predominately  in English to develop those language skills for the students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   There are a number of staff members who speak Spanish and are available to support our ENL students as they develop their  understanding and knowledge of the English language.   We have Spanish materials available in math, social studies and  science for students to support them during this instruction.  Students will have access to books in English and Spanish to help  them develop their English skills.  We use students and parents to help us translate for language support for languages other  than English and Spanish.  All workshops which are provided throughout the school year for parents are supported by Ms.  Nicchio.  She works closely with Ms. DeSantis, our UFT Teacher's Center coach, to translate relevant material to support our  parents.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our staff evaluates the developmental ability of the student when planning for differentiated instruction for the  student.  During collaborative inquiry, the teachers look at student work and focus on trends that need to be addressed.  Our  classroom teachers understand how to support the students in their class to be successful with material on their current age  and grade level.  Our ENL teacher is also helping the students develop background knowledge and vocabulary that support the  themes and topics students will encounter during the school year.    Ms. Nicchio works closely with our ENL-SWD teachers to  help them meet the needs of the students in their classroom.   Our teachers use the Ready Gen reading program, Go Math  program, the Department of Education Unit of Study Social Studies program and the Foss science kits.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are using the Ready Gen Literacy Program, the Go Math program, the Foss kits for Science instruction and Passport to  Social Studies series.  The Ready Gen and Go Math programs have a technology component which is used in all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         classrooms.  Students in the all grades have access to the computer based programs Starfall, Moby Max, Pebblego, Reading  Eggs, Brainpop and ABC Mouse which helps the students develop English proficiency.  All of our programs are in predominately  in English to develop those language skills for the students.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Parents who register students prior to the beginning of school receive information on how they can support their students  during the school year.   We do not currently have activities planned prior to student enrollment to acclimate those students  to their new school environment.  Students who enroll during the school year are invited to participate in our after school  program.   Mr. Marbury, school guidance counselor supports the ENL parents as they transition to middle school.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to our ENL students.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program at PS 18.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Staff members, both teachers and paraprofessionals, participate in professional development opportunities which are offered  by the Department of Education, our Borough Field Support Office and our field liaison from the UFT teacher's center.  Our ENL  teacher, Ms. Nicchio, attends many of these workshops.  She is responsible for turnkeying the information and content to all  school staff during Monday Afternoon professional development time.  Two teachers attended QTEL training over the  summer.  They are also responsible for turnkeying this training during Monday Afternoon professional development  sessions.  This is documented as part of the ENL Compliance Binder.  It is also documented as part of Mr. Rodriguez's  professional development plan for the entire school.  The goal of our professional development is to improve student  performance by improving the ability of all teachers to design and implement a comprehensive and effective instructional  program for all ENLs.  The parent coordinator and secretaries have also been trained, through the borough field support office  in the intake process for ENL students.  We are focusing this year on breaking down the standards and making sure we are  addressing the standards on each grade level so we can prepare the students as they move to the next grade.  This training will  be led by our coach, Mrs. Donna DeSantis.  We also provide our teachers with ongoing training to implement the new Ready  Gen literacy program and Go Math program.  Staff development for all teachers will be in the four modalities (listening,  reading, writing and speaking) including combination modalities for level adjustments - these designations can assist teachers  in differentiating instruction for their students.  We continue to focus on implementing a structured prototype during balanced  literacy.  The implementation of this initiative is supported through grade level meetings.  The ENL teacher will also present  staff development which presents opportunities to learn strategies that support and scaffold listening, speaking, reading and  writing as well as content knowledge. Our goal is to support the teachers as they work with the ENL students in their  classroom.  We also schedule our ENL teacher to plan with the classroom teacher in an effort to support the ENL  students.  Pedagogues who require training have an opportunity to participate in workshops offered through the UFT Teacher  Center.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional development requirements are met during our Monday Afternoon PLC sessions.  Two Monday afternoons each  month are dedicated to professional learning geared to improving our work with ENL students.  Some of the topics which are  offered are multiple entry points to support our ENL learners and turnkeying the QTEL training which staff members attended  this summer.  Professional learning sessions were also provided by our liaison from the UFT teacher's center, Rosemarie  LoMonaco, during full day professional learning sessions titled: Strategies to address the needs of the ENL learner in your  class.  Mr. Rodriguez keeps records of the activities through agenda and attendance in a compliance binder in his office.   The  professional development provided exceeds the requirements as per CR Part 154.2.       Parental Involvement      1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our parent coordinator has established a communication system to meet the needs of our parents.    All teachers are available  to parents during parent engagement time on Tuesday afternoons.  Teachers are also available during parent teachers  conferences which are held three times a year.  These meeting help us to set goals for our students with the parents to assess  language development progress and language proficiency progress.  We provide translation services where necessary to  facilitate meetings with teachers.  Ms. Nicchio also provides workshops for our parents in conjunction with our ENL after  school program.  Her focus has always been to explain the importance of language development for students to be successful  across all of the content areas in school.  She provides workshops on topics such as preparing your child for the NYS ELA or  Math exams and why it is important for your student to read every night.  All correspondences from the main office are  distributed in English and Spanish. Translation services are available for the teachers, through other staff members, for parent  teacher conferences where language is an issue.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Mr. Schembri, our parent coordinator conducts meetings and workshops to inform parents about ways they can support their  student’s learning.  Ms. Nicchio also conducts workshops as part of our afterschool program.  Mrs. DeSantis conducts  workshops as part of the Saturday Academy.  We have done workshops on the following topics:  1) Understanding your child's IEP  2) Understanding the NYS ELA and Math exam  3) Daily living skills  4) Understanding the NYSESLAT  5) Literacy - how to help improve your student's reading and writng skills  6) Developing conversation skills in your daily life - talking to your child at home as a way to improve their vocabulary.  7) Getting to know the Common Core State Standards  8) Asthma  9) Mental Health  10) Nutrition  11) How to deal with Stress  12) Literacy with students and parents  We also translate all documents for the parents so they can understand what is going on in our school.  When parents come in  to school with questions about documents, we have staff members available who can speak to parents in Spanish and explain  documents, procedures or help parents fill out documents correctly.  We also have an open door policy to address parent  needs.  Our principal, Mr. Robert Rodriguez, conducted a meeting at the beginning of the school year to provide the parents  the opportunity to discuss their concerns about the school.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robert Rodriguez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 18 John G Whittier                                                                              School DBN: 31R018  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
