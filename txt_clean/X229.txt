The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      Mission Statement    Our mission is to create a challenging learning environment that encourages students to express and achieve their  greatest potential. We deliver a diverse and integrated curriculum that reaches across all disciplines at all grade  levels. Students are encouraged to meet academic challenges with openness, critical thinking and creative problem  solving. We promote an atmosphere of cooperation and a can-do spirit, with respect for individual differences and  community values. We strive to have our parents, teachers, and community members actively involved in making  student learning as rich and fulfilling as it can be.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Dr. Roland N. Patterson School, Intermediate School 229 is located along the Harlem River in the Morris Heights  section of the Bronx. The school is adjacent to Roberto Clemente State Park and River Park Towers Apartments which  provides housing for 1, 654 families in four 44-story buildings and is home to the majority of the school’s students. In  the interceding years since the school opened in 1977, the population of the River Park Towers and, consequently IS  229 has shifted dramatically. Demographically, the complex now mirrors the surrounding community in terms of  poverty levels and associated social issues. Many of the families fall below federal poverty guidelines and significant  numbers are recent immigrants.   The student body is serviced by 53 professionals, including teachers, guidance counselors, social workers and  administrators. All of the teachers are certified.    The open classroom design that was viewed as an asset in the past, has become one of the school’s greatest  impediments to the delivery of instruction. As a result of the lack of defined instructional areas, disruptions within one  group could ripple throughout the rest of the open classrooms, resulting in a climate that is not conducive to  meaningful instruction. The level of noise created by the side-by-side open classroom environment, transitions  between classes, and two separate lunch period occurring at different locations continues to be problematic. At  times, this leads to an overall deterioration in the tone of the school. Intermediate School 229 shares the building  with PS 274, a pre-K to fifth grade school. PS 274 has the first floor, 2nd floor and half of the third floor. We share the  gym space and auditorium as well as entrance/exit. The remainder of the building is used by IS 229. Each school has  its own administration, schedules, and needs. As would be expected, the priorities of each school are not always  mutual.    The continued use of a Dean by IS 229 to manage student deportment and intervention has led to the creation of a  management control system for tracking school climate data in a laser like manner. School climate data summarized  in the DOE's Online Occurrence System Report System indicated, greater supervision is required in hot spots such as  hallways and classrooms and the need for staff to possess crisis Intervention strategies that will support teachers in  de-escalating students in crisis.      Classes 601, 701 and 801 participate in a unique partnership with the American Composers’ Orchestra. These classes  have a high population of English Language Learners and former ELLs. The “Percussion Ensemble” is a unique program       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      that incorporates drumming, rhythmic composition and notation, chorus, song writing and sight reading. IS 229 has a  thriving drama program, and is the only middle school in the Bronx that is a member of the Thespian Society.   In addition to the traditional benefits of music education, our ELLs benefit from having English reinforcement through  a variety of modalities. The students are utilizing both production and receptive skills. The rhythmic notation also  reinforces Math skills in a context beyond the Math class. Other partners include National Teaching Network (NTN)  and Middle School Teaching Initiative that are helping our school raise instructional quality by providing opportunities  for students to demonstrate their critical reasoning skills across curricula. Wingspan Arts is also partnering with IS 229  to engage all sixth-grade classes in a multidisciplinary Arts Program on site with a teaching artist. Students will learn  modern, hip hop, and Latin dancing to support physical fitness. The EngradePro electronic program is used school- wide to effectively monitor student progress, track student data, and increase parent communication through e-mails,  class newsletters and websites.    This year data indicates a rise in families “doubling up” which has increased our temporary housing population.  Presently 25 percent of our families reside in temporary housing.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   IS 229 is now faced with meeting the needs of a student population that is predominantly poor and academically at- risk. As of June 24, 2018, the school serves 242 students in the sixth through eighth grades. According to the latest  available information, 65% of the students are of Hispanic and 34.0% are African-American descent. Our percentage  of students with IEPs is over the city’s average. Approximately 38% of the students (98) have Individual Educational  Plans (IEPs) and receive the full continuum of services including self-contained instruction; and other related services  such as Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) within the context of their general education programs.  Additionally, 20% of the students (52) originally speak over ten distinct languages and are English Language Learners  (ELLs). Of the ELLs, the vast majority (85%) are Spanish dominant. Officially, 100% of the students are eligible for free  lunch. Many of the newly enrolled students are at Level 1 or 2 on standardized City and State Assessments in both  English Language Arts and Mathematics. This year we were also chosen as a school to run a Horizon Program for  applicable students in grades 6-8.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide demonstrates that we have exceeded the majority of the targets in the  Framework Elements of Supportive Environment and Trust. Data on the framework elements also revealed that the  school is approaching target in the remaining four of six elements including rigorous instruction. In addition, the  school is designated “Titled 1 Focus" for 2018-19. The school also experienced ELA gains from 12 percent in 2017 to  17.5 percent in 2018. The key areas of focus during the 2018-19 school year are opening the minds of students to  become critical thinkers in key subjects and in everyday issues impacting their lives; raising student attendance by 5  percent or from 89.8 to 95 percent; elevating teacher pedagogy in areas such as Danielson Framework for Teaching  components 1e, 3b, 3c, 3d; fostering collaboration among teachers and raising student performance in math  especially mastery of expressions and equations, proportional relationships, modeling and the number system.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X229   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   246   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

ELA data from the 2017-18 New York State assessments is unavailable at this time. However, macro data from the met  not met showed that 58 students that performed at level 1 in 2016-17 are no longer level 1. And 22 that were level 3  met promotional criteria. These data among others translate into a 11 percent growth in student performance or the  needle moved from 14 percent to almost 18 percent on the 2017-18 NYS ELA assessment. Following is a descriptive  presentation of student ELA perormance 2016-2018:   Table 1   Student 2017-18 NYS ELA and Math Results, Level 3-4 by content area   Content Area   Performance Level      Math  ELA  Total   Level 4   3  5  8   Level 3   8  22  30       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15         Table 1 shows the following:     11 students met the state standards in Math. And of the 11, 3 are exceeded the state standards.    27 students met the state standards in ELA. And of the 27, 5 exceeded the state standards.   Action steps 1     We need to move an additional 40 math students from level 2 to three to reach the 20 percent mark on the   number students performing at level three on the 2019 NYS math test. We also need an additional 38 ELA  students performing at level 2 to add to the 27 to arrive at 25 percent mark on the number students performing  at level three on the 2019 NYS ELA test.      These students will be enrolled in a specialized Saturday academy for additional intensive work.    Rational for likely success- over 70 percent of 2018 level 2 Math students and 60 percent of 2018 level 2 ELA   students performed at level 2 or better during the last three administration of NYS tests.    Table 2   Student 2017-18 NYS ELA and Math results, Level 1-2 by content area   Performance Level   Level 2   35  56   Level 1   168  132      Content Area   Math  ELA      Table shows the following:     203 students did not meet standards. And 35 of the 203 met or partially met some of the standards.    188 did not meet the state standards. And of the 188, 56 partially met some the standards.    Action steps 2     37 percent of 2018 level 1 ELA students and 38 percent of 2018 level 1 ELA students performed at level 2 or   better at least once during the last three administration of NYS tests. Compared to these students, the ones that  received level I in each of the last three administrations of the NYS math and ELA test ill received more intensive  interventions that target the students’ skill deficit.   If they do not achieve the desired level of progress every 6-8 Weeks, recommendations will be made for a  comprehensive evaluation trying at utmost to avoid recommending eligibility for special educations services.      Math data from the 2017-18 New York State assessments showed no significant change in student performance in  math. The performance of students remained constant at 7 percent.   Compared to ELA overall performance, math does not fare well. The trend for level 1s and level 3s & 4s is moving  upward and in the wrong direction. Level 2s on the other hand trend downward and in the right direction.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16      The underlying weakness in our math instructional programs that led to the perverse performance results summarized  above were observed during the 2016-18 school years. For example, it was noted that, “Across grades students struggle  with tasks in expressions and equations and geometry in grade 6; the number system and ratios and proportional  relationships in grade 7; statistics and probability, expressions and equations, and functions in grade 8.    The following initiatives will be adopted for the school to decrease the overall levels 1 and 2, while increasing the  percent of students at level 3 and 4.     Writing/Reading skills block (Grade 7 & 8 2xweek);    Professional development – all staff will experience differentiated critical thinking PD learning cycle provided by   Consultant Support in math (NTN) and ELA (MSQI), QTEL, Common planning, Election Day PD offered by the  BFSC, Showcase schools and school. Teachers are placed in a Cohort and each learning cycle will consist of 3-5  series or monthly sessions;     Professional Learning block 1xweek built into each teacher schedule for collaborative planning and looking   student work;     Progress monitoring – Reading skills and ELA Skills assessment and classroom assessment such as Student work  and teacher feedback; research block created for librarian to show students how to conduct research and how  to use research data to write persuasive pieces.      Other assessments are used to provide reliability measures (1.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need  student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   During Implementation teachers will include performance-based  tasks in core content areas; close reading of texts, attention to  academic vocabulary, convention and organization.   Within the classrooms teachers will pose open ended scaffold  questions that build on and use students’ responses to questions,  and challenge students to justify their reasoning as well as the  reasoning of others.   All students, even those who do not volunteer, will have sufficient  time to think and rationalize their thinking to responses. Teachers  will step out of the central mediating role and allow the learner to  control the discussions.   parents engagement will include the following activities: to support  parents' understanding of, and participation instructional initiatives;  parent literacy development as needed ( with SEBNC, our partner,  we will be providing basic education, GED, ESL, and computer  classes); support from increased parent participation on the school  leadership team; and increase familiarity with programs in literacy  (Expeditionary Learning grades 6-8.)

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     School representatives such as school mentors, supervisors, coaches, and support staff,    Principal, Assistant Principals and Teachers responded to a self-evaluation survey based multiple constructs from the  quality review and other accountability measures. The survey results are triangulated to identify staff perception of  what the school is doing well and what the school needs to improve. The staff development committee consisting of  content area teachers and supervisors met weekly in teams to identify best practices aligned to the Quality review  Rubric and the DFfT. Results were compared with findings from the school’s most recent official SQR, marking period  grades, Measures of Student Learning (MOSL), Low Inference Observations, and the 2018 PPO to isolate patterns of  underlying strengths and weaknesses in our academic programs. For example, Math lessons were modified to assist  students unable to compute fractions, decimals and whole numbers.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. I.S. 229, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       I.S. 229 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Data also showed  that the areas of need were in the reading and writing modalities.  An after-school program will  enable these ELL students to attain the commanding proficiency level on the NYSESLAT by  targeting reading comprehension, writing skills and vocabulary using English as New Language  (ENL) methodology.    The targeted requisite reading and writing skills using ENL methodology will also supplement  literacy instruction which will enable the ELL students to make gains on the State ELA and Math  assessments.  Additional instructional support will be provided through i-Ready and myON that  are intervention programs already being implemented in the school.  The ENL teacher will work  closely with the targeted ELL students providing them with scaffolded and differentiated  instruction to meet their needs.    The after-school ENL program will address 23 ELL students at the expanding proficiency in  grades 6 to 8, on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. for a total of 4 hours a  week.  The program will be for a period of 23 weeks.  Instruction will be provided by one (1)  ENL certified teacher.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students are assessed using a variety of diagnostic, formative, and summative data. In addition to the ELA exam and the  NYSESLAT exam, students' literacy skills are assessed using running records. Additional data is collected from the BOY  assessment in reading and writing assessments aligned with the CCLS. Ongoing data is collected in order to ensure that  students are making progress. This data is collected from tasks in all content areas, BOY reading and writing assessments,  additional administrations of running records, reading conferences, and teacher made assessments. All data is used to  differentiate unit and lesson plans, create targeted intervention groups, and identify areas of study for our professional       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59      learning communities. The are three benchmark assessments administered throughout the year in ELA and Math, in addition  to I-Ready in ELA and Math. The patterns across proficiency levels and grades show a clear deficiency in writing and reading.  Students also perform weakest in the areas of gathering meaning from written material, vocabulary, grammar, and phonemic  awareness. The strongest modalities in this population are listening and speaking. The deficiencies in reading and writing also  hinder progress in Science, Social Studies, and Math and students must be provided with rigorous instruction that includes  research-based ELL strategies such as differentiated instruction, scaffolded work, and vocabulary instruction. Students must  also receive targeted intervention that will address the needs of specific subgroups such as long term ELLs, SIFE students, and  students with disabilities. According to running record assessments, the majority of our current SIFE and LT ELL students are  reading at a 2nd grade level or lower. Further analysis of classroom assessments proved that the SIFE and LT ELL students at all  reading levels need more intensive work in the areas of vocabulary acquisition, phonemic awareness, and reading  comprehension which will be provided through the literacy program, Sound Reading Solutions, literature circles and guided  reading groups. Additionally, Science and Social Studies teachers will engage in professional study groups focused on reading  non fiction texts, writing evidence based essays, and teaching vocabulary. Literacy teachers will engage in study groups about  close reading of rigorous texts with the end goal of improving reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. The  implications of this data for the school’s instruction are to apply all our resources to identify and minimize the academic areas  where students struggle and reinforce the areas where students show strengths, so they might demonstrate gains in all  academic areas and on all required standardized tests: the ELA, the State Math test and the NYSESLAT. Students’ specific  needs will be continuously monitored through assessments and the data will be used to modify classroom instruction and  intervention services. The assessment tools we use to assess literacy skills are the ELL Periodic Assessment, Fall and Spring,  teacher-generated common core aligned assessments and a writing baseline. The ELL Periodic results indicate that most of our  ELLs are reading two grades behind their peers. Most of our ELLs with special needs tested below 50% in each of the three  categories--reading, vocabulary, and comprehension--assessed on the ELL Periodic Assessment. Based on this data, the ESL  teacher knows what to target when providing instruction for ELL students and ELA teachers know what to target when  providing small group instruction. This information will help inform the school's instructional plan by identifying large  populations at the entering and low intermediate levels , which has resulted in assigning two certified ELA teachers to work  collaboratively with our ESL teachers. It has provided us the opportunity to modify the curriculum in order to differentiate  instruction to meet the needs of all ELLs. We have also assigned targeted pedagogues to attend professional learning cycles  focused around curriculum and teaching ELLs.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The 2017 ELA results revealed greater consistency with students' performance on the 2017 NYSESLAT. More that 90% of the  ELLs at the entering or low intermediate level are level 1s and more than 90% of the ELLs at the expanding level are Level 2s.  Currently, none of the ELLs are level 3s or 4s, and only 4% are level 3s in math. Throughout the year, we will continue to use  quantitative and qualitative data to determine the success of our ESL program. The quantitative data will include: ● the  percent of ELLs meeting or exceeding the standards on the NYS ELA, Math and Science exams ● the percent of ELLs making at  least one year of progress on the NYS ELA and Math exams ● the progress students make as per the data from the Periodic  assessments ● the percent of students who earn a Commanding on the NYSESLAT ● Report Card grades ● the percentage of  ELLs meeting AYP. Our qualitative data will include: ● students' ELA portfolio, which includes a variety of writing samples, 5 ●  teachers' evaluation of ELLs progress, ● feedback from ENL staff on the effectiveness of the ENL program, and ● feedback from  ELLs and parents on the effectiveness of the ESL program. All ELL students take the ENL Baseline assessment towards the  beginning of the year. Scores are used to identify language domains that require targeted instruction, so that ENL teachers can  differentiate instruction     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   The ELL data analysis Tool is utilized to analyze data in order monitor progress, to assess and prioritize the needs of ELLs, and  to assess progress toward meeting goals.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60         The ENL team meets weekly to analyze summative data, determine the greatest instructional areas of need, and plan for  targeted instruction. The ENL teachers then meet with core subject area teachers to discuss the results of the data and co-plan  lessons that differentiates the content in a way that engages ELL students’ interest and develops their four language domains     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ELL students receive strong core instruction (Tier I). When a student does not show sufficient progress, Tier II strategies are  implemented by the teacher usually within the classroom in the form of differentiation or in weekly labs. Student progress is  monitored and adjusted as needed by the student. If with Tier II intervention the student is still not making adequate progress,  intensive targeted intervention is provided in small group settings during school, afterschool, and on Saturdays. Progress is  continuously monitored and instruction is adjusted according to student progress. Students are identified for intervention  because ELL data is collected on an ongoing basis. ELL data is analyzed  and students are provided with different tiers of  intervention services as needed.  The school has a school wide interdisciplinary team that includes a teacher, administrator,  guidance counselor, attendance worker, and counselors who analyze student needs based on teacher referrals and  assessment data.  The school also has grade level interdisciplinary teams that meet every week to plan instruction based on  data gathered from the week's classwork and assessments.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data from the NYSESLAT, CC ELA, CC Math determines how ENL teachers structure their schedules to offer service complying  with CR Part 154. Periodic iReady assessment shows students’ math and ELA growth. ENL teachers look at this data to identify  specific areas of need so that those skill domains can be addressed during integrated or stand alone instruction.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  Findings from data analysis are shared via data drives in the beginning of the academic year. Each teacher receives an  administrative spreadsheet detailing students scores on all NYS CC and school-wide assessments. Weekly common planning  sessions are used to keep up to date with individual progress and grouping of students within a particular classroom.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL classes are given using the integrated model for total of 180 minutes per week. Students are grouped  heterogeneously and travel together in one class. The ENL provider has stand alone classes with students requiring  more than 180 minutes per week.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?            All entering and emerging ELL students receive 4 periods of integrated ENL service and 4 periods of stand alone service  per week. Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding level ELLs receive ENL instruction through integrated service only. Our  ENL teachers co-plan and co-teach with ELA teachers to differentiate lessons that meet the needs of ELLs and help them  acquire key language arts content. ELL students receive two periods of Spanish language instruction per week that can  improve home language proficiency.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    Core content is delivered in English with native language translations/supports when applicable. Students are guided to write  using Thinking Maps and visual anticipatory sets. Student led discussion in small group format is frequent. A large portion of  content is introduced through exploration in the station format.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students are given the Spanish LAB-R upon entry to the school following guidelines after Home Language Survey information.  Throughout the year, teachers use home language supports to ensure that students can engage with content. "Word  Glossaries" are provided to content area teachers to support ELLs with Tier 2 and 3 vocabulary words.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A) SIFE students are identified based on four part criteria: entering the United States after second grade, interrupted formal  schooling, low reading and math scores, and pre-literacy skills in the students’ home language. Once students are identified as  SIFE, they receive individualized instruction in foundational literacy skills to help them catch up with their peers. SIFE students  8 are given many more visual cues. The classroom procedures for working on activities are projected onto the SmartBoard  often with matching images for the class norms and product expected after small group work. They follow a specific classroom  protocol where the only variable is the content. Many teachers have taken this approach due to the need for consistency and  normalcy for children whose academic experiences have been inconsistent. Much of the differentiation comes from using  native language buddy systems, visual representation of concepts (Thinking Maps), use of predictable signal phrases and cloze  writing strategies for pertinent vocabulary. B) Spanish speaking newcomers take the LAB-R exam to assess their native  language proficiency. Entering and emerging ELLs receive four periods of integrated services and four periods of stand alone  instruction per week. During integrated ENL, students are grouped with bilingual and native speakers to facilitate collaboration  and enriching discussion. During stand-alone ENL, entering and emerging students recieve content and language instruction  with native language support and scaffolds to help them reach a higher proficiency level. Newcomer allowing students to  receive information in the form of visuals, native language and multiple entry points for comprehension of complex content,  students are pre-taught much of the vocabulary required. The Language Experience Approach is used to have a shared text  and improve general writing, keeping a shared class version of edits, revisions, and brainstormed topics. C. Developing ELLs are  given less teacher led peer interaction, and more focused modeled material which allows for independence in production of  written pieces that are more representative of student's own thinking. However, the vocabulary used in instruction is often  pre-identified for the concepts at hand. Some Thinking Maps may be pre populated with certain information, but not all. This  allows for student to develop language used in discussion curriculum/relevant topics. D) Long term ELLs tend to have have  advanced oral language skills, but underdeveloped skill in their reading and writing domains. Given this, ENL teachers  differentiate their learning targets to address these areas of need and help students score well on the NYSESLAT exam. Many  long term ELLs may also be students with disabilities, so appropriate scaffolds and UDL principles are implemented to allow       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      students to engage with rigorous content. E) Former ELLs receive at least 90 minutes of integrated instruction in content area  classes. ENL teachers differentiate to ensure that former ELLs understand the content that their subject area teacher delivers,  ensuring that former ELLs can function independently and achieve in their classes in subsequent grade levels and beyond.  Providing the same information through a variety of ways, providing alternative media for expression, allowing students to  compose in multiple media such as text, speech, drawing, illustration, comics, storyboards, design, film, music, visual art,  sculpture, or video are all methods of getting students to engage with the concepts specific to the curriculum. Giving more  than one channel to show their language acquisition helps students surpass the limits placed on standardized assessments as  sole evidence regarding acquisition of language and conceptual skills. The data provided by benchmark assessments, iReady,  AND MYON, show the reading level of individual students. With this data, teachers choose appropriate texts to integrate into  their curriculum, and adjust student working groups to facilitate better cooperation amongst peers.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment as per each child's specific needs. A child's services are tailored to  address his/her specific strengths and areas of need. For example, a child may receive push in or pull out services as per  his/her specific needs. A child may be provided with a self-contained setting for part of the school day and a mainstream  setting for another subject. These decisions are made collaboratively with the teachers, parent, district representative, school  psychologist, and related service providers. Teachers meet on a weekly basis to discuss students’ needs and progress and any  programmatic changes that might be needed to address students’ needs. If students struggle in their current program/setting,  a team of the student’s teachers discuss and implement intervention strategies before the IEP referral process begins.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELLs are have been programmed to have Reading Skills and Math Skills as additional academic intervention in English and  Math core areas, respectively. They receive these programs in English, however Math Skils program is supported by native  language scaffolds and translations where applicable. ENL teachers push into Math and ELA classes and support the acquisition  of content by teaching language objectives that help ELLs comprehend.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Last year, we began using an online reading and writing program called “ThinkCerca” with our ELL classes. This program is  meant to develop and assess ELLs ability to read and analyze a text, then write an argumentative essay. Over the summer,  several members of the ENL department attended professional development workshops to learn how to better integrate  ThinkCerca into the curriculum. Some improvements we would like to make in implementing ThinkCerca involve creating  collaborative student working groups, selecting grade appropriate texts that complement existing curriculum materials, and  using I-READY as a form of authentic assessment.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Students who utilized MYON last year earned better scores on their ELA exams, as such, we have expanded our the number of  classes utilizing the program. This year, the ENL department has committed to more common planning hours, and a shared  curriculum has been developed so that students of different grade levels and proficiency levels can engage with common  themes and essential questions.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The Transitional Bilingual Education program was phased out after parent selection forms enumerated we no longer had  sufficient amount of parents preferring bilingual instruction to keep the class/bridge class open.nt          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are provided with intervention programs after school that target the needs of specific groups such as Math and ELA test  taking skills and Science tutoring. The After School and supplemental services offered to students are as follows: after school  math intervention program is provided twice a week, literacy labs are provided twice a week, the After School Book Club is  held twice a week, and Saturday Academy occurs once a week. ELLs are encouraged to join extracurricular clubs such as the  the Drama Club, and the Percussion Class which is run by the ELL staff. Students are also invited to attend programs through  our community based organization, South East Bronx Neighborhood Center. Saturday metro cards are provided to students to  ensure students can travel to and from programs. Parent outreach is done by the parent coordinator and teachers to ensure  that families are aware of intervention opportunities. Outreach is done over the phone, electronically via Engrade, and through  back-packed flyers. All outreach is done in both English and Spanish. If a parent speaks a language other than Spanish,  translators are used to make phone calls in the home language.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Computers were procured through Donors Choose. These computers are used to help with Think Cerca, the writing program  for ELLs. MyOn is an online reading program utilized by ELLs that has books in English and Spanish. I-Ready is used as a means  10 of skills development in ELA. Google Slides is a program used for presentations. Independent reading books are an essential  component of the program for ELLs. Students are assessed throughout the year. As they advance in reading levels, they will  need additional independent reading books. Students’ levels range from level D to Z and each student needs a large volume of  texts on his/her level in order to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to advance to the next reading level. A greater  number and variety of non-fiction texts for all subject areas are needed as students work towards meeting the common core  standards. Technology based applications such as Sound Reading Solutions, Rosetta Stone and Khan Academy are also an  essential component of the instructional program. Ipad applications enhance student learning by providing hands on visuals,  individualized interventions, and scaffolded supports such as translated dictionaries. Other intervention materials such as  RIGOR, Rewards, English 3D, and Go Math support student learning. Students in the ENL program receive support through  vocabulary instruction, translated texts, and translated exams as needed. Some students use handheld translators/dictionaries  or other technology devices to connect their separate linguistic competencies. Independent reading is emphasized in ELA  classes, and ELLS have access to native language texts in the school library and MYON, which also assesses student’s  comprehension.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students in the ENL program receive native language support through vocabulary instruction, translated texts, and translated  exams as needed. Some students use handheld translators/dictionaries or other technology devices to connect their separate  linguistic competencies. Independent reading is emphasized in ELA classes, and ELLS have access to native language texts in  the school library and MYON, which also assesses student’s comprehension. All intervention programs are aligned to the CCLS  grade level standards. When ELL students read below grade level the school purchases texts appropriate for the students' ages  and instructional levels with the end goal of the students reading at or above grade level. Some Emerging ELLs utilize  headphones so they can hear the text read to them, since their listening skills are more advanced than the decoding.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Independent reading books are an essential component of the program for ELLs. Students are assessed throughout the year  and as they advance in reading levels they need additional independent reading books. Students’ levels range from level D to Z  and each student needs a large volume of texts on his/her level in order to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to advance  to the next reading level. A greater number and variety of non-fiction texts for all subject areas are needed as students work  towards meeting the common core standards. Technology based applications such as Sound Reading Solutions, Rosetta Stone  and Khan Academy are also an essential component of the instructional program. Ipad applications enhance student learning  by providing hands on visuals, individualized interventions, and scaffolded supports such as translated dictionaries. Other  intervention materials such as RIGOR, Rewards, English 3D, and Do the Math support student learning. IS 229 is a co-located       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         building. A student teacher at the co-located school is working towards an ENL certification. She assisted with the ENL teacher  at IS 229.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    IS 229 is a co-located building. A student teacher at the co-located school is working towards an ENL certification. In the 2016- 2017 school year, she satisfied her student teaching hours by assisting the ENL teacher at IS 229. This year, both schools share  a library and librarian so that all ELLs have access to literature and technology     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   New students are invited to an open house at the beginning of the school year where they are able to learn about the school's  instructional program, academic opportunities, and extracurricular programs. When students are enrolled later in the year the  11 parent coordinator meets with families and provides them with information about the school. Additionally teachers reach  out to new families to welcome them to the school. In order for parents to understand all three program choices, they are  invited to meet with the ELL Staff within a week of their children’s admission to learn about the school programs and facilities  it offers its students. This process is ongoing throughout the year. new ELLS are paired with a Native Language buddy to help  them acclimate to the school. The ENL teachers, Samuel Redwood and Lucy Osakwe, meet with families within 10 days of  admission to discuss the ELL program choices. Apart from being shown the video and meeting personally with the staff during  the first 10 days at the school, the parents are also invited to two ELL Informational Parent Conferences. In these conferences,  they have an opportunity to view the video as a group and discuss its content and the TBE and ENL programs with each other  as well as with the Assistant Principal, the school’s Parent Coordinator, and the ELL teacher. The parent coordinator, teachers,  and assistant principal collaborate to reach out to parents and inform them of the meetings via email, phone, and written  notices. At the meeting families are also shown a NYC Department of Education video explaining in detail the choices of  program their children have as ELLs in a New York City school. This video is shown in a variety of languages, including Spanish.  The families complete the program selection forms during the 1:1 meetings or during the group meetings and the child is  placed in the appropriate program. Outreach is done by the parent coordinator and the teachers. This year we also hosted an  informational meeting with the International Rescue Committee regarding their summer camp program for students whose  families immigrated to the United States. Parent outreach was done by email and phone.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish (2 periods per week -90 minutes). We have a licensed Spanish teacher, Ms. MacInDoe.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         In order to meet the ELL PD requirement, teachers receive ELL-specific PD that is relevant or aligned to other PD initiatives in  the school or district (e.g., best practices on how to support and sustain ELLs' social and emotional development needs,  including creating a safe and supportive environment that is conducive to learning). Agendas and attendance and Records are  kept for professional development activities.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Once ELL status has been determined, an entitlement letter of ELL status notification is sent to the parent. Annual and  individual meetings are scheduled to discuss language development needs in all content areas with the Language Proficiency  Team. Provisions for interpretation and translation is provided on an as-needed basis.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In an effort to increase our ELL parent involvement, staff members who speak the parent's native language encourage parents  to participate in as many activities as possible. The activities include the Parent Association (PA) and School Leadership Team  (SLT) meetings, orientations, Saturday workshops, High School application process, and After School trips and activities.  Parents are notified in person, over the phone, or in writing. The notices about these activities are translated into the parents'  native language or oral interpretation is provided. Tuesdays are allocated for Parent Engagement. Teachers are encouraged to  reach out to parents through phone calls, Engrade, letters, and text messages. When the drama and percussion classes hold  performances, parents of ELLs are encouraged to attend.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  In the beginning of the school year, the ENL department sends letters to families with students’ most current NYSESLAT score  and their continued entitlement for ENL service. The department hosts two ENL family nights where parents are encouraged to  meet with staff and discuss student progress and goals. We utilize Engrade and Class Dojo to track grades, attendance and  behavior, and access to this data is provided to parents in the beginning of the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ezra Matthias, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Expression Academy @ IS229                                                                              School DBN: 09X229  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Based on the Home Language Identification Survey, a record of adult preferred languages for written translation  and oral interpretation are maintained in ATS: Spanish is the main language; Arabic, French, and Other - 2%.  Copies of said information are shared with our Guidance Counselor, Parent Coordinator, Community Coordinator,  and others.   All written correspondence between the school and students’ families is provided in the language of their choice,  which most often is in their native language. As a result, we use the NYCDOE’s internal translation unit to provide  translations of all school correspondence as needed for:    a.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is a directive on the responsibility that our school system is committed to for the  opportunity of equal access to all rights, opportunity, information, and participation of LEP parents in our school. A  parent will never be denied access to opportunities afforded their families, or to children enrolled at our school. As a  result of these regulations, we have developed systems that will meet the needs of parents of ELLs who speak the  predominant second language, Spanish.   Additionally, Item B of Section VII in the Chancellor's Regulations relates to the conspicuous posting of DOE covered  languages for translation. This appears upon entry to the school near the Security Desk. The school's safety plan  provides that parents who need to communicate with the school, does so in their home language. This is determined  via the Parents Preferred Language Form, which is available as part of the Family Resources through the Office of ELLs.   All school based and consultant agencies will be utilized to this end, including community based organizations that will  be instrumental in meeting the language needs of our parents.
