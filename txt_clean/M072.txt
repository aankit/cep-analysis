This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Mission Statement:    Section 4: CEP Overview      The Lexington Academy seeks to maintain an educational environment in which the entire school community, in  partnership with community based organizations and families, works to ensure that all students are provided with the  skills to become lifelong learners. Through collaboration and standards-driven instructional curricular, we will engage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      all students and assist them in achieving high standards that will teach them to become competent, compassionate,  committed, conscientious, and competitive contributing citizens of the world.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    School Demographics:    The Lexington Academy PS/MS 72 is located on 104th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues in the heart of East  Harlem; serving a multicultural, multilingual community. Our schools serves 658 students in grades 3-Kindergarten  through 8th grade and is an ethnically diverse community comprised of 84% Hispanic, 14% African American, and 2%  White. 13% of the students are English language learners and 25% are students with disabilities.    Collaborations:    At the Lexington Academy we recognize that in order to meet the needs of the whole child, we must partner with  community based organizations to support students and their families in their social and emotional development as  well as through enriching experiences (before, during and after school). Some of our biggest supporters include:  Manchester Football Club--City in the Community, Asphalt Green, El Museo Del Barrio, Turtle Bay Music School,  Midori & Friends, Cycle Kids, Randall’s Island Park Alliance, East Harlem Asthma Center for Excellence, Union  Settlement, and Children's Aid Society. Students receive additional family support services, arts and cultural  enrichment as well as sports and academic supports beyond what the school is able to provide.    Glows and Grows:    The school creates a welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the  civic life of the school, this is an area of celebration for the Lexington Academy. Visitors to our school often comment  that our school is a warm and welcoming place. During the quality review for 2014-2015 the reviewer commented on  how “well versed the parents were about the school, not just their child.” We have worked earnestly to meet and  exceed Chancellor Carranza's vision for strengthening families. Teachers and administrators have been extremely  creative in ways to use the parental engagement days so as to maximize parental engagement. The PTA has been  incredibly accessible and highly visible encouraging parents to take an active role in a variety of ways, including  workshops, PTA meetings, and celebratory events.    Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the New York State Next Generation Learning  Standards. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity  and developing critical thinking skills. As a result of the feedback garnered from our last QR, an area of focus for us  will be rigorous instruction as defined in section 5A below.    Instructional Overview:    The Foundation of Literacy   At The Lexington Academy, we take a balanced approach to literacy. To reach that balance, teachers in Kindergarten,  1 st and 2 nd grades, incorporate a 30-minute daily Phonics based approach, that is aligned to Nonie Leasaux's work  around "Code based learning;" the 'Code' based lessons are woven into each teachers daily instruction. Phonics/Code  lessons focus on carefully sequenced skills that include print knowledge, alphabet awareness, phonological  awareness, phonemic awareness, decoding, vocabulary, fluency, and spelling.   The Writer’s Workshop Model   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      At The Lexington Academy writing begins with a commitment to structuring our literacy day so that students have  time to write, both long chunks of time, to work as professional authors do, cycling through the stages of the writing  process and receiving the feedback that is essential to student growth, and also quick bursts of time for writing as a  tool for learning across the curriculum. The Next Generation Standards requires that students receive these  opportunities to write. Through the writing workshop, students are invited to live, work and learn as writers. They  learn to observe their lives and the world around them while collecting, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing well- crafted narrative and expository texts. Students receive direct instruction in the form of a mini-lesson and a mid- workshop teaching point. The teacher explicitly names a skill that proficient writers use that is within reach for most  of the class, then demonstrates the skill and provides students with a brief interval of guided practice using it.  Students are also given time to write, as they apply the skills and strategies they’ve learned. As students write, the  teacher provides feedback that is designed to move students along trajectories of development. The feedback is given  through one-to-one conferences and small group instruction, and includes instructional compliments and teaching.  The teacher helps a writer imagine what the next challenge is, and equips that writer with the skills and strategies  necessary to begin tackling increasingly more difficult writing projects, ultimately striving for student independence in  the writing process from beginning to end.   The Reading Workshop Model   At The Lexington Academy, reading begins with an assessment of our students’ reading levels (on an A-Z scale) and  then channeling kids towards texts they can read; this approach is based on the work of Richard Allington. Our  students select a stack of books, keeping them in book baggies, so they can progress from one book to another  without wasted time. Students read in school and continue reading at home, carrying books between home and  school. Most keep reading logs in which they record the data on their progress through books and the time spent  reading, studying this data alongside teachers to ascertain patterns in their reading.   Highly effective instruction must always be grounded in assessment. As a school we utilize a web based tool,  Assessment Pro; this tool allows teachers and school leaders to track students’ progress.    Mathematics    At The Lexington Academy we use the GO Math curriculum to support teaching and learning. Go Math is a focused  elementary math curriculum designed to meet the goals of the Next Generation State Standards for Mathematics.  The Standards for Mathematical Practice are integrated throughout the program. Students and teachers are  supported as they advance from concrete to abstract content through the use of models and Math Talk. The  flexibility, comprehensiveness, and rigor of GO Math provide personalized and adaptive 21st-century instruction to  ensure success. Acknowledging that no single “program” can meet all the needs of all learners, we also use  components of Eureka Math and Georgia Math, and our teaching is grounded in the math progressions identified by  the University of Arizona. Teachers engage students in “Cognitively Guided Instruction” word problems engaging  students in interesting complex mathematics stories. Our teachers use Number Talks regularly as introductions to the  day’s mathematical practice, as “warm ups” for other lessons, or as stand-alone extended engagements with  mathematical concepts.   Social Studies   As described in Raising the Bar, the New York City Department of Education is dedicated to making all students  college- and career-ready. In Social Studies, The Lexington Academy works toward achieving this goal through rich  content, unifying themes and big ideas in history, geography, economics, civics, citizenship and government,  integrated with Next Generation literacy standards. The Next Generation Library and EngageNY provide information  on New York’s transition to the Next Generation Learning Standards, which require students to ground reading,  writing, and discussion in evidence from text. At the Lexington Academy our teachers use mentor text to support the  learning of Social Studies. We use the K-8 Social Studies Scope and Sequence to align our instruction, projects, and  field trips to the New York State Next Generation Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Science & Health   Science process skills are based on a series of discoveries. We believe that students learn most effectively when they  have a central role in the discovery process. Inquiry and process skills are an integral part of each unit of study found  in the Foss Kit. The application of these skills allows students to investigate important issues in the world around  them. These process skills are incorporated into students’ instruction as developmentally appropriate. The health of  our students is of utmost importance at The Lexington Academy. Children partake in a range of activities including  weekly physical education classes, programs such as Mighty Milers, tennis, soccer, swimming, cycling, basketball,  Move to Improve in the classrooms, and trips to the farmers’ market. Our health initiatives have led us to become the  recipient of a Platinum Award for Excellence in School Wellness for 4 consecutive years.    Arts   The Lexington Academy is proud to provide a solid and well-rounded foundation in the arts preparing our students  with creative constructive thinking skills as well as the ability to see the world through the beauty of the arts. The  Blueprint provides a standards-based rigorous approach to teaching the arts. It gives the Lexington Academy students  the opportunity to delve deeply into a variety of subjects, while giving their teachers the latitude to create an  instructional program that demonstrates student learning over time and in varied dimensions. More importantly, the  sequential study of art, music, and theater helps our students achieve both a vocation and an avocation. Their  ongoing work enables them to apply for advanced study or for jobs in the arts-related industries that are so important  to the economy of New York City. It also provides them with a source of lifelong enjoyment as they become the future  audience and performers for and of the arts. At the Lexington Academy, the arts motivates students to go beyond the  walls of the classroom and encourages them to take advantage of the rich resources available across New York City in  museums, concert venues, galleries, performance spaces, and theaters, many of which our students have been active  participants and presenters.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   13% of the students are English language learners and 25% are students with disabilities. To meet the needs of our  diverse student population, we provide instructional services in a variety of programs, including dual language classes,  transitional bilingual education, and English as a second language. We also provide special education services across  the continuum of services, including, self-contained, collaborative team teaching, special education teacher support  services, and flexible scheduling. As a “whole”listic approach to educating the whole child, we provide a spectrum of  services including speech and language therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and family support services  which is served by an on-site not-for profit community organization, Union Settlement.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   An area of growth that was recognized by the quality reviewer, and which we were rated proficient was QRI 2.2 Align  Assessment to Curricula, and using ongoing assessments and grading practices, and analyze information from student  learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our school continues to strive to monitor student progress in a systematic manner, specifically in the area of  mathematics. Data systems/Learning trackers (observation logs, observation forms, conferring logs, etc.) will provide  teachers with data, e.g., the degree to which the student has mastered a learning target, who needs re-teaching, who  needs additional challenges, what the next learning target should be, how students should be grouped for small- group instruction, and who needs to be observed more closely for a possible learning intervention, to inform their  instruction. With purposely designed and systematically used learning trackers, we will make better informed  decisions about student placement and instructional pacing.   The data systems/learning trackers will provide support and instruction in areas of students’ weaknesses. School-wide  assessments and NYS Testing Score Information indicate that our students need continued support with multi-step  word problems, particularly when "key" words may be misinterpreted to include any of the four operations. Students  also continue to lack the necessary skills to engage in mental math fluency. Student data/trends from the NYSTP  indicate that our students are scoring below city and state averages with extended/multi-step word problems. This  trend has been supported by classroom and interim assessments, including BOY, MOY, unit assessments, and EOY,  which continue to show that students are struggling with extended math word problems. The skills our teachers need  to focus on are:      1. Increasing math fluency and automaticity--particular to the grade being taught.   2. Increase understanding of Cognitive Guided Math Instruction to support students' skills around decomposing a  word problem.   3. Teachers need to deepen their understanding the expectations of the Next Generation math standards at rigorous  levels.   4. Teachers need to develop skills in implementing rigorous Next Generation aligned assessments and then utilize the  data to drive instructional practices. The teachers need a way to work on streamlining their mathematics instruction  and assessments. They need a way to use data collected to drive instruction so that all learners’ needs are being met.   5. The school’s Theory of Action will play a major role in ensuring that our data systems are being implemented  systematically and cohesively.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         We will refocus our school's Theory of Action to reflect alignment with the school's needs around assessment and  data driven instruction. The Theory of Action is as follows:    Lexington Academy needs a clear, consistent, year-long, school-wide schedule of rigorous standards-based  assessments in ELA and mathematics, with specific grade-level benchmark expectations. Lexington Academy needs  systems and opportunities to analyze and utilize data to drive instruction. Currently, Lexington Academy is  inconsistent in following deadlines and protocols around data.    Our teachers need a way to support struggling readers and/or readers not moving across bands of text complexity.  After reviewing MOSL data [EOY School Year 2018 for 2nd grade], including running records, as well as NYSTP data [for  Met/Not Met and the bottom 10%], the data demonstrates that moving students across text complexity levels is a  problem of practice across all grade levels. During the summative conferences with the teachers, teachers indicated  that they needed additional supports and professional learning around how to move readers. This trend in the literacy  data indicates that students continue to get "stuck" beyond fluency in particular bands at specific grades, i.e., D to E in  kindergarten and M to N in 2nd grade. The skills the teachers need to focus on include:      1. Understanding what developmental reading is for their grade levels and more importantly what the different types  of readers are and how to identify the different types of readers, especially in the early grades.    2. Develop tool kits to address and support the different readers, i.e., Transitional Readers, Emergent Readers and  Early Readers.   3. Our teachers need support in sharpening their practices to support the different types of readers, i.e., improved  coaching of reading--via phonemic awareness and word study (varying by grade and student levels),   1:1 conferences, guided reading groups, and small group instruction all of which support advanced literacy skills. The  advanced literacy skills in particular support our SWDs and ENL students, providing them with diverse opportunities  for practicing their reading skills.    4. Further develop the skills of our special education teachers in the use of Wilson/Fundations to support increased  reading skills and strategies for our SWDs.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   S – By September 2018, 100% of all teacher teams will  create, implement, and analyze robust rigorous, common core  aligned  common  mathematics  and  ELA  assessments.

A Middle of the Year Assessment (Early January 2019 and again in March 2019, depending on the grade’s assessment  math calendar) will be administered and analyzed from PK - 8 to show measure progress from September to January  and January to March.   Teachers will address their students' reading levels accordingly with formalized running records which will be  analyzed for miscues as well as reading comprehension. Coach interim assessments will be administered in  September--with targeted skills instruction to follow--and again in January to assess in reading comprehension in  grades 2--8 (grade 2 will begin in December).  Teacher teams will analyze the data at the micro level to create action plans for targeting areas of deficiency, thus  supporting the goal of 20% gains across the board for ELA and 25% for our lowest third in mathematics.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The SLT feels it is necessary to increase student attendance from 90.6% to 97%. School data from the ATS, specifically  the CA TOOL which tracks student attendance and categorizes the students in one of 5 categories. The CA TOOL  indicates that our students and their families continue to need support in attending school on a regular basis as our  attendance [90%] continues to fall below the city goal of [95%], moreover, our student reading and mathematics state  scores indicate the urgency for our students to attend school regularly. When students feel connected to the adults in  their school setting, they tend to attend school regularly, thus, promoting academic success. Attendance for students  is imperative, and is directly tied into making students feel safe, supported and challenged. Student attendance has a  direct correlation to student engagement, thus impacting student achievement.   Students form important habits early. Students begin to develop responsibility when they come to school on time and  are prepared and ready to learn. Lexington Academy’s school setting provides a unique and supportive environment  in which students learn to assume more personal responsibility as they grow academically, socially, and emotionally.  Teachers, administrators, counselors, and other support professionals assist in helping students adjust to routines,  learn expectations, and develop academic and social competence. In order for students to be successful in school, it is  necessary that students attend school daily and on time.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  S - Student attendance will increase to 97% from the current 90.6%    M - Monthly RESI reports will be examined for progress monitoring, the data provided by this tools will be analyzed  for individual student improvement.    A - Acknowledge student attendance at monthly respect rallies and PTA meetings, highlight students' success with a  dedicated bulletin board and certificates.     R - Student attendance directly impacts student achievement including habits that will affect college and career  readiness.    T – We will continue to monitor student attendance using the categorical student attendance report. The goal will be  to maintain a minimum of 97% attendance by June 2019.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Collaboration and professional development are embedded into the school culture of Lexington Academy. The  school’s schedule is designed to support such teamwork and development of teachers. Each grade-level team is  scheduled to have five to six common preparation periods, including a 90 minute common planning block, and a  weekly professional development period. During common preparation periods, teachers meet as a team to plan,  design assessments, analyze data, and look at student work to inform and revise instruction. Ongoing professional  development is provided to staff through a variety of means, all designed, to meet the affective, cognitive and  behavioral needs of the adult learner. Teachers participate in cycles of literacy professional development supported  by Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP), as well as, math professional development supported by  Dr. Liz Irwin, Math Consultant. In addition to the extensive professional development that teachers receive, many  teachers collaborate as members of school-wide teams, such as, Teacher Leader, PBIS, RTI- A, and Mathematics. In  fact, this is an area of celebration for our school as we received a rating of well-developed in the last quality review on  QRI 4.2.   In discussion with the School Leadership Team and Teacher Leader Team, it was decided that we would continue our  work of conducting learning walks. We have found that the structures and systems we have put into place for  conducting joint classroom learning walks (walk throughs) between administration and staff have increased  collaboration and enhanced job-embedded professional development. This determination was supported by the  findings of administration, after the reviewing of data and reports gathered from classroom observations, as well as,  the positive feedback received from teachers regarding learning walks. The conclusion was reached that, teacher  performance and student achievement, has been and will continue to be positively impacted by, continuing to have  teachers observe best practices of one another. We believe this goal will allow teachers the opportunity to participate  in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement, and support them in  contributing to the success of classrooms and the school. Additionally, this goal will support goal number 5 of our  2018-2019, as one focus/look-for of our learning walks will be on observing students' writing volume and stamina.  Collaborative classroom learning walks allow for the following:     Drive a cycle of continuous improvement by focusing on the effects of instruction.    Administrators and teachers can gather data, which can be used to promote collaborative dialogue regarding      Instruction between teachers and administrators.  Serve as a strategy for providing a school, not an individual teacher, with feedback about what is and is not  working.     The data collected allows the school as a whole to make informed decisions regarding, professional planning   and preparation, classroom environment and instruction.

Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  S. By June 2019, 100% of teaching staff will have participated in a minimum of 3 collaborative learning walks, focused on  specific “look-fors.”    M. Following each collaborative learning walk, the learning walk team that conducted the learning walk will debrief the  walk and complete a “debriefing form”, that names what was observed, wonderings, trends, personal take-aways and  school take-aways. Debriefing forms will be put in a shared google doc that all staff can access. Once a month, at a  Teacher Leader meeting, participants along with administration will analyze the debriefing forms to determine school- wide trends, take-aways, questions and implications.   A. This goal is achievable as we have developed a structure for collaborative learning walks that includes a “Blueprint for  Learning Walks.” The Blueprint delineates the norms, routines and roles/responsibilities for learning walks. An  instructional “look-for” and schedule of teams that will conduct learning walks and teachers that will be visited will be  determined in advance and communicated to all participants.  R. Based on teacher input and data gathered from classroom observations, this goal supports the needs of our school to  continue to embed professional development as a means to improve teacher practice and increase student  achievement. Learning Walks will give administration and teachers relevant, real-time data related to their practices.  T: By October the “Blueprint for Learning Walks” that was developed by the Teacher Leader Team in collaboration with  administration will be distributed to all teachers in order to establish clear expectations related to the purpose and  process for learning walks. By November, the first “look for” will be determined in collaboration with teachers, a  learning walk schedule will be developed and disseminated to staff, and we will begin our initial cycle of collaborative  learning walks. In the spring of 2019 at the conclusion of our last cycle of learning walks, the data gathered from all  learning walks will be reviewed by the School Leadership team in order to determine next steps and goals.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

As a school we follow the Teachers College (TCRWP) Units of Study for writing and implement with fidelity the writing  program in each classroom. All students in grades kindergarten through 8th grade have been immersed in the writing  process.  Teachers  have  received  extensive  professional  development  from  TCRWP  staff  developers  in  the  balanced  approach to writing. Each teacher has the Units of Study for Teaching Writing set of guide books that includes the text  Writing Pathways along with the corresponding mentor texts.   Teachers schedule a daily dedicated time devoted to the writing workshop that includes a mini-lesson, independent  and small group work, partner work, mid-workshop interruption and a share. There are very clear structures for  supporting the writing process in the classroom including the use of rubrics and individualized checklists to support  student growth. The curriculum is a balance of non-fiction and fiction. Each grade level team has worked  collaboratively to create a pacing calendar for their writing units of study. In the spring, teachers begin to  collaboratively plan their units of study for the new academic year. Teachers plan process and anchor charts that  support ELLs and SWDs. They hold conferences and work in small groups with their students and maintain records of  their conferences and group work to inform next steps.    Teachers regularly assess their students’ writing using the On-Demand performance assessments and rubrics found in  Writing Pathways. The assessments are conducted “formally” three times a year and data is entered into the data  collection system-AssessmentPro as well as, a school wide excel spreadsheet. Additionally, teachers conduct On- Demand performance assessments before launching a new writing unit in order to revise their plans in order to meet  students’ needs.   At the end of the school year, teachers prepare for each student a summary portfolio folder that is passed on to their  next teacher. The folder includes the student’s end of year On-Demand performance assessment and a sheet listing  the volume (approximate average number of pages a student writes) and their stamina (approximate average time a  student writes). Additionally, in grades 3-5, each student’s writer’s notebook is given to their next teacher. This allows  for continuity of instruction and for teachers to assess the writing needs of their incoming students.   At the last QR, the reviewer recognized the coherence of instruction, the teacher teams, and the unit plans. The  reviewer noted that a strength of our school was in the area of literacy, rating us well-developed in curriculum and  instruction. As we have established school wide coherence in our implementation and planning of the writing  workshop, it has been determined that, our next step is to establish coherent school wide expectations, guidelines  and practices for supporting our students’ volume and stamina as writers across the content-areas, therefore,  increasing their fluency, engagement, independence, and quality of writing. This goal is aligned to District Four’s  district-wide writing goal.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27      Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  This  goal  was  selected  for  several  reasons,  among  them, our  students'  NYS  Testing  Program  Scores  indicate  that our  students continue to fall short of achieving in the 3 and 4 levels. Thus, is it is imperative that we continue to address  writing, monitoring and supporting our scholars to become proficient writers. We will continue to use the Writing on  Demand Prompts and the accompanying rubrics to assess student achievement. The teachers will, in grade level teams,  analyze for trends and then revise their instruction to address grade wide noticings and individual student needs.      S: By June 2019, 100% of our students will demonstrate gains in fluency and proficiency in writing as measured on the  On-Demand performance-based assessment.     M: Teachers will score student writing using the rubrics/learning progressions found in Writing Pathways. Scores will be  entered into the online data base-AssessmentPro as well as, a school wide excel spreadsheet.     A: Based on assessments administered, that will be conducted a minimum of three times a year. Teachers will do the  following:  Collaboratively  look  at  student  work,  revise  writing  unit  plans  and  lesson  plans  accordingly,  plan  for  small  differentiated group instruction, have goal setting conferences with each student around volume and stamina, conduct  small group strategy lessons to increase volume and stamina, provide necessary scaffolds to support increasing volume  and stamina and teach students to use writing checklists in order to self-monitor and assess.     R: This goal is relevant since we have achieved school wide coherence in our planning and implementation of the writing  workshop and the performance assessments that are conducted, the next step is to now look closely at the assessments  that are administered and other relevant student work through the lens of volume  and stamina, in  order to increase  students’  writing  fluency,  engagement,  independence,  and  quality  of  writing.  Additionally,  this  goal  will  allow  us  to  develop school wide expectations around what volume and stamina should look like in each grade from K to 8th grade, as  well as, the necessary supports that must be in place and strategies that should be taught in order to enhance students’  writing volume and stamina.   T: By the first day of school, each teacher will receive student portfolio folders containing their incoming students’ end of  year On-Demand [prior year’s information]. These assessments will be used by teachers to revise their first unit of study  and  group  students  accordingly.  Teachers  from  K-8  will  administer  and  score  On-Demand  writing  performance  assessments  in  September/October  2018,  January/February  2019,  and  May/June  2019.  At  the  completion  of  each  assessment period and the end of each writing unit of study, teacher teams will look at and analyze student work using  school-wide protocols. Additionally, they will meet with students to set goals and reflect upon goals around volume and  stamina. Beginning in September 2018 until June 2019 teachers will conduct a daily writing workshop that includes a  minilesson, independent writing, conferring/small group work, a mid-workshop interruption and a share.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Our data from the NYS 3rd through 8th grade ELA exams indicate that our students continue to need support in  writing. While our students made gains in writing, as demonstrated by our WOD, the gains were minimal and we  must continue to push our students' writing particularly around informational, narrative, and, opinion. Using school  wide rubric, we will assess students in particular components of writing, i.e., structure [introducing topic, creating an  organizational structure, transitions], development [elaboration], and language conventions.    In December, the first published writing piece will be examined using protocols for looking at student work.   In March, the second published writing will be examined using the same protocol that was used in December,  however, the added piece will be evaluating impact on learning [transfer of writing skills]. For example, we will look at  that the Writing Process Learning Progression, to assess students' needs and next steps for supporting the students.     In June, the final product will be published. Specials will compare the results from the first and second published  pieces and reflect upon the impact they had on student learning.     Part 5b.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The importance of a supportive school environment has such a significant impact on students’ learning and growth,  including major social, emotional and ethical environment. This is met through the strong PBIS currently in place, as  our school has been recognized as an NYC DOE PBIS lab site. In fact during our last QR, we received a rating of well  developed, in part because of the high levels of communication with parents.   Without diminishing from our strength, there is a need for additional support systems to be put in place to increase  parental involvement, to create a welcoming environment for families, providing them opportunities to take  advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school and our families.   The SLT members and the PTA have acknowledged the need to ensure that parents are actively engaged in the school  community including instructional and social components of the school. While we have made many strides in  achieving high levels of parental participation, we also acknowledge that more needs to be done to reach greater  numbers of parents. Aligning with the fundamental practices of what makes a quality school; this goal is aligned with  the DOE’s Quality Review Statement 1.4 which calls for “Maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes  that supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults” and 3.4 which calls for “Establishing a culture  for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve  those expectations."       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   Our school is proud of the parent involvement and engagement. We have noticed through attendance sheets and casual  observations that many of the parents that participate in our school are repeat parents. We want to reach out to the  parents,  that  for  whatever  reasons,  that  don't  access  all  the opportunities our  school  has to offer,  such as  parenting  classes, computer classes, learning walks, opportunities that will support their child's achievement.    S - Increase parental involvement 92% to 100% by the November and March conferences.   M - This goal will be measured by the attendance participation in the Tuesday parent workshops and the November  and March attendance.   A - This goal’s attainability will be achieved through a systemic effort of marketing and parent outreach including but  not limited to: backpacking flyers, posting meetings in highly visible locations throughout the perimeter of the school  and inside the school, ensuring timely phone blasts, e-mail notifications, having teachers make appointments with  every child’s parent, and announcements at PTA.  R - This goal is relevant in that it is aligned with the Chancellor's’ vision of engaging parents in all aspects of school  life. It is also well researched that students’ achievement are directly impacted by parental  involvement/engagement.  T - Parent Teacher Conferences (November 15th, and March 14th, Parent-teacher conferences, and May for at-risk  students).

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The principal organized an extensive hiring team. Together the principal and his team designed targeted questions  that will help meet the cultural and educational needs of the school. Perspective applicants are rated on their  responses to the questions that are aligned to Charlotte Danielson’s Rubric. Teachers are selected from competitive  colleges in NYC and beyond including other states. The principal works collaboratively with the NYC DOE recruiting  office to select candidates that have been pre-screened by the DOE as having met highest recruitment levels.   To ensure retention of our teachers, we have a New Teacher Club which meets once a month. The club is facilitated  by the assistant principal. In this club, the new teachers conduct a book study around the Charlotte Danielson  Framework to support best practices around teaching and learning. Teachers are provided with protocols for safe  sharing of their concerns and needs.   Each teacher is provided with a mentor that is on their grade, area of specialty, i.e., special education, mathematics,  etc...   New teachers meet once a month with their designated supervisors for a check-in on their needs and supports.   The social committee ensures that all new teachers are made part of the extra curricular activities that happen at a  social level in our school.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Teachers, assistant principals, and principal actively participate in professional development provided by Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project. Teachers in grades K—8 participate in a series of instructional professional  development cycles. During these cycles, the teachers actively collaborate on their ELA instruction and it’s alignment  to the Next Generation Standards. Also during these cycles the staff developer demonstrates the highest standards of  instruction. All ELA units of study are completely aligned to the Next Generation Standards. Teachers in grades k—8  attend Teachers College Reading and Writing Project calendar days. The instructional units of study in grades 3k-8 are  also aligned to the Next Generation Standards. All teachers K--8 receive support around their units of study with a  specific concentration around domain 3 component 3b of the  Danielson Rubric. Additionally teachers are supported in developing coherent instruction with a focus on critical  components of planning and preparation: Connection to Next Generation Standards; Essential Questions; Common  Misconceptions; WALT/WILF; and tiered activities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Paraprofessionals will take part in the same job embedded PD that classroom teachers receive. Additionally,  paraprofessionals will take part in the BFSC workshops that provide training to Paraprofessionals. A lead  paraprofessional representative will turn-key every Tuesday afternoon what he has learned from the BFSC workshops.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  We have several parent activities throughout the year that are aligned with Next Generation Standards for PK.  Parents take an active role in the activities. Many of the activities are centered around family life, all about me, and  the community. Parents take part in all of the community based field trips such as, to the police station,  dentist/doctor's offices, library, etc... Parents are completely immersed in career day for the PK students, for example  we have police dads/moms, and doctor dads/moms take part in the classroom.     We follow the School Sampling model for maintaining student records, i.e., growth and development. Parents have  full access to these records and on a monthly basis parents are given an opportunity to meet with their child's teacher  to discuss progress and/or concerns.     Any concerns about early intervention are shared with the Child Study Team, the team is comprised of a social  worker, counselor, speech pathologist, psychologist, special education teacher, and school administrator. The team  then conducts extensive checks on the student through classroom observations. The team will determine next steps  for the student based on the observations and subsequent discussions with the parent.     As early as April ,we implement a transition plan for PK. This includes, read alouds about going to the next grade, At  the start of May, we arrange for buddy visitors in which PK students are partnered with a kindergarten student. The  kindergarten student welcomes the PK student into the classroom. The PK students also begin the process of having  lunch in the cafeteria, although not with other kindergarten children, this gives them a chance to get a sense of what  will be expected of them for the upcoming school year.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      The PK teachers actively take part in the greater school’s planning schedule. Kindergarten curriculum is completely  aligned to the 1—8th grade curricula. The teachers implement the same methodology for ELA (using the workshop  model) and Mathematics, using similar planning templates and instructional techniques. While the vast majority of  our assessments are pre-packaged to meet the needs of our ELA curriculum, teachers do take an active role in making  determinations in areas that do not have “prerequisite” assessments. For example, in mathematics, teachers worked  collaboratively to develop assessments and/or worked with our Staff Developer to design and select the most  appropriate assessments.       4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     While the vast majority of our assessments are pre-packaged to meet the needs of our ELA curriculum, teachers do  take an active role in making determinations in areas that do not have “prerequisite” assessments. For example, in  mathematics, teachers worked collaboratively to develop assessments and/or worked with our Staff Developer, Liz  Irwin to design and select the most appropriate assessments.       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Lexington Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Lexington Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school  year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed   about school activities and student progress. Additionally we will disseminate school wide newsletters that  address  up  to  date  information  from  grades  3K  through  8th  grade.  A  detailed  parent  handbook  will  be  provided which will include an "FAQ Section" with information regarding point people to contact for various  reasons, i.e., attendance teacher, IEP teacher, school schedule and list of CBOs as well as the school facebook,  twitter, and website .   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   The Lexington Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will  be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

This  indicates how essential the Title III after school program is in the development of language  acquisition and their academic development.   Speaking  Instruction will emphasize social, cultural and historical content to build fluency and develop  language and vocabulary acquisition.  These strategies will include vocabulary development  through repetition, social interaction and opportunities to practice the language.  Students will  practice accountable talk and engage in student-to student conversation with feedback.  To  develop grammar, teachers will model sentence structure and syntax and descriptive language.   Listening  In order to acquire appropriate grade-level vocabulary the following will be used to implement  instruction.  Instruction will expose students to idiomatic and academic language and engage  students in interactive read-alouds.  Students will engage in conversational practice with  students.  Teachers will model accountable talk with sentence starters.  To build listening  stamina, teachers will begin with short read-alouds and move on to longer texts.  Students will be  exposed to books on tapes and engage in activities with sentence starters/sentence frames.   Reading  To develop grade level vocabulary and academic vocabulary students will engage in varies  meaningful and authentic activities.  To read and comprehend in English on grade level teachers  will scaffold reading development and vocabulary instruction.  Teacher will model and teach  students how to use words from a question to form a response.  Students will make text-to-text  connections and text-to-self connections.  Teachers will use Reader’s Theatre and ample  literature for grade level in various genres.   Writing  To develop voice in writing, teachers will share good examples of mentor texts with students.  Teachers will use wordless picture books so that students can create and sequence their own  stories.  Use various graphic organizers (i.e. story maps) so that students can sequence and  transfer information from one genre to another.  Teachers will model the writing  process.  Students will use shared writing techniques and write-alouds and use a self-checklist  when writing.  They will practice correct sentence structures and writing techniques such as  using the correct subject-verb agreement.  The Lexington Academy Title III after school program will provide MLLs in grades  Kindergarten through 8th grade with instruction on Thursdays and Fridays.  The program is  scheduled to begin in January 2019 through April 2019. The after school program will provide  MLLs with an additional 180 minutes of small-group, targeted instruction to address the needs of  MLLs  by building their academic language in reading comprehension, vocabulary  acquisition,  writing strategies and structures for composing evidenced-based responses.   The program is scheduled from January 2019 through April 2019 from 2:30 pm to 5:30  pm.  Three teachers will work with four groups of students ranging in varied levels of language  proficiency (Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding).

Ms. Ramos will work with grades K-1 across the modalities and the activities and lessons will be  differentiated by proficiency and grade level.   Ms. Rodriguez will with grades 2-3 across the modalities and the activities and lessons will be  differentiated by proficiency and grade level.  Ms. Javier will with grades 4-5 across the modalities and the activities and lessons will be  differentiated by proficiency and grade level.   Due to different proficiency levels in the middle school (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and  Expanding), all three teachers  will work across the modalities and the activities and lessons will  be differentiated by specific proficiency and grade level.   The number of sessions and the hours for the after school program is 6 hours per week / 3 hours  each session on Thursday and Friday, for a total of 25 sessions equaling a total of 75 hours.  In order to initiate and/or maintain the Title III program, other school funding will be utilized as  needed.    The after school program will have two teachers that are TESOL certified and one teacher is  bilingual certified.  Students will be grouped based on their proficiency level (Entering,  Emerging Transitioning, and Expanding), their percentile ranking in the English Language  Modality levels (Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing) and grade level.  Students' language  of instruction will be primarily in English with supports in their home language.   MLLs will be immersed in pre-reading, and after-reading activities that will support language  and literacy development. Additionally we will provide MLLs with support as they are engaged  in text discussion and targeted research. The students will be immersed in activities that promote  Bilingual Common Core Learning Progression Standards around speaking, listening, reading and  writing.  To support instruction and language development, teachers will use a variety of materials  including technology-based activities.  Teachers will also utilize rubrics for speaking, listening,  reading and writing to assess and monitor progress.  Students will listen to books on audio,  engage in reading theatre and read their independent books.  They will read and/or listen to non- fiction text from Epic! website as well as take the assessments online for the book they  read.  Teacher will use varies graphic organizers to scaffold writing.  For vocabulary  development and phonemic awareness/decoding, teacher will use Words Their Ways.  Entering  and Emerging will use Words Their Ways.  Transitioning and Expanding will use Readers  Theatre.  Across all proficiency levels we will use read-alouds and audio books online such as  Epic!  Across all proficiency levels for reading and writing we will use Moving into English,  Amazing English and Decodable books.  Across proficiency levels in middle school, we will use  non-fiction texts (from a variety of sources) for all modalities.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use TCRWP to maintain data and assessment information for our ELLs.  In grades K-6 the assessments include but are not  limited to writing on demand, concepts of print, upper-case letter identification lower-case letter identitification, sound  identification,  running record which includes students' level and accuracy rates as applicable.  We also use the Estrellita  program in K-2        nd       grade, which has its own assessment and record keeping system.  For our bilingual classrooms this  data shows, that our Spanish dominant students, most often show mastery of early literacy skills in their native languge before  demonstrating mastery of early literacy skills in English.  This finding in consistent with our biligual instructional model and  research emergent on bilingualism.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs in a variety of ways.  We use both formal and informal data to assess our  students and their growth over time.  We examine how the students in our Transitional Bilingual Program fare as compared to  students in our Freestanding ELL program, and our DL program.  The formal data includes the number of students passing the  NYSESLAT and meeting  proficiency in ELA, Math and Science.  Informol data includes teacher observations, running records,  TCWRP, Estrellita, and teacher made assessments.  The combined data provide for a holistic picture of the performance of  each student, and in turn allows for reflective professional practice.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The use of data is used to guide instruction for our ELL students.  This service is provided to our ELLs who are encountering  academic   difficulties.  Students improvement are measured by reliable and valid assessments. The RTI model is based on three tiers of   istruction and intervention support.  These instructional support help to differentiate instruction and meet individual students'  needs. Students can be placed into Tier 2 or Tier 3 if teacher recommends  that  more rigorous and intensive academic support  is needed.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT data indicates that students at Lexington Academy reach proficiency  in speaking and listening prior to achieving  profiency in the reading and writing strands.  These findings are consistent with reasearch in second language  acquisition.   Across grades and across proficiency levels, and with both special education, and general education students,  students perform better on the speaking/listening portion of the NYSESLAT than on the reading/writing portion of the  exam.  Our NYSESLAT data also shows that across the grades students are achieving profiency and  passing the exam.  Students  who begin as ELLs in bilingual kindergarten classes do achieve proficiency in all four modalities as they progress through the  grades; this is especially true when students remain in a bilingual program, i.e., DL, TBE for the amount necessary to support  them in the acquiesnce of language.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding English as a Second Language (ESL)  Our ESL program follows pull/push-out model.  We have one licensed ESL teacher who services all students in the ESL  program.  ESL  students are serviced in small groups by proficency level.  Students in freestanding ESL who are beginner or  intermedite   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         receive eight periods a week  for 45 minutes each period coming to a total of 360 minutes of ESL as directed by the  Chancellor's  Regulation Part 154.  Students who achieved an commanding level in the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT receive 180  minutes  of ESL per  week. As per CR Part 154 students that achieved commanding and FELLs receive 90 minitues per week in ESL  instruction.  In addition,  the students receive small group instruction and support in reading and writing strategies  following the  Common Core Learning Standards and the Learning Standards for English as a Second Language.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Transitional Bilingual Program  There are  Spanish/English Transitional Bilingual classes from grades 2nd- 5th,  in our school. The Transitional Bilingual  Program at PS 72 is designed to service entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding  English  Language Learners. It is a program that educates ELLs using both English and Spanish. Our model of instruction  recognizes the importance of supporting the long term linguistic academic and cognitive development of ELLs through  their native language.  The instructional program follows the designated model for entering, emerging, transitioning,  expanding, and commanding students. That is,  the students receive 60% of their instruction in their Native Language,  in this case Spanish and 40% of their instruction in English when they are entering.  As the students  progress through  the program,  the percentage of native language instruction decreases in favor of more time spent in English.  By the  time the students reach the commanding level,  the instructional program is 75 percent English, 25 percent native  language. The transitional  bilingual progrom meets all of the New York City Department of Education and New York  State guidelines as outlined in CR Part 154.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Dual Language  Our Dual Language model for kindergarten is self-contained with a Bilingual licensed teacher. It provides 50% of  literary  instruction in English and 50% of literacy instruction in Spanish. The classes consist of English proficient students and  Spanish   dominant students who are ELLs (50--50 model in as much as it is possible and feasble).  Our Dual Language model for  grades K--3 consist of the stand alone model. We follow the tradional practice of Color-coded blue for English and red  for Spanish.  Our instructional approach is that both English and Spanish classes follow the Commom Core Learning  Standards in all subject areas. In addition, teachers also use Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshops, and  Estrellita curricula.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 At Lexington Academy each teacher is required to submit a detailed program schedule to the administration  in September of each year. These program schedules outline the days of the week and amount of instructional time dedicated  to explicit ESL, explicit ELA, explicit HLA, and content-area instruction.These program schedules are reviewed to ensure that all  eligible students in the Transitional Bilingual,  Dual Language, and Freestanding ESL programs receive the mandated number of  instructional minutes according to proficiency level.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   We currently utilize the workshop model for both reading and writing through extensive professional  development.  In addition, we receive  support from staff developers from Teachers College Columbia University, workshops  provided by the Office of English Language Learners,  and our own literacy coaches.  The workshop model is used for HLA and  ELA instruction. Writing and  math instruction are provided in both Spanish and English in bilingual classrooms. All grades use   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Go Math Curriculum and Engage NY; math is also provided in both Spanish and English. The ESL teacher uses Harcourt’s  Moving into English program to  support the development of English oral language skills during ESL instruction. ELL students in  grades 3-7 receive integrated social studies and technology instruction in our school technology lab. Laptop computers are also  available for all classes in grades 3-5. Students in grades K-2 have regular access to computers in their classrooms and take  turns working independently on the computer during literacy and math stations. All of our classrooms are equipped with  smart boards that are used to maximize comprehensible input during all instructionalperiods but particularly during ESL/ELA  instructional time; the technology is shared among all classroom teachers. In bilingual classrooms, native language support is  provided in all subject areas including HLA, writing, math, science, and social studies. The amount of time spent instructing in  Spanish declines as children progress  through the grades.  In addition, our ESL teacher uses the “Moving Into English” program  as one of her resources,  particularlykindergarten through 3rd grade. This is a complete program that incorporates speaking,  listening, reading, and writing skills using a variety of strategies. In addition, she uses Words Their Way for word study.  In the  upper grades (grades 3 -5) teachers use Santillana’s “Lenguaje Y  Comunicación” as part of the Native Language Arts  curriculum. Content areas are generally taught in English in the upper grades, providing scaffolding and support as needed.  Newcomers are provided with content area instruction in their Native Language in small groups whenever possible. Lower  grade bilingual classes provide content area instruction in Spanish. Curriculum materials are available in both languages. In  addition, all bilingual classes are equipped with a variety of genres in their classroom libraries in both languages.  Furthermore,  teachers  use their common preps for planning and ensuring that lessons are aligned with the CCLS .          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   We ensure that ELLs are properly evaluated in their native language in a variety of ways. In our early childhood Dual  Language classrooms (K--2) students are evaluated using Estrellita-Accelerated Beginning Spanish Reading Program,  Spanish  language literacy assessments and various Spanish informal assessments. The phonics program Estrellita provides additional  information to lower-grade classroom teachers and service providers.  Also running records are conducted using Spanish texts  and the F&P spanish assessment.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Insruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups in the following ways:  a. SIFE students have access to AIS reading and math instruction, ESL pull-out/push-in services and bilingual SETSS instruction  (as needed) .When appropriate, basic literacy skills are first taught in Spanish by classroom teachers or support staff. We make  every effort to provide SIFE students with content area material that is appropriate to their grade and reading level.  b. Our newcomers are most often placed in Transitional Bilingual Classes and benefit from the support of a licensed bilingual   teacher. Therefore, they have access to native language supports across the content areas and access to a teacher who has a   sense of respect for native language and culture of origin. The bilingual teacher works to maintain and develop additional skills  in   the students' native language while also teaching English Language Arts and English as a Second Language. For newcomers  who   are not in our Transitional Bilingual Program, our ESL teacher services  them  via our Freestanding ESL program.  Newcomers  receive the mandated number of ESL instruction as outlined in NYS CR Part 154. Additionally, newcomers are invited to   participate  in our extended day period,  our  Saturday language sophistication, and or after- school  program which aims to  prepare students to take the NYSESLAT, NYS MATH and ELA Exams.  c.   ELLs going on 4--6 years of service, are monitored closely,whether in the TBE, NLE, or FS-ESL.  The NYSESLAT data is  analyzed  and comparative analysis is made with the NYS ELA and Math tests. These students are also monitored by their classroom  teachers  and their language needs are addressed through highly-differentiated literacy and math instruction.  Students are provided   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      with   additional  English language support either through the extended day period, or through our after-school Tittle III program.     d. Our plan for long term ELLs is to look carefully at our formal and informal data in order to determine areas of instruction for   targeted intervention. We aim to determine why students have not yet reached proficiency (diagnostic) in English and then  tailor our instruction to meet the English language needs of long term ELLs.  Some our long term ELLs are ELLs-SWDs; who  work with their related service  providers to bolster English language skills via small groups or one-on- one instruction.  When  appropriate we consider whether our ELL-SWDs should have their language of instruction changed on their IEPs.  Our long  term ELLs are also invited to receive support on Extended Day, AIS reading program,  Saturday language sophistication and/or  after school program.       e.  Our plan for former ELLs in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient is to provide as much support as possible.  Some students  continue to receive additional English language  support  by the AIS bilingual reading teacher.  Additionally, students are also  invited to participate in our extended day period,  Saturday test sophistication,  and or after shool program to help prepare  students to take the NYS  ELA and Math Exam.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our teachers use VAKT supports to provide the highest levels of differentiated instruction, including, Visual, Auditory,  Kinesthetic and Tactile supports which come in the form of research based ELL instruction such as TPR.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment.  Our ELL-SWD students follow the same curriculum as our general education students; teachers adapt  and supplement the curriculum as appropriate.    Reading and Writing are taught using Teacher’s College Reading and Writing  Workshop.  Math units are designed by grade level teams.  Examples of supplemental programs that teachers of ELL-SWD  students at Lexington Academy use include Touch Math, Handwriting without Tears, and Wilson Fundations.     Instruction is differentiated across the content areas to meet the needs of our ELL-SWDs.  Teachers design units and lessons  that give our learners multiple points of access to content including incorporation of visual aids, appropriately leveled texts  and native language instruction.   Our ELL-SWD students are made aware of their learning goals via ongoing independent  conferences that take place with the teacher on a regular basis.       We have a bilingual AIS and bilingual SETSS teacher that offer both push-in and pull-out services to ELL-SWD students at our  school.  We also have a bilingual counselor and a bilingual guidance counselor that support the emotional needs of our  students.   We also have two bilingual speech therapists on staff.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Lexington Academy provides extensive targeted intervention programs for our ELLs in all academic areas including math,  literacy and content areas. Academic intervention for ELLs comes in several forms.  Students receive targeted instruction in a  small group.  Other interventions for ELLs include our bilingual AIS program, our bilingual SETSS program, and our ESL  teacher.  We invite ELL students to participate in our ELA, Math and NYSESLAT test sophistication after-school and Saturday  programs.  Our clinical staff is also well equipped to support the socio-emotional needs of our ELLs.  We have a bilingual social  worker, guidance counselor, occupational therapist and speech therapists, and psychologist.  Intervention programs are taught  primarily in English; however, newcomers and children in our early childhood transitional bilingual program receive instruction  in Spanish.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       We are in our 5        th       year of being a Teachers College Readers and Writers Workshop Project (TCRWP) school; as such we  are continuing to refine our balanced literacy instruction school-wide.  Teachers of ELLs and ELL-SWDs have access to  specialized professional development days at Teachers College that address implementation of balanced literacy for these sub- groups of students.  For this academic year we are continuing  the Spanish-language phonics program Estrellita in our K- 2nd  grade Transitional Bilingual and Dual Languge classrooms.  In addition, we are using Go Math as our Math Curriculum  throghout all the grades and enhancing it with Engage Modules.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All services and programs of ELLs will continue.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are fully integrated into the Lexington Academy community. ELL students are considered for all programs, after- school academic programs, music programs, school plays, and assemblies (usually performed in both Spanish and English). ELL  students actively participate in our after-school soccer program and track team. While ELLs make up approximately 16  percent  of our school population, they make up a much larger percentage of students actively participating in after-school programs as  mentioned above. Specific to our ELLs is the Title III after-school program specifically designed for ELLs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Laptops are available for all students in grades 3—5. Students in grades K—2 have regular access to computers in their  classrooms and take turns working independently on the computer during literacy and math sessions.  Students in our Middle  School participate in a state of the art computer lab in which graphic design is provided as an elective. Additionally we provide  a Girls Who Code program that has a large ELL participation. Our school libraries, both elementary and middle school, are  equipped with equitable access to books in Spanish. The school librarian, also provides digital acces to books in approximaelty  45 languages. All classroom teachers have access to laptops, and a classroom smart board which aids to maximize  comprehensible input during all instructional periods but especially during ESL/ELA instruction.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is offered through a variety of methods, including, through the use of Total Physical Response (TPR),  through scaffolding, and in small flexible groups. Native language support is provided in all subject areas including HLA, writing,  math, science and social studies.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Lexington Academy offers unique services to our ELL students, services that support the ELLs’ ages and grade levels. We have  an Bilingual AIS teacher that works primarily with upper-grade elementary students focusing on the needs of the older  students, particularly in the content areas. We also have a bilingual SETSS reading teacher that meets the emerging needs of  our younger ELLs.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Laptops are available for all students in grades 3—5. Students in grades K—2 have regular access to computers in their  classrooms and take turns working independently on the computer during literacy and math sessions.  Students in our Middle  School participate in a state of the art computer lab in which graphic design is provided as an elective. Additionally we provide  a Girls Who Code program that has a large ELL participation. Our school libraries, both elementary and middle school, are  equipped with equitable access to books in Spanish. The school librarian, also provides digital acces to books in approximaelty  45 languages. All classroom teachers have access to laptops, and a classroom smart board which aids to maximize  comprehensible input during all instructional periods but especially during ESL/ELA instruction.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Each school year, the AIS Bilingual teacher, the Bilingual SETSS teacher and the ESL teacher, are assigned to the task of  enrolling any new ELL students.  They ensure that all newly enrolled ELL students are properly processed. These highly  qualified teachers ensure that students needing the NYSITELL, the NYSESLAT and/or any other assessments or specialized  needs including special education services are met. Parents meet one-on-one with a staff member to receive an overview of  the programs offered for ELLs at Lexington Academy.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Students in the transitional bilingual classes are learning English as a second language.  Students in our Dual Language classes   who are English proficient are learning Spanish as a second language.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a.  In our Dual Language Program both our EPs and ELLs receive an equal amount of time in the target  language.  Our kindergarten--3rd grade Dual Language has 50% of literacy instruction in English and 50%  of literacy in Spanish.  Students alternate daily for instruction learning the following subjects in both  languages; literacy (reading and writing)/word study/phonics.  b. The Dual Language Program, from kindergarten through 3rd both EPs and ELLs are integrated all  day.  One teacher provides instruction to ensure that students learn to read, write and speak in both  English and Spanish.  The areas that are taught seperately are Art,   Music, Physical Education, Drama and Science when provided by the specials.      c. The DL program follows a stand alone approach and uses the roller coaster model for instruction, the  exception is in 2nd grade in which the day is split into both English and Spanish on alternating days.  By  3rd grade students are immersed in cultural literacy that supports learning across the curriculum in both  English and Spanish.  d.  In Lexington Academy we use the stand alone model.  e. In our Dual Language kindergarten and first grade the emergent literacy is taught simultaneously.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. Our professional development plan includes time set aside at our weekly grade-level professional development meetings  to discuss the specific needs of our ELL students and what strategies we can use to help them and to make the grade-level  curriculum accessible to them. Our teachers develop and discuss the different strategies and best practices under the four  domains using the Charlotte Dnielson's for Teaching.   They also  draw upon Mary Capellini's text "Balancing Reading and  Language Learning" as a resource for educating our ELL personnel.   Most of our bilingual and ESL teachers continue to grow  professionally through  outside professional development opportunities as well.  Staff members attend professional learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         days   at Teachers College related to meeting the instructional needs of ELLs.  We also have an ELL Inquiry Team that meets twice a  month.  The ELL Team is dedicated to analyzing assessment data and researching and exploring best practices in the field of  ELL instruction with the goal of improving outcomes for our ELL students.     Our teachers attends various workshops to support the ELL population in which they focus on fundamental elements of  classroom   instruction and effective pedagogy for ELLs.  During PDs or common planning time teachers share best practices with each  other   to help support ELL students and to ensure that their lessons are in aligment with the Common Core Learning  Standards.  Teachers   also analyze data to identify specific instructional needs for promoting student achievement.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our bilingual guidance counselor and bilingual parent coordinator are available to assist parents and students with the middle   school application process. Several informational meetings are held prior to the start of the application period and students  are   taken on tours of neighborhood middle schools. Parents of ELLs are informed of the services that their students are entitled to  in   middle school (mandated ESL, SETSS, etc) so that they can better advocate for their children at the middle school level. A  middle   school fair is also held in October to provide students with an in-house opportunity to take part in the transitional process.     All staff receive a minimum of 7.5 hours of ELL training both on- and off-site.  On-site, professional development periods are   dedicated to topics related to ELLs including: understanding the NYSESLAT exam and adapting mini-lessons to make input  more   comprehensible for all learners.  Off-site, teachers attend ELL related workshops that are then shared with the staff as a whole  at   professional development.  These workshops take place at Teachers College, and Bank Street. Our ELL Inquiry Committee  meets twice a month to discuss issues related to ELLs and methods in which best practices in the   field of ELL education can be applied to our entire student population. At every PD staff are required to sign in and strict  records are maintained as required by federal guidelines for all Title I schools.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Lexington Academy  has a developed a parent compact statement. The compact outlines parental involvement. Parents are  encouraged to participate in all aspects of the school community and this is reflected in the parental response to the Learning  Environment Survey with an average parent satisfaction rate of 99%. Parents are volunteers in the classroom, during morning  line-up or at lunch time. Parents are actively encouraged to take part in RTI training, coffee time with the parent coordinator  and in PTA meetings where there is complete translation for our ELL parents.  In keeping with the Chancellor's Regulation,  all  documents are translated for our parents and sent home in all language necessary and available,  but at the very least in both  English and Spanish.  They are welcome to participate in class trips such as; when classes go swimming, tennis or neighborhood  walks.  In addition, we have Cookshop program where parents learn healthy eating habits.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We offer parent Cookshop which provides families with access to healthy recipes and fresh groceries.  The majority of the  parents that take this class are parents of ELLs.  The NYC Department of Health has hosted a variety of workshops in English  and Spanish for our parents related to asthma. Our parents particpate in the annual TC English Language Support workshops  facilitated in Spanish. We have a long and strong partnership with El Mueso Del Barrio to provide rich cultural enrichment  opportunities to our families and their children these are held both in-house and at the museum.     Parents have an active role in our school community and their voices are valued.  Throughout the school year the Parent  Coordinator sends home a variety of surveys.  These include the Title I and Title III needs assessments.  The Parent Coordinator  encourages parents to become active participants in the  Title I and Title III needs assessments. We maintain a Facebook Page  that hosts all materials and school-wide information in both English and Spanish.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Antonio Hernandez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Lexington Academy                                                                              School DBN: 04M072  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
