This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 295 is a community that understands that students have both talents and challenges. We believe that each child  has the potential to meet high standards. Our flexibility comes in creating individual plans that provide students with  specific supports that help them meet the standards. By nurturing strengths and talents, as well as recognizing that all  children learn in different ways, we believe that an arts integrated curriculum and a character development focus  cultivates a more meaningful discovery of self. We strive to support students socially, academically, culturally and  artistically by incorporating Universal Design for Learning in all areas of the students’ school life. Our strong   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      professional development program provides ongoing learning and leadership opportunities for all staff members,  while offering students an exemplar for becoming lifelong learners and leaders of the future.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.     PS 295 is an elementary school that was established to serve the growing population in the Greenwood Heights  neighborhood. At its inception in 1994, PS 295 began with one solitary Pre-K class, one teacher and one  paraprofessional. Over the past twenty years, the school has grown tremendously. Today PS 295 is a community  school that serves a diverse population of 412 students. The school population comprises 6% Black, 46% Hispanic,  31% White, 11% Asian students and 6% other. The student body includes 18% English language learners and 28%  special education students. Boys account for 53% of the students enrolled and girls account for 47%.       With a deep commitment to educating the whole child, PS 295 strives to provide developmentally appropriate,  standard based instruction through integrated teaching practices. At PS 295, every student receives rigorous  instruction in Reading, Writing and Math. Science in the lower grades is taught by the classroom teachers through  hands-on learning. Second, Third and Fourth Graders receive rigorous science instruction by our Science Teacher. In  addition our students are provided with the opportunity to receive instruction in Drama, Music, Visual Arts, Physical  Education and Creative Movement. Through parent support we have been able to have a full time music teacher.  Through the generosity of our local council member, we have received grants from the Brooklyn Arts Council to  support our dance and art programs. Collaborative parent and community partnerships foster a love of learning,  ensuring a sustainable future for all children.       During the 2016-2017 PS 295 began a three year initiative to train all K, 1st and 2nd grade teachers in a phonics based  program. The first phase began in the Spring of 2017 with a K, and 1st Grade teacher, as well as the Academic Coach  and IEP Teacher becoming Orton-Gillingham trained. The second phase, 2017-2018 was for all 2nd Grade teachers  and Speech Pathologists to receive training in Recipe for Reading, as well as our IEP Teacher receiving training in Level  1 SPIRE. The third phase will continue during the 2018-2019 with addition of the newly created Teacher's College  phonics program. Also to help increase student engagement our IEP Teacher and Visual Art Teacher participated in  The Power of Art Conference to explore ways to use art to increase literacy in diverse learners. This next school year  our Visual Arts Teacher will be on Sabbatical and use this time to create "Classroom Art Tool Kits" for PS 295 to help  teachers bring more art into our curriculum across all grades and subjects.      For the past 7 years we have been using PBIS as a school wide initiative to promote a culture of responsibility, respect  and safety. This past year we moved to a "Respect Initiative", as a focus lens for PBIS. Because Social/Emotional well- being is integral for a child to sustain attention and focus, as well as feel confident as a learner, PS 295 introduced  students to “Mindfulness” training provided by Mission Be in 2014. As a result of this work, a cluster called "Seeds of  Kindness" to support the social/emotional well being of our students was initiated in 2015 and continues today. For  the 2016-2017, PS 295 also worked with staff on developing a culture of "Growth Mindset." In the 2017-2018 school  year, PS 295 continued to work on the Social/Emotional well-being of the students through additional mindfulness  training, continuation of the Seeds of Kindness cluster and a partnership with Align Brooklyn through our relationship  with Wellness in the Schools. This past Spring PS 295 has been given the privilege of being a part of Thrive NYC. Our  staff has begun participating in Professional Development opportunities with Candice Perrier, a school mental health   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      consultant. This year PS 295 has had an increase in children with or without IEPs who are currently in temporary  housing. what led to these families being in temporary housing often was one or more traumatic events. PS 295 is  aware that not only have these students been impacted by the trauma they have experienced but other students  have also had traumatic events happen in their lives that at times interfere with learning (domestic violence, divorce,  abuse, injury, immigration, etc.) PS 295 has begun to look at trauma and it's impact on behavior and how we need to  be better equipped to deal with our students effected by trauma. During the 2018-2019 we will continue developing a  culture of "Growth Mindset." In the 2018-2019 PS 295 will continue looking at how trauma impacts social/emotional  development and learning, as well as develop a toolkit for working with our children who have experienced trauma so  we do not re-traumatize them. In 2018-2019 PS 295 will continue to work with Candice Perrier to focus on our  students who come from temporary housing.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Despite the high level of intervention our students receive on a daily basis and the academic gains they continue to  make, PS 295 believes our SWD can exceed the expectations we have set forth for them in their IEPs. Our SWD  students tend to be literal thinkers, struggling with questioning, social language and social skills. This is especially true  for our ASD students. In the past PS 295 engaged an ASD Consultant, who helped us develop classroom environments  and strategies, impacting upon social/emotional growth, as well as adjusting the classroom environment to promote  focus and attention, foster independence, which in turn impacts upon academic achievement. In 2018-2019 PS 295  will continue to incorporate the skills and techniques we have learned from Lauren Hough, our ASD consultant in  setting up our classroom environments at the beginning of the year to promote classroom environments that are  ready to meet the academic and social/emotional challenges of all our students. Some of our students in temporary  housing also are SWD, which at times adds another layer of complexity. Students in temporary housing, especially  those in city shelters, need a lot more emotional support before a teacher can get to the academics, a lot more  reassuring them they’re fine-we will be here. We find that kids in the shelter can shut down because they’re trying to  figure out who’s who and where do they belong. It requires more nurturing from our teachers and more  accommodations for these students. In 2018-2019 PS 295 will continue to work with Candice Pierrer to focus on our  students who come from temporary housing.   PS 295’s ENL population has become more diverse over the past few years. For the 2017-2018 school year we had one  full time and one part time ENL teacher. We continue to use both a push in and pull out model for instruction based  on the students’ level on the ENL scale of language acquisition and the size of the group needing instruction. We  continue focus instruction on the acquisition of academic language which will support our students in all aspects of  learning. This model has proven to be effective for our ENL students. The struggle for our ENL students seems to be  most evident when the student also has other learning deficits and/or special needs. These students tend to make  less movement on the ENL scale of language acquisition.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to our School Quality Snapshot, the following are areas of note and/or improvement:   ● The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-2017 was 94.6%   ● Our students exceeded the city and district average on the state math & ELA tests   ● Our former 5th grade students exceeded both the city & district averages of 6th grade pass rate in all courses   ● 96% of our parents are satisfied with the education their child is receiving. (exceeds city average; meets district  average)   ● 93% of our parents believe the school forms effective partnerships with families and the community.(exceeds city  average; meets district average.)    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      According to our January, 2015 Quality Review (Well Developed Overall):   ● Area of Celebration:    o “The school has created and adapted rich, cohesive curricula in all content areas that is consistently reflected upon  and refined to address the needs of all learners and incorporates ever increasing levels of rigor.” This area of  celebration connects directly to the element of Rigorous Instruction which is an integral component of the Framework  for Great Schools. Over the past years, we have reflected on our curricula and refined it so that it addresses all  students' needs and provides instruction that is rigorous.    ● Area of Focus:    o “Across the vast majority of classrooms all students are engaged in activities with rigorous cognitive demands  including high levels of discussion. The use of various protocols in classrooms provides students with tools to extend  their thinking, make meaning and take ownership of their learning.” PS 295 believes indicator 1.2 on our Quality  Review (January, 2015) continues to be an area of focus for our school. In order to develop the academic and personal  behaviors necessary for students to achieve a mindset that supports higher standards in this area, our teachers also  need to be given the tools to shift their mindset from teacher driven to student centered.      Despite our success with a rigorous curriculum, we want to continue to provide a consistency of protocols that will  support our students as they move through the grades. One way to accomplish this would be through the elements of  Supportive Environment and Collaborative Teachers found in the Framework for Great Schools. In order to begin the  year with the best possible support for the students, the administrative cabinet created a set of explicit expectations  to foster a supportive environment for classroom management. This will help develop teacher pedagogy from a  coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the Academic and Personal Behaviors  incorporated in NYC DOE College and Career Readiness Benchmarks and Danielson Framework for Teaching.      As our overall population grows, so does our SWD. In the 2018-2019 school year, out of 15 classes, 13 of those 15 will  be ICT classes. As well as the increase in integrated co-teaching students, we continue to have children receiving  related services only (OT, PT, Speech and/or Counseling) throughout all our classes on all grades. PS 295 has a group  of highly trained, experienced, dedicated Related Service Providers. All related services are provided on site and  delivered using a combination of the push in and pull out model. This past year we had a number of students who  were living in temporary housing, more specifically NYC Shelters,. These students came at all different times during  the school year bringing their own set of challenges for both the students and teachers. PS 295 continued to give all  students the supports needed to be able to be the best learner possible, but teachers in all grades are provided with  strategies and support from the IEP teacher, Academic Coach, as well as the related service providers to help SWD  and our students in temporary housing meet grade level expectations.       In 2016-2017 our school began participating in the "Algebra for All Initiative." Because of our acceptance in this  program our 5th Grade became departmentalized, allowing one highly qualified teacher to teach mathematics and  the other content areas. In order to help prepare future students for the rigors of A #4 A Program we developed a  school math initiative to deepen content understanding through problem solving, conversation, and "productive  struggle." During the 2017-2018 year we continued with this initiative. Twenty-seven of our teachers (all grades  except Pre-K) participated in Math Metamorphosis to support teachers in developing their expertise in rigorous  evidence-based and research-validated methods, including Content Coaching, classroom discourse development,  robust lesson design and reflection, and refinement of teacher pedagogy. PS 295 also formed a Math Committee  which mission is to provide a high quality, challenging and accessible math education for all our students. Our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      instruction will help them develop a balance of problem solving abilities, strong computational skills and fact fluency.  During 2018-2019 PS 295 will continue the mission that in order for students to think like and become  mathematicians, the math curriculum needs to foster curiosity and must provide students the chance to struggle with  meaningful problems, discuss possible and reasonable solutions with their peers, create mathematical arguments,  and place these arguments before a group of their peers who can provide validation and feedback. Students need to  have multiple opportunities to construct meaning through talk and collaboration. They need to understand how to  follow procedures and use algorithms but more importantly understand why these procedures and algorithms work.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K295   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   452   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths:    ● Percentage of students meeting or exceeding grade level standards on NYS ELA test increased from 41% in 2015 to  54% in 2016, to 57% in 2017.   ● Percentage of students meeting or exceeding grade level standards on NYS Math tests increased from 49% in 2015  to 61% in 2016, and stayed at 61% in 2017    ● According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide., Inclusive Leadership was rated 97%, which exceeds the target by  2% for district and 3% for the city.   ● According to the Danielson Framework , for the fiscal school year 2017, 85% of teachers are Effective in component  3b (Using questioning and discussion techniques)   Needs:   Over the course of the past year,  we have come to realize that active engagement refers to the joint functioning of  motivation, conceptual knowledge, cognitive strategies, and social interactions in all academic activities. Providing  rigorous instruction alone is not sufficient for achieving high levels of student engagement. Students who are engaged  in their work are driven by four essential goals, each of which satisfies a particular need:    Success (the need for mastery),       Curiosity (the need for understanding),    Originality (the need for self-expression),    Relationships (the need for involvement with others).   We will continue to push for more student engagement through effective questioning and inquiry by using the  Academic and Personal Behavior indicators, implementing Discourse Protocols across all grades and subject areas,  and using "PS 295 Updated Classroom Environment Checklist," a set of explicit expectations to foster a supportive  environment for classroom management. By using these tools and supports teachers will continue to shift from  teacher driven classrooms to student centered classrooms--a fixed mindset into a growth mindset.    According to the Danielson Framework, 76% of teachers are Effective in component 3C (Engaging Students in  Learning). We believe that component 3C and 3B are directly related and want to capitalize on 3B to raise the level of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      engagement in all classrooms. This can be accomplished through effective questioning and inquiry. It is still our goal  to bring inquiry to the forefront this year.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have designed and used discourse protocols for their classroom in all subject areas,  to foster an increase in independence and engagement which in turn will create a classroom environment that supports  the academic and personal behavior indicators as measured by artifacts shared with administration and observations of  discourse protocols clearly defined and in use in the classrooms.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strengths:    ● As quoted in Inside Schools.org “[PS 295] takes particular pride in its special education program which serves nearly  a quarter of the population.”    We continue the work we began in 2016 when we worked with an ASD Consultant to implement strategies for  behavior management to support all learners.      With the assistance from our Thrive NYC mental health consultant PS 295 continues to utilize her expertise to   assist staff with helping develop strategies and awareness of social/emotional concerns for all students.   Needs:    PS 295 believes that a classroom that runs smoothly and functions efficiently is essential to good instruction and high  levels of student engagement. Students need to develop coping skills, self-control and confidence to work through  challenges. According to the 2017 NYC School Survey, in the category of Social Emotional , 61% of teachers responded  that a lot or all of the adults at their school recognize disruptive behavior as social-emotional learning opportunities,  whereas 69% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults at their school teach students the skills they need to  regulate their behavior (i.e. by focusing their attention, controlling their emotions, or managing their thinking,  behavior, and feelings).   With this in mind, we need to educate all teachers to understand the importance of supporting all students' social-  emotional needs. By reflecting on student work and behaviors we have learned that a high number of students in our  school struggle with these challenges, resulting in a lack of independence, work quality and self-motivation. In 2018- 2019, 13 out of 15 classrooms will be ICT classes. This growing population of SWD students, as well as our increase in  children in temporary housing will need additional classroom and instructional support.

Strengths:    ● According to indicator 3.4- High Expectations- on our January, 2015 Quality Review, we are Well Developed. “School  leaders incorporate various trainings to systematically communicate high expectations consistently to the entire staff.  School staff communicates effectively the expectations that promotes a positive partnership with families and  engages them in supporting their progress... The communication of high expectations has resulted in a culture of  mutual accountability with staff. Feedback to families supports progress towards those expectations.”   ● Each week teachers have a 6th period designated for common planning and curriculum development. One 6th  period a month will be devoted to meeting with administration for updates and communications regarding  expectations and student progress.   ● Weekly PD planning, curriculum development, etc.   ● Teachers utilize yearlong curriculum maps to plan and implement instruction   ● Since 2001 we have been a TC systemic school   Use of Google Apps for Educators as a way to communicate and share resources   Student Performance Data:   In looking at the results of the NYSESLAT for the 2017-2018 school year, out of 50 students tested the students scored  as follows:               Level 1 - Entering 2  Level 2 - Emerging 4  Level 3 - Transitioning 8  Level 4 - Expanding 24  Level 5 - Commanding 12   Breaking these results down to our SWD subgroup of 20 students tested, the results are as follows            Level 1 - Entering 0  Level 2 - Emerging 2  Level 3 - Transitioning 4  Level 4 - Expanding 9   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26         Level 5 - Commanding 5   From the results of the NYSESLAT the following trend was noted that approximately 25 % of the students taking the  NYSESLAT were able to reach level 5 and have tested out.

Needs:    Despite our past success in this area, we realize we need to take a more consistent and deliberate approach to  common planning and professional development. The Professional Development committee will meet every 6 weeks  to discuss and determine planning and PD needs for the school, updating the PD/planning calendar at that time. Our  major focus during planning and instruction is student engagement. Compliance cannot be viewed as engagement.

Needs:    From the data collected from the NYC School Survey though there are clear expectations for meeting instructional  goals and high standards set for student learning; teachers' are not clear on how to implement what they have  learned during professional development. They are unclear of what is expected of them.    The questions that arise from this data is as follows:   1.  Do teachers' require more explicit guidelines for implementation?  2.  Do teachers' need more time to try what they have learned with planned time for discussion for what works,   what supports they need, what doesn't work?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32            In order to develop the academic and personal behaviors necessary for students to achieve a mindset that  supports higher standards, our teachers also need to be given the tools to grow their teaching practices to  fully engage all students and shift their mindset from teacher-driven to student-center learning--- a fixed  mindset into a growth mindset.

The expectation for  planning units of study is similar in that all units need to be aligned to the CCLS.   ●Students in Pre-Kindergarten spend time visiting Kindergarten classrooms in the spring to ease the transition.   ● Pre-Kindergarten portfolios are passed to Kindergarten teachers at the end of the school year so they can gain some  knowledge regarding the strengths and needs of the students. Kindergarten teachers also have an opportunity to  have formal conversations with Pre-Kindergarten teachers in regards to the students’ strengths and needs.      Pre-K Parents are invited to attend all school-wide activities and workshops.         There are 6 Open Houses during the school year for Pre K families to partake in a presentation about PS 295, as well  as tour the school and visit classrooms.         PR K students have access to the School Assessment Team, service providers, special education liaison and IEP  Teacher to help plan for students at risk for or presenting with special needs.      The Social Worker assigned to the PS 295 Pre K also assists the staff with implementing strategies for and referring  students for early intervention services if needed.      ● Parents are invited for a Kindergarten Orientation in June to get acquainted with the routines and expectations for  Kindergarten.       ● PTA Parent Liaison organizes a summer get together for families new to PS 295 before the start of school.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5,a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e     n/a     5b, 5c, 5d, 5e     n/a     5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   240,850     0   12,366.00     0   3,025,418.00   X     n/a     X     n/a     X              1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 295, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 295 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, (ESSA)/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 18th of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter, maintaining web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress, the use of social media to inform parents of classroom initiatives   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 295, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

We are also in the process of piloting free English classes for  adults at our school with a not for profit organization (FeLTNYC.com) which should commence  by OCT 2018 and run throughout the school year.      How Parents will be notified:  *All notifications are distributed in English and in the parent home language (Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese and Russian).      Parents will be notified of various workshops and activities in multiple ways:  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·    ** Should there be a need for translation/interpretation for low incidence languages, the school  usually uses proficient staff members for support with translation/interpretation or the DOE's  translation and interpretation unit for support.  Our largest population of ELL parents are Spanish  speakers.  Our PC and many staff are Spanish proficient. For the other low incidence languages,  we have staff members that support the school when needed for translation/interpretation.     The school keeps all ELL PD records in the ENL filing cabinet in RM 101.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?      The formative assessment tools used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs are:    Reading Assessment Profile  Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) Running Records  TCRWP Reading – Pre Unit Assessments  TCRWP Writing on Demand (Pre-Formative)  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Pearson - Words Their Way Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Imagine Learning Literacy Software Program for ELLs  CCLS aligned teacher created benchmark Pre-Unit Math assessments  Results of the Spring State Exams (ELA and MATH for grades 4 and 5).

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school leadership team structure, made up of the administration, academic coach and grade leaders work to support this  effort continuously by setting goals and monthly targets to ensure that these formative assessments are implemented.  Towards the end of the school year (early June), each grade team collaborates and builds a framework for the pacing calendars  for the upcoming school year and forms the units for the grade curriculum and assessments to be administered.      Reading Assessment Profile:  Completed during the month of September (ongoing for those new registrants/transfers) to identify early literacy behaviors  and skills such as letter/sound recognition, phonemic/phonological awareness, high frequency word recognition, vocabulary  knowledge (grade level concept vocabulary and in context), mechanics, etc.    TCWRP Running Records:  TCWRP reading level assessments are completed (five times per year) to identify and document the initial reading level and  ongoing progress throughout the school year.  Also, at this time the formative literacy behaviors and analyzing their learning  styles, comprehension strategies and structure application will drive instruction and support the formation of guided  reading/strategy groups.    Pre-Unit Reading Assessments:  Before the start of each unit of the TCWRP reading program, students are assessed formatively based on unit/genre area of  study.    TCRWP -  Writing on Demand:  Completed before the start of each writing unit of the TCWRP writing program to assess writing skills for different genres of  writing (narrative, opinion, argumentative, historical fiction, etc.    Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark:  Used as an additional formative assessment dependent on the specific need(s) of the ELL that requires a benchmark, pre- guided reading cycle assessment, at risk/RTI selected student, etc.    Pearson - Words Their Way Assessments:  Used periodically throughout the year as one of the formative assessments to drive instruction for building vocabulary, writing  mechanics (spelling) and overall academic word study    Imagine Learning Literacy Software Program for ELLs/ELL-SWDs:  Used as a Title III literacy supplemental software program for those ELLs participating in our afterschool Title III program. This  program commences with a formative assessments which creates the individual literacy activities based on the student’s  benchmark assessment results.  This program commences in the winter and ends in the spring but the students are able to  access this software at home during the school year.  The data is reviewed to drive instruction on a monthly basis or as needed  by classroom teacher.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Benchmark CCLS aligned pre-unit assessments:  At the beginning of each school year, there are teacher created, formative pre-unit assessments that are used to supplement  the main Math curriculum which is TERC Investigations (Main Math program) and the GO MATH supplemental math program.  Teachers also review the previous year’s data as a source of initial assessment profiles.    NYSITELL:  Administered throughout the year for newly eligible registrants who may be potential ELLs.  This assessment will provide initial  data to plan instruction and programming based on the results in all modalities (speaking, listening, reading and writing) and  to identify overall progression level in all areas of learning.    SPANISH LAB:  Administered throughout the year for those eligible ELLs whose home language is Spanish.    This assessment will provide further data regarding native language literacy skills (reading, writing and comprehension skills).    NYSESLAT:  Administered every Spring, the results of this assessment drives instruction and programming for the upcoming academic  school year based on the results of progression level and individual modalities.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       The following summative assessments are used to identify benchmarks, student academic progress and key areas of need:    TCRWP Running Records:  The 5th TCRWP Running Records’ cycle’s assessment (from the previous school year) is used to identity initial benchmarks in  reading comprehension and progress in reading levels as well as targeted reading strategies.  TC Running Records was also  used as the school’s MOSL assessment tool for the 2016-17 academic school year, and was administered as a benchmark,  summative assessment and ongoing assessment tool for student progress and one of the main school performance evaluation  tools.    TCRWP Reading – Post Unit Assessments & Writing on Demand Post Assessments  The TCRWP post-unit assessments and Writing on Demand post assessments are used to drive instruction for each unit of  study in reading and writing.  The post unit assessments provide a summative assessment and implications of instruction as  well as areas still in need of review and support.    Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark:  This assessment is used as one of our summative assessments especially for post guided reading cycles and to verify progress.    Pearson - Words Their Way Assessments:  This assessment is also used as a summative assessment tool, to identify areas of need and provides specific data on what  vocabulary development skills that need to be implemented.  This is a tool to assess writing mechanics such as spelling  developmental stages and to implement as a grouping and placement tool.    Imagine Learning Literacy Software Program:  This assessment is specifically tailored to students’ language needs and supports the progress and stage of overall language  development.  Since this is an ongoing assessment tool to identify areas of progress, there are stages of this program targeted  for summative assessment of each ELL equipped with this language learning tool    GO MATH Unit Assessments:  The Go Math end of unit assessments is used as a summative assessment tool.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      NYSESLAT:  This assessment is not only used to drive instruction as a formative tool but is also used as a summative assessment tool used  to identify progress in all areas of learning within the four modalities and is the main formal assessment that guides instruction  to support all ELLs from Entering-Commanding proficiency on the language and literacy continuum.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The following structures are in place to address interventions once the summative data has been collected:    Targeted small group or one to one support sessions with the classroom teacher(s)  Academic coach (C. Ellrodt) and IEP Teacher (J. Radigan)  provides additional integrated and/or small pull-out group support  sessions  Additional ENL service time especially for those students who are newcomers or significantly below grade level standards  provided by ENL teachers (S. Montoya and S. Oh)  Bilingual Parent Coordinator (S. Borrero) provides numerous opportunities to welcome and acculturate all new ELL students  and their families who require special support in all areas  Counseling sessions for those in need provided by the Guidance Counselor  (H. Stoelting)     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     PS 295 uses both informal and formal data to guide the instruction for our ELLs within the RTI framework.  Based on the main  data assessment tools selected for the school, the classroom teacher(s) documents the interventions implemented with the  results of the data.  Next, if the Tier 1 strategies are unsuccessful, the teacher consults with the RTI team for possible Tier 2  intervention strategies/methods.  Then, the RTI team will confer and the assigned lead for the case will observe the student in  various learning environments and will inform/contribute to the initial steps for the Tier 2 plan. These plans are scheduled for  6-8 week programming and upon completion, it is assessed and if a Tier 3 intervention is necessary with specialty instruction  and specialist.  The RTI team will adhere to the following protocol:    Determine whether ELLs are benefiting from the instructional program selected during the 6-8 week time frame of  intervention plan with teacher and/or other support staff  Consult with member(s) of the School Based Support Team (SBST) depending on specific case(s)  Build more effective instructional programs for students who are not benefiting from current tiered group  Compare and implement different forms of instruction based upon the learning style of the student and whether those  teaching strategies are effective  Design more effective, individualized instructional programs based on need    Increase educational opportunities for linguistically and culturally diverse populations  Flexible grouping protocols in place should intervention plans are not meeting the individual needs/goals of the student     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     The following outcome assessments data are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program (ENL Freestanding only):    NYSESLAT  ELA  MATH  TCRWP - Running Records    The comprehensive data results of the formal assessments listed are used for programming our ENL program in terms of  grouping, scheduling and instructional needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70        NYSITELL / NYSESLAT 2017 RESULTS- (statistics based on current ELL student population of 16% inclusive of Former ELLs that  are being serviced)  PROGRESSION LEVEL  DATA  ENTERING – 6%  Grade K = 0  Grade 1 - 2  Grade 2 - 0  Grade 3 - 1  Grade 4 – 0  Grade 5 - 1  EMERGING – 4.5%  Grade K = 0  Grade 1 - 2  Grade 2 - 0  Grade 3 - 0  Grade 4 – 1  Grade 5 - 0  TRANSITIONING – 7.5%  Grade K = 0  Grade 1 - 2  Grade 2 - 1  Grade 3 - 0  Grade 4 – 1  Grade 5 - 1  EXPANDING – 45%  Grade K - 2  Grade 1 - 6  Grade 2 - 6  Grade 3 - 5  Grade 4 – 11  Grade 5 - 7  COMMANDING/PROFICIENT per ELA (score 3 or higher)- 26%  Grade 1 - 2  Grade 2 - 2  Grade 3 - 2  Grade 4 – 6  Grade 5 - 5    CURRENT ELLs – (tested to higher progression level) / 28.5%  GRADE 1 = 6  GRADE 2 = 1  GRADE 3 = 0  GRADE 4 = 2  GRADE 5 = 5  FORMER ELLs – (tested CM or Proficient per ELA score 3 or 4) / based on 2017 NYSESLAT results = 32%  GRADE 1 = 1  GRADE 2 = 0  GRADE 3 = 1  GRADE 4 = 2   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         GRADE 5 = 3  Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT results, PS 295 has reached all AMAO targets with a 28.5% number of ELLs who have made gains  in at least one progression level and overall 32% of our ELLs made progress including those who have tested proficient.  At the  beginning of every school year, the members of the ENL department and administration examine NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and  STATE EXAM data to evaluate data for programming and not only informs but drives instruction for all ELL teachers.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the start of the academic school year, the ENL team works closely with the administration to ensure that the following  structures are in place, make adjustments to our ELL program, and follow up on necessary changes.  We disseminate findings  based on:    The results of the Spring NYSESLAT / ELA / MATH / TCRWP Running Record  Newly identified ELLs per results of the NYSITELL exam  The results of the SPANISH LAB exam (based on eligibility)  Applicable ATS ELL reports  Conferencing with current and previous grade/classroom teachers  Flexible grouping based on learning styles, socioemotional and special needs    The ENL team administers all NYSITELL and SPANISH LAB exams for those eligible students while compiling all data/findings to  create ELL programming.  All the data is reviewed and analyzed per grade (K - 5) and the number of eligible ELLs who require  language support services are identified.  Once all students are identified with their progression level and mandated minutes  of services, the ENL team begins to schedule the ELL programs for the year. All guidelines, procedures and protocol for this  work is supervised and reviewed by the Assistant Principal/ELL Coordinator (L. Pagano).         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     PS 295 implements a heterogeneous organizational model, with at least one ICT class on each grade. Our ENL  program is a Freestanding English as a New Language Program as per the CR Part 154 with a combination of  integrated and stand-alone ENL services. There are ENL students in every class at PS 295. At PS 295, our ELLs are  grouped heterogeneously for the most part in the general education classrooms for all grades (K to 5), but at times  there may be a need to group homogeneously for the ENL students specifically. In many cases, a student is grouped  by his individual language acquisition needs as an ELL. As an example, a Newcomer might participate in several ENL  classes per week with other ELLs from his class, as a block of students within a mix of progression levels.  In addition,  he/she may be serviced in several classes per week with a separate Newcomer's ENL group or one to one session, to  ensure that we are supporting the building of communicative competence, schema, social/academic vocabulary,  foundational skills, and language learning strategies.  These goals are to support acculturation within a multicultural  focused learning and social environment.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a    c.  DL program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      Our Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) Program services students whose progression levels range from Entering  (mostly Newcomers) all the way to Commanding levels where the instruction is provided in English. Depending on their  progression levels, student receives anywhere from 90 minutes to 360 minutes per week of ENL services.  All ENL services are  provided as either a stand-alone model (in groups no larger than 12) and/or integrated services in their classrooms from  certified pedagogues (TESOL certified), as per CR Part 154. Entering and Emerging progression level students receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction from certified ENL pedagogues and 450 minutes (225 min in Reader’s workshop and 225 min in  Writer’s workshop) of ELA instruction from their main classroom teachers, while Transitioning and Expanding progression level  students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction from certified pedagogues, and 450 minutes of ELA instruction from their  main classroom teachers. Commanding progression level students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction from certified  pedagogues in their main classroom. Entering level students receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL services and 180 of  integrated ENL services in their main classroom; Emerging level students receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL services, 180  minutes of integrated ENL services, and 90 additional minutes of ENL services of either standalone or integrated instruction;  Transitional students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services and an additional 90 minutes of either standalone or  integrated ENL services; Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL services from their certified pedagogues in  their main classroom; and Commanding level students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services in their main classroom.  Presently, there are no Transitional Bilingual programs or Dual Language programs at our school; therefore Native Language  instruction is not delivered.  However exceptions are made on an as needed basis, home language (Spanish, Chinese, and  Arabic) is used occasionally for additional support by ENL or ELA pedagogue and bilingual paraprofessionals to support English  language acquisition.    There are no instructional minutes delivered in a TBE or DL program model since the school currently has no program in either  model.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     The ENL instructional program for all grades (K-5) adheres to the grade level core content based on the curriculum for the  grade and Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS).  Currently, our school has implemented the Teacher’s College Reading  and Writing Project (TCRWP) curriculum for the main English Language Arts content area and TERC Investigations curriculum  for the main Math content area.  The ENL program services students using school’s curriculum framework (pacing calendar,  units of study, assessments, , etc.), but many of the learning tools, methods, materials, and strategies are aligned with ENL  best teaching practices, which are governed by CCLS.    ELLs’ home language(s) and culture(s) are regarded as assets and are used by ENL and content area teachers in bridging prior  knowledge to new knowledge, and in making content meaningful and comprehensible. Teachers use knowledge of the  students' native language structures and informally assess students' prior knowledge to inform instruction.  Our only program  model is Freestanding ENL. The main goal of our ENL program is to foster full English language proficiency in a supportive  classroom environment. Both the content area and ENL teachers who work with our ELLs in the ENL program are fully  certified. In order to support students’ progress, we utilize the following practices:    Collaborative planning between ENL and content area teachers for units of study including implementation of Common Core  curriculum     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      Scaffolding as an essential part of the instructional delivery of content areas, such as modeling, bridging (text to self- connections), schema building, contextualization, text representation and meta-cognition.    Assisting Newcomers or those who require interventions with additional service sessions during professional per periods or  rescheduled periods    Scheduling conferences with students in and out of class, informal/formal assessments such as TCWRP Running Records,  Words Their Way, Post unit assessments, etc.    Additional small group/RTI intervention sessions for those students not meeting grade standards across content areas to focus  on literacy and academic language development using the Wilson Fundations literacy program and Flying Start to Literacy  program    Supplemental Title III program (based on approved funding) to support ELLs with the focus of fostering English language  development and acquiring more academic language using the Imagine Learning literacy software program for ELLs    NYSESLAT test prep workbooks (Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT), teacher made materials/assessments and various ENL  focused activities.    Beyond explicit ENL instruction, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for all of the language  needs of our ELLs. Some aspects and goals of this policy include: a.  Both ENL and content area teachers are monitoring the  understanding of linguistically challenging material, domain-specific vocabulary, and CCLS, by using a variety of teaching  strategies and multiple entries to clarify meaning (visuals, interactive games and activities, song, videos, field trips , etc.) b.  Math teachers (in collaboration with ENL teachers) devote extra class time to provide various strategies to help dissect  challenging word problems, focus on developing domain-specific/academic content based vocabulary, present real-life  problems in various ways to ensure comprehensible input with the use of multiple learning tools and manipulatives. There is a  focus to clarify misconceptions using the constructivist approach. c. social studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual  aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase comprehension.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     PS 295 offers an ENL program where the instruction is in English only. The school uses the SPANISH LAB (for those ELLs who  have Spanish as a home language only) to evaluate the home language literacy skills initially for those applicable. This formal  assessment of Spanish literacy skills is administered within the first 10 days of school entrance by one of our ENL teachers, S.  Montoya, with support at times from Spanish bilingual paraprofessional M. Pineda.  Besides the SPANISH LAB, the school does  not evaluate ELLs in their home language throughout the year. Currently we do not have a TBE or a Dual Language program.  Should there be a need to evaluate home language other than Spanish for an ELL, the ELL's initial evaluation of native language  skills is done through a formal interview by the ENL teachers, S. Montoya or S. Oh, with parent(s) along with other staff  members fluent in those languages (as available on-site such as M. Pineda in Spanish, S. Dian in Chinese, V. Bittner in Russian  and M. Boshro in Arabic), as well as support from school leadership and the support of several DOE offices such as the  Translation and Interpretation Unit. Formal evaluation of English language proficiency is provided by the ENL teacher using the  NYSITELL for Newcomers within the first 10 days of their entrance to school and the NYSESLAT for continuing ENL students.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results:    There are a total of 50 (not including 17 former ELLs) ENL students. The breakdown is as follows: 0 - SIFE, 43 - Newcomers, 7 -  ELLs in years 4-6, N/A - Long Term ELLs. Out of these numbers, 19 (25 including former ELLs) are Special Education ELLs.      a.            SIFE    Although we currently do not have any SIFE students on register, we have the following instructional procedures and plan in  place for any identified ELLs in the near future:    These students will be provided the full range of academic based intervention services once an initial individualized needs  assessment is completed based on the DOE’s SIFE identification tool framework. There would be an academic intervention  plan with a focus on literacy and math content.  Based on the framework and assessment tools to verify current levels in the  main content areas, SIFE students would be offered the following intervention/instructional plans outside of their ENL  instructional time:    Differentiated instruction and support will be implemented during intensive-small group instructional time, especially with  support from bilingual paraprofessional  Mentoring sessions (scheduled as necessary)  Lunchtime clubs  After school tutoring and clubs  Additional language acquisition opportunities using the technological support of the Imagine Learning ELL literacy software  program on the computer and Books-on- CDs for audible support for leveled books  Flying Start to Literacy Intervention book series for guided reading comprehension and academic vocabulary development  iPads and laptops are used throughout the school day for all content area classes to provide access to language learning  tools/materials and provide visual support    b. Newcomer    When a new student has been identified as an ELL as well as being new to the country and US school system, we provide the  following resources to facilitate the transition and acculturation to the school culture and environment:    Offer informal student orientation, with translation if necessary, and implement a needs assessment plan for instruction once  all formal assessments are completed    Differentiate instruction by implementing the Total Physical Response (TPR) approach, varied role-playing, nonverbal learning  cues, language frames in writing, offering the use of bilingual glossaries/picture dictionaries for all content areas, creating and  implementing use of thinking maps/visual organizers, charts, intense guided reading and thematic content vocabulary  development materials/tools, technology based instruction, additional small group and one on one ENL sessions as necessary    Scheduling of peer models and bilingual paraprofessionals partnering are scheduled during the week    c. Developing    Once ELL student data is assessed, instruction is differentiated in various ways for developing ELLs such as  heterogeneous/homogeneous grouping, differentiated thinking maps/organizers (varies by  project/lesson/activity/metacognitive skills), access to technology based support programs such as Imagine Learning literacy  software program, collaborative peer project leads and mentoring sessions. Since they are provided with a combination of  stand-alone and/or integrated ENL services to support their work in the content areas, the ENL teachers collaborate with the  content area teachers to differentiate instruction such as: developing academic vocabulary within context in all four language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      modalities and in alignment with the CCLS; provide small group explicit instruction in word study within context such as prefix  and suffix work to help decipher longer, complex vocabulary; support in dissecting complex texts for reading comprehension;  development of figurative language such as idioms;  provide explicit instruction of the writer’s process in all writing genres.    d. Long Term    Our ELLs are examined closely at the start of the year.  Our research indicates that our long term ELLs are having the most  difficulty with the reading and writing modalities on the NYSESLAT exam and in the ELA content area.  There will be an initial  needs assessment that will provide specific instructional plans for those ELLs who require targeted SMART goals for each  marking period.  The instruction for these long term ELLs are differentiated with a myriad of explicit teaching strategies with a  focus of fostering academic vocabulary development such as content based thinking maps/organizers, word study logs, explicit  teaching model, community based learning approach , etc. Content area and ENL teachers meet weekly to ensure students’  language acquisition and content area goals are being supported. These ELLs receive targeted individual reading  comprehension development sessions with the Flying Start to Literacy program and the Imagine Learning literacy software  program which provides data to drive instruction and support the skills in learning modalities requiring the most support.      e. ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Students who have achieved a Commanding progression level score on the Spring 2016 and 2017 NYSESLAT exams will  continue to receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week for two years.  They will continue to receive  differentiated instruction (per individual needs) and will be entitled to ELL testing modifications on all New York State  assessments for up to two years.  They will continue to participate in all ELL targeted academic intervention, RTI-based and  intensive small group enrichment activities if needed.  The instruction is 100% integrated in a collaborative learning  model.  Students are invited to participate in all after school and Title III programs.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     The instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use that provide access to academic content  areas and accelerate English language development are the following (38% of our ELL population are Students with Special  Needs with IEPs):       Instructional strategies and grade-level materials:    Flexible grouping (small group instruction) / cooperative learning models  TPR and Community Language Learning Approach  Collaborative teaching between all service providers and ENL teacher  IEP goals and recommendations provide overarching instructional guidelines for individualized needs (assigned bilingual  paraprofessional where eligible)  Wilson Language Fundations Intervention program  Various appropriate technologies, Smartboard and iPad-based programs such as TV Teacher, Me Moves, Brain Pop, Go Noodle,  teachertube.com based instructional lessons, Imagine Learning literacy program, Go Math, Khan academy and Applications  such as Hearbuilder/Super Duper “WH” Questions/Story Builder, etc.  Scaffolding/modeling strategies/bridging/contextualizing  Use of manipulatives and other tactile learning materials  Flying Start to Literacy Program       7.

Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For PS 295 - We currently have an ENL program in place (No TBE or Dual Language program at present).  We follow numerous  targeted intervention programs for ELLs in all applicable content areas once a needs assessment such as the Flying Start to  Literacy program, Imagine Learning literacy software program for ELLs, Words Their Way program, etc., is completed.  All  activities and supports offered to our ELL population are focused on their acquisition of language proficiency and academic  progress.

How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students at PS 295 have equal access to all school programs regardless of designation status and/or classification.  All ELLs  are afforded equal access to all regular scheduled “specials” within school programming such as visual arts, drama, seeds of  kindness, creative movement and supplemental services (if applicable) throughout the school year and are welcome to  participate based on availability. ELL parents are encouraged to join the Parent Association (PA) and provided opportunities to  participate/volunteer in all PA and school sponsored events.  Some of the terms for supplemental programs and activities are  dependent on yearly funding (programs subject to change).  PS 295 offers the following after school and supplemental services  throughout the year:    Cultural After School Adventure (CASA) program (available per funding) provides opportunity for all students to participate in  music, digital media, dance/movement, song writing/composition and visual art related workshops after school (grades 2 to 4 /  duration 14 weeks)    African Dance/Drumming program (grade 3/ duration 18 weeks - 100 minutes per week) funded by the Matisse Foundation,  provides opportunities for students to participate and learn about various African dance styles and rhythmic movements.  African Drumming sessions provides opportunities for students to participate and learn African drumming which aligns with  the grade’s African study unit and have more access to a multicultural education    Wellness In The Schools (WITS) program (entire school) - all year term that provides opportunities for students to participate  and learn about wellness/health, nutrition and cooking skills, science etc.    Fit Bit program (entire school) - all year term that fosters movement breaks in the classroom throughout the day to stimulate  higher academic processing that are supported through smart board programs which is in addition to the enhanced organized  play time during recess    Align Brooklyn (grade 2 only / once a month) - fitness partner with our school focusing on health practices, mainly Yoga with  some Pilates and some meditation.

The school has a  Language Access Coordinator (LAC - S. Borrero) who ensures that all Translation and Interpretation Services are in place so that  access to any language is made available to those families who may require these services. Additionally, interpretation services  are made available on a daily basis with the support of in-house interpreters who aid the communication between school staff  and parents.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80           Besides the instructional materials that are used based on the school’s academic curriculum; TCWRP curriculum and unit study  guides/text (all grades K-5),TERC Investigations and GO Math curriculum guides/text, the following supplemental instructional  materials and technology tools are used to support ELLs in the core content areas and language acquisition needs:    Flying Start to Literacy Program  Imagine Learning Literacy software program for ELLs and ELL-SWDs  Wilson Fundations Literacy Program (Grades K -2)  Words Their Way Program  Word Study Games:  Flash cards/ Phonics games/ Bingo/ Vocabulary Match, etc.  Audio usage (books and poems) on CD/DVD - listening centers  Smart Board access for various ELL related learning sites  iPad access for ELL-SWDs during Speech and OT sessions as well as during independent study time and/or reading for ELLs  Getting Ready For The NYSESLAT program to support Title III programs  Ready New York CCLS English Language Arts Practice  Access to bilingual glossaries and picture dictionaries/traditional dictionaries in all classrooms       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?       Currently, PS 295 does not have a TBE or Dual Language Program.  We offer a Free-standing ENL program where the  instruction is provided 100% in English. Home language/literacy assessment is usually completed for newly identified ELLs who  have a home language of Spanish using the SPANISH LAB.  Other than that assessment, we have access to the Translation and  Interpretation Unit should there be a needs assessment required in the home language.  Occasionally (as needed especially  with newcomers arriving from other countries for the first time), support is provided in native languages by the ENL  pedagogues, classroom teachers, or bilingual paraprofessionals, when and where appropriate, in accordance with the CR Part  154 regulations. In addition, our diverse staff members support many native languages, including: Spanish, Portuguese,  Chinese, Arabic, Russian and French. Word-to-word glossaries and bilingual glossaries are available as well as access to  technology-based language learning tools such as google.translate for added support, for those students with native language  literacy in the content areas.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      PS 295 has a comprehensive IEP team of specialists, ENL department team and Academic Coach who work closely to ensure  that all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ age and grade levels.  At initial registration, all students  are assigned classes according to birthdate and corresponding appropriate grade level.  We also take into consideration the  grade level completed in the home country (upon verification of documents when available), any IEP designations for those  ELL-SWDs.  Many ELL-SWDs are also considered for many of the ICT classes on the grades since the trends show more schools  are following ICT teaching models as we are following suit.  Small group include Fundations phonics and Wilson reading  programs for those ELL students presenting these difficulties. Classroom scaffolding and differentiation of instruction for ELLs  is planned cooperatively with ENL teachers and content area teachers across the grades.    Each student’s mandated services per IEP and assessed language progression level is examined and scheduled collaboratively  with all service providers (S. Campbell/ OT, L. Goeringer/ OT, Bernard Pamilar/ PT, J. Wood/ Speech, V. Botin/ Speech,  J. Radigan/IEP Teacher, H. Stoelting/Guidance Counselor) to ensure there are no major conflicts in scheduling so that all  services are received.  All ELLs are provided homogeneous stand-alone and/or heterogeneous integrated ENL sessions per  progression level mandates and support services as per IEP classification(s) and recommendations in the least-restrictive  learning environment.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81        PS 295 shares a building (collocation) with MS 443 (New Voices School of Academic and Creative Arts). MS 443 is a middle  school for grades 6, 7 and 8; therefore we do not collaborate or have a shared ENL program with the school.  We are separate  schools and only co-locate.    Since our school co-locates with MS 443, we ensure that all students in both schools have access to shared spaces such as the  auditorium/cafeteria/physical education space/outdoor black top areas/directionality in hallways and usage of the main office.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     For newly enrolled ELLs that are registered and identified before the beginning of the school year, families are provided the  opportunity to schedule a school tour and informal orientation with the Parent Coordinator (S.Borrero), IEP Teacher (J.  Radigan), ENL Teachers (S. Montoya and S. Oh) and ELL Coordinator/AP (L. Pagano) where translation is available in the home  language either by an interpreter in-house or via the DOE Translation and Interpretation Services Unit.  In addition, yearly  Kindergarten orientation for the incoming Kindergarten class is presented by the school’s administration team and  Kindergarten teachers.  These tours/orientations are offered to familiarize themselves with the school’s curriculum, space,  programs, departments and culture and are scheduled on an ongoing basis throughout the school year (outside of the  mandated ELL Parent Orientation for newly identified ELLs). During this time, we can organize Q & A sessions and/or necessary  events depending on need and the number of newly enrolled ELL population or potential newly identified ELL population in  the fall.    Prior to the beginning of the school year, families of newly enrolled ELLs have access to our school’s website (includes  introduction to school’s mission/goals, staff and ongoing events), which is also available in Spanish.  For other languages, PS  295 will offer translation services from the DOE T&I Unit. A plethora of school/DOE-related literature and materials are  provided, such as the Parent Handbook, “The Bulletin” (school based newsletter), Achieve NYC (guide to NYC public schools),  and DOE discipline code manuals, families are informed and encouraged to join the PA and provided information about all  after school program/activities, school clubs, unofficial soccer league for inclusion and participation in the PS 295  community.  After school enrichment and Title III literacy programs are available and encouraged especially for the ELL  population.  All programs and events scheduled at the school are made available to new ELLs who are registered throughout  the school year.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?      N/A    Currently, PS 295 does not offer foreign language electives at this time.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A   Currently, PS 295 does not offer a Dual Language program at this time.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    PS 295 provides (off-site PDs included) professional development to all staff including Assistant Principal, Guidance Counselor,  ENL teachers, Special Education Teachers, Academic Coach, Occupational and Physical therapists, Speech Therapists, School  Psychologist, Paraprofessionals, Secretaries, and the Parent Coordinator that specifically addresses the needs of the ELLs in the  building.  At the beginning of each school year, there is a professional development calendar template that is created by  School Leadership which provides a framework for the planned workshop sessions for the staff that is shared with all  personnel. This is a working document that is amended throughout the school year.  Professional development sessions are  also noted in the Newslink which is a newsletter/events notice which goes out to all staff.    A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by pedagogical  mandate is dedicated to support language acquisition instruction, including strategies of best practices for collaborative team  teaching strategies and integrating language learning and content area instruction for all ELLs. For all ENL teachers, a minimum  of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours is dedicated to language acquisition instruction and is in  alignment with core content area instruction, targeting best practices for collaborative team teaching strategies and  integrating language and content area instruction for ELLs.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     PS 295 schedules annual individual meetings with the parents or guardians of ELLs at least once a year which is separate to the  yearly parent-teacher conferences, initial ELL parent orientation meetings, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled  meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals our ENL program, their child’s language development  progress, English language proficiency assessment results including NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT exams where applicable, and  language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting includes school staff necessary to sufficiently inform  the parents or guardians about their child’s language development in all content areas in English. The parent meetings are  conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent/guardian’s home  language.  Our school schedules many of these meetings during the Tuesday parent engagement times (2:40 pm - 3:20 pm), in  accordance with the collective bargaining agreements. We record attendance by using a parent sign-in template that the ENL  department has created which documents date, student name, parent name, teacher name(s), contact info and signatures.    The agenda for the parent engagement meetings are planned to cover the following areas of concern:    Role of the ENL Teacher  ENL vs. ESL - What are the differences?  NYSITELL vs. LAB-R - What are the changes in ELL identification testing?  SPANISH LAB (for those eligible students only)  Yearly mandated state exams (NYSESLAT/ELA/MATH/SCIENCE (grade 4)  Language development goals and progress (progression levels)  Data and assessment results  Review of DOE language support programs (where applicable)  Goals/mission (aligned to the school’s mission) of the school’s ENL program  Language acquisition needs and supports in all content areas  Reading/Writing and Math CCLS      ONE to One Meetings:  ENL teacher schedules one to one meetings with their grade teacher (both teachers if ICT classroom) throughout the year to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          89         discuss English proficiency,  language acquisition progress, areas of support, specific needs within the student’s progression  level – modality specific if necessary, data/assessment results and conference exchanges.  These meetings are usually  scheduled 3-5 times a year and many before parent-teacher conferences or parent engagement meetings.  Meetings for TURN-KEY of information to teachers or PD offerings from ENL teacher to Classroom teacher(s):  At least once a month, ENL teacher will join grade meetings or other student specific meeting where there will be an  opportunity to provide training of ELL specific teaching strategies and/or turn-key information acquired at off-site PD sessions.  PROTOCOL of scheduling meetings:  Scheduling of meetings are made throughout the year, and are requested via email or verbally and all required  teacher/specialists are invited to attend.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.           PS 295 recognizes that parents are the first and best teachers of their children. Research shows that students who have  involved parents perform better and achieve more academically.  We work closely with the Community-Based Organizations  (CBOs) to provide our parents with education classes, health programs and other services (needs assessments are conducted  yearly and ongoing).  All parents are encouraged to attend and participate in all school and parent specific events and  activities/workshops that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs so that may better support their child’s learning.  We  also have a Parent Association that promotes diverse membership and community service.    The following school and parent specific events and activities/workshops are offered at PS 295 throughout the school year:    Events to be planned  Bagel Bits monthly event - parents are invited every month during period 1 (8:30am - 9:10 am) to observe and engage in their  child’s class  PA organized events such as Cupcake Friday, Touch-a-Truck annual event, Dance-a-thon event, Brooklyn Boogie Brunch etc.  Opportunities to participate and volunteer in community celebrations such as Publishing Parties, Field Day, Annual Spring Arts  Festival,  Harvest Festival, Seasonal school plays and concerts and the Cultural Dance Festival.  Informational events for those needing support with continuing education classes, health care/wellness, social service needs  and English language learning  Opportunities to join School Leadership (SLT),  Executive Committee (EC) as well as to become a member of the PA    Planned Activities/Workshops    How to engage your child in conversation that promotes critical thinking through talking prompts and critical questioning  techniques?  How to better understand your child’s math CCLS and homework?  How to use technology to support your child’s learning?  The importance of reading (English and home language) and what it means to be a good reader?    These events and activities/workshops will provide access and encourage parent involvement/participation at our school in all  ways. The school community and all families come together during these times to recognize student achievements. All parents  are invited and informed about school happenings and all information/flyers/letters are distributed in English, Spanish, Arabic,  Russian and Chinese (which are the main home languages represented at our school).

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Linda Mazza, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 295                                                                              School DBN: 15K295  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When a student is registered at the school, the parents complete a HLIS form. Part III of this form inquires as to  what language the parent prefers for his/her oral and written communications with the school. At the beginning  of each academic year a Parent Survey and the DOE contact cards are distributed to every student's home  inquiring about preferred oral and written languages for their communication. In addition the contact card is  available to be completed online in both English and Spanish via the school website. These multiple sources of  information provide us with the identification of the preferred communication of both oral interpretation and  written documentation. Of the 495 students this year, parents speaking Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian  requested oral interpretation and translation of written documents.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94         Language    Spanish    Chinese   Arabic   Russian                       Written Preferred    Oral Preferred    Percent Written                            Percent Oral                3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will be implementing a parent survey that will be distributed several times over the course of the school year. This  survey will be distributed after the November parent teacher conferences, the January promotion in doubt meeting  and the final distribution will occur after the March parent teacher conferences. The outreach for these surveys will  be to the entire parent population. In addition, a separate survey will be distributed to any parent whose child  receives special education services. Upon receipt of each of these surveys, the feedback will be analyzed and help the  school implement additional supports so that we can continue to improve the quality and availability of services.   In addition, we are scheduling a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our  school to help us gather feedback.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          98
