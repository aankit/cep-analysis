This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 188Q Mission Statement: At Public School 188Q, our mission is to create a school community with staff, parents,  and students actively working together in decision making. Additionally, students are empowered to have input on  ideas to improve the school and help the outside community. Our varied energies are dedicated and focused on  educating a well-rounded child. By providing standards-driven instruction within a nurturing environment, as well as  developing civic and social skills, we are creating a community of life-long learners.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Gifted and Talented – There are two GT classes in each grade (K-5) in the 2018-2019 school year. The specific needs  for GT students include motivating and enriching learning experiences and challenges from their teachers and peers.   Self-Contained Special Education – There is one 12:1:1 special education class in the 2018-2019 school year. There is a  grade 2, 3, 4 bridge class . The specific needs for 12:1:1 students include targeted instruction to maximize student  progress in critical thinking within an environment where students feel safe and supported. This population also  benefits from instruction in social skills and social interactions.   ICT Special Education – There is one ICT class in each grades (K-5) for the 2018-2019 school year. The specific needs  for ICT students include rigorous instruction with active student engagement that is aligned to CCLS.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year, P.S. 188Q made the most progress in Collaborative Teachers and Creating Strong  Family Community Ties.   Collaborative Teachers     P.S. 188Q teacher teams promoted the implementation of the CCLS and the instructional shifts and used data  within teacher teams to improve instruction. Administrators and teachers structured teacher team meetings  to ensure that they were effective and productive. For example, the Assistant Principal ensured that teacher  team training included skills, strategies, and resources they needed to make their meetings highly effective  including the assignments of team leaders and protocols for looking at student work. Professional learning  was conducted within a culture of respect. Administrators held teachers accountable for the implementation  of team decisions regarding next steps. For example, administrators and IT leaders helped teams take  ownership for using data and student work and to use this data for continuous refinement of teaching. At P.S.  188Q, all inquiry teams were centered on the school’s instructional focus and CEP goals. In addition, teachers  were encouraged and provided support so they could lead their own professional learning groups. Through  rotating cycles, teacher-leaders conducted professional learning on writing, Fundations, social studies, social- emotional learning, and science. The staff were encouraging to the teacher-leaders and helped to make each  session run smoothly and productively.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Creating Strong Family-Community Ties     P.S. 188Q’s administrators and teachers establishing strong partnerships with families to support students’  progress towards college and career readiness. P.S. 188Q kept families informed of their children’s progress  towards those expectations. For example, teachers regularly engaged students and families in discussions  regarding student progress and improvement plans including parent meetings, emails, class Dojos, and phone  calls home. Teachers provided ongoing information from a variety of sources for students and families such as  diagnostic information from pre-tests, TC assessment letters, and results of classroom tests. P.S. 188Q  teachers made families feel welcome and respected by inviting them to partake in schools activities such as:  celebrations, concerts, Field Day, field trips, read-alouds, and parent run workshops. P.S. 188Q also hosted  monthly Wonderful Days for parents to visit their child's classroom and see instruction taking place. P.S. 188Q  responded to parent concerns immediately, and encouraged parents to actively get involved in the school.  P.S. 188Q was able to keep families engaged in the school and to be open to specific conversations about  their children’s progress. Teacher informed parents of periodic learning expectations and specific ways  parents could support their children’s learning through class newsletters and email updates.      The key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year are RIGOROUS INSTRUCTION and creating A supportive  environment.       Rigorous Instruction     P.S. 188Q will help students understand complex math problems and persevere in order to solve them.    P.S. 188Q will expand teachers' skills in creating rigorous math tasks. These tasks may include: More than one   way to solve or approach; Cognitive challenges; Real world applications and inter-disciplinary whenever  possible; the need to organize information before solving; problems may have multiple solutions and may  allow multiple representations.     P.S. 188Q will expand teachers' skills in creating opportunities for deep math discourse. Teachers will craft   questions and prompts that support development of conceptual understanding (e.g. help students compare  and contrast ideas and/or representations) and to use appropriate math vocabulary to explain their problem  solving steps. Teachers will improve their skills to create sentence frames and other tools that allow for richer  student discourse about conceptual understanding. This may include creating discussion prompts; modeling  discourse through think-alouds; crafting cross-curricular questions such as, "Why did you choose that  strategy? Is there another strategy that you could have used? What evidence supports your claim of ____?  Looking at ___, does this prove ____? What is the relationship between __ and __? What do you notice about  ____? What happened when ___?"   Creating a Supportive Environment     P.S. 188Q’s will enhance their English Language Arts (ELA) instruction and teaching practices by promoting all   five competencies of the CASEL social and emotional learning (SEL) components. Students will be given the  chance to develop core social and emotional competencies of self-awareness, self-management, social  awareness, responsible decision-making, and relationship skills. This alignment will increase academic  achievement, improve attitudes and behaviors, decrease negative behaviors, and reduce emotional distress.  The core SEL competencies will help student to develop stronger ELA skills and to become college and career  ready.  Students will see the connections between current tasks and their personal goals and interests; reflect on  their personal aspirations, goals, and objectives in writing assignments (self-awareness).  Students will develop skills for focusing attention, managing stress and anxiety, and accomplishing goals in  order to effectively participate in classroom learning (self-management).         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13                     Students will develop empathy and perspective-taking in their thinking, reading, and writing processes (social- awareness).  Students will develop speaking and listening skills for presentations and learn to collaborate in groups where  they are encouraged to consider the perspectives and thought processes of their peers (relationship skills).  Students will use writing to reflect on choices and goals as a way of developing strong decision-making skills  (responsible decision-making).         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q188   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   734   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        School's Strengths Relative to the Framework     Making strategic organizational decisions to support the school’s instructional goals and meet student   learning needs.    o  Schedules have been crafted to allow teams of teachers to meet on a regular basis to grow   professionally and to focus work on the school’s instructional goals.    o  Times have been set aside that allow teachers to strategically, plan, share, and engage in learning that   will help to improve instruction resulting in the creation of challenging academic tasks.    o  Teacher assignments have been strategically selected anchored to a criteria of effective practices and   supported via outside coaching in order to deepen capacity of teacher development.  In most classrooms, teachers provide aligned checklists and rubrics to students for self-assessment  and clear expectations.  In most classrooms, teachers integrate DOK into their questioning practices.   o   o      Priority Needs      In most classrooms, teachers provide students with the same activity/materials/tasks without scaffolds.  Therefore, teachers must make improved activities/materials/tasks to provide entry points or all learners.     Teachers will include reflection time for students to cement understanding during all lessons.      2017-2018 School Quality Guide      o  66% of teachers say that students have to work hard to do well.  o  62% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions.  o  64% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions in class.  o  67% of teachers say that students build on each other’s ideas during class discussions.  o  73% of teachers say that students use data or text references to support their ideas.  o  63% of teachers say that students provide constructive feedback to their peers and teachers.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16         NYS Math & ELA Tests – compared 2016, 2017, and 2018 scores –    According to the New York School Report Card 2016-2017 , AYP in both ELA and Math was not met due to not  meeting the 95% participation rate.   2016 - 2018 ELA - Drop in lgrades 3 & 5 level 4 students.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      School's Strengths Relative to the Framework     Engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared   leadership and focuses on improved student learning.   o  The vast majority of teachers are engaged in professional learning and collaborations in order to   strengthen teacher instructional capacity.    o  Leadership structures are embedded to allow teachers to work in different roles to help lead this   work in improving student outcomes and pedagogical practices.    o  The central team consist of a teacher member from each grade level and subject area that meet   regularly with school leaders to study an identified area of growth and to take this learning to share  and train the grade level teams.    o  Grade level teams meet weekly to focus on a targeted group of students reflecting on the work from   that of the central team.    o  A vertical team also exists that is anchored to staffing assignments (gifted and talented, cluster   teachers, special education personnel, STEAM).    o  This design allows for teachers to collaborate within their specialization in hopes of deepening their   understanding and learning of practices, curriculum, and coherence.    o  When teachers attend outside professional learning, teachers share their learnings with their   colleagues during professional learning time.   o  During teacher meeting times, teachers work on developing aligned rubrics and checklists.  o  Teachers are working under a coherent set of beliefs as outlined by school-wide expectations.  o  The practices employed by teachers are reflected and anchored to the Danielson Framework for   Teacher.   Priority Needs     Using protocols during teacher team time, teachers will improve their practice of analyzing student work to   inform instructional choices.     Weekly, teachers will meet to engage in team professional learning experiences aligned to the school's   instructional focus of "At P.S. 188Q, teachers will differentiate and scaffold learning so that students will be  able to make sense of rigorous tasks and persevere in solving them."           o  o  2017-2018 School Quality Guide   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45           68% of teachers say that teachers are eager to try new ideas.    60% of teachers say that they had the opportunity to work productively with teachers from   other schools on professional development.     54% of teachers say that they have influence over the selection of instructional materials   used in classrooms.     55% of teachers say that they have influence over planning how discretionary funds should   be used.     72% of teachers say that they have influence over hiring new professional personnel.   o  ADVANCE – Rating Distribution by Domain/Component – D4 (Professional Responsibilities), 4e   (Growing and developing professionally)     0% Ineffective    0% Developing    56% Effective    44% Highly Effective         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

N/A        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          89     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 188Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 188Q will support parents and families by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s programs. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parents, parent members of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as  well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent Involvement Policy.  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  programs as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the  school’s Parent Involvement Policy;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding which are set aside to promote parent involvement,   including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as      described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and  the Parent-Teacher Association. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;      maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator  will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school  and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent  Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report  with the central office;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.               The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement     hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year; encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, and Parent-Teacher  Association;supporting and hosting Family evening events;     establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92     developing and distributing a school newsletter, school webpage, and Twitter feed designed to keep parents   informed about school activities and student progress;     providing regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the extent   practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) benchmarking to assess the early literacy skills of our  students.  We also use the TCRWP to level our students to find out their reading level.  We use the information to determine  how much vocabulary an English Language Learner (ELL) knows, how well an ELL can spell grade-appropriate words, how well  the ELL can comprehend a story with a retell, and his or her ability to follow directions. These assessments provide valuable  insights for the teachers as they plan lessons.  In grades K-2, teachers also assess students on sight words and letter/sound  recognition.  After being a TCRWP school in the past with the data to prove it's worth, we have returned to using TCRWP for  our writing.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At this time, we have one teacher attending TCRWP workshops on each grade and hope for more in the future, depending on  budgeting.  Teachers are provided extra preps to assess their students using TCRWP benchmarking whenever possible.  In our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          97      Kindergarten classrooms, the children are provided with an extra period with the Dance cluster teacher each week, allowing  the teachers to pull students for assessments and mini lessons in these areas.  In addition, we update our  assessment materials whenever the system puts out an updated version.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our schools uses many baseline, formative and summative assessments throughout the year in order to identify students'  present levels of performance and continually assess student progress and areas of need including the following: TC Running  Records for Reading, Writing On-Demand, Beginning of Year Math Inventory, Math pre and post assessments,  Chapter tests  and Math Exemplars,  National Geographic Reach Unit Tests for English Language Learners.  In addition, we look at student test results from periodic assessments across the year.  Classroom tests and reading  assessments are used to evaluate student progress.  We use Teacher's College (TC) to assess student reading levels every six to  eight weeks.  The goal is for all of our ELLs to learn and improve their English language skills in all four modalities (reading,  writing, listening, and speaking) throughout the school year.       Our ELLs have specific areas of need in both reading and writing as seen by our multiple assessments and data, including data  from the English Language Learner Data Analysis Tool (EDAT).  We are working to increase student fluency and comprehension  in English to better improve their ability to read and write across all subject areas.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data is gathered, our school's Inquiry teams meet to review the data during professional development  time on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Our teachers and administrators assess the data carefully, looking for trends across grades,  across populations, and across content areas.  Depending on our findings, we will carefully decide upon possible changes to  our practice in order to best support our student's academic success.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers use Teacher's College reading assessments and classroom assessments to determine if a child may need Response to  Intervention (RTI) help in September.  We also hold inquiry meetings in September to examine the New York State English  Language Arts and Math exam data to determine which children may be struggling in an academic area and provide RTI  support for students scoring at a level 2 or below.  Tier 1 interventions take place in the classroom, including strategies such  as shared reading, small group work, word work, and close reading of a text help scaffold learning for these select  students.  The RTI team reviews the students and their data on a monthly basis.    After a six-week trial of Tier 1 interventions a student may still be struggling.  In this case, teachers will complete a Pupil  Personnel Team (PPT) form in order to have the student included in the next team meeting.  At this meeting, the PPT will  review the data on the given student and determine what Tier 2 interventions will be able to take place such as Fundations in  the lower grades and Wilson Reading System in the upper grades.  These interventions may take place in or out of the  classroom and will be implemented alongside the Tier 1 interventions.  They may also occur with multiple pedagogues, such as  the ENL teacher, Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) teachers.    If Tier 2 interventions take place and the student continues to find difficulty achieving academic success, our PPT will meet  once again to discuss the student.  At this time, Tier 3 interventions will be discussed, including the possibility of a special  education bilingual evaluation to determine if the student has any special education needs.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   For the 2017-18 school year, we have 20 English Language Learners and 13 Former ELLs.  22 students were administered  the NYSESLAT in the spring of 2017.  10 students performed at the commanding level; 9 students performed at the expanding  level; 1 at the transitioning level; 2 remained entering, as they entered the country late in the school year.   Based on the May 2017 NYSESLAT results for our students, we can see many ELLs are making steady progress. Many of our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          98         students performed at the Commanding level and the majority of all ELLs tested, performed at either the Expanding level or at  the Commanding level.  It is our belief that the increased use of Thinking Maps and a cohesive ENL pull-out program, rich in  reading, writing and word study, enabled our students to achieve their highest level possible.  In addition to the NYSESLAT,  state exams, classroom assessments and teacher observations are used to drive instruction and identify individual student  needs in developing and strengthening their English language skills.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Both administrators and teachers come together when outcome assessment data is released regarding our ELLs and their  progress.  Data sources include, but are not limited to, the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and EDAT findings.    Meetings are led by the ENL Teacher and Coordinator during professional development time on Mondays and Tuesdays.  As a  staff, we assess the data carefully, looking for trends across grades, populations, and ability levels.  Depending on our findings,  we carefully decide upon possible changes to our practice in order to best support our student's academic success.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At PS 188 we utilize both standalone and integrated ENL programs.  We do not have any Transitional Bilingual or Dual  Language programs at our school. The ENL schedule was created to fulfill and meet all required integrated and stand- alone ENL sessions as per CR Part 154.2  The ENL teacher has a dual license and can fulfill multiple requirements while  teaching the Grade K-5 ENL students at our main building and annex.  The groupings are heterogeneous by level and  combine up to two grade levels as per New York State mandates.  The children receive small group instruction in  English by our ENL teacher as she is dually certified in Common Branch (CB) and Teaching English to Speakers of Other  Languages (TESOL).      Our standalone ENL sessions are conducted in a separate ENL classroom.  The children receiving these services focus  on their needs as determined by the results of multiple assessments, including but not limited to the New York State  Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL), the NYSESLAT, running records, non-fiction writing  assignments, and unit exams.  The standalone sessions are a warm and supportive environment allowing the students  to feel safe taking chances, promoting growth in all learning environments.    A workshop model in reading and writing is followed in our classrooms.   The REACH ENL program, created by  National Geographic, was chosen due to it's strong focus on non fiction texts.  The ENL teacher supports this model in  her class by using guided reading, read alouds, shared reading, shared writing, close reading of short, complex texts  and zooming in on juicy sentences.  She also uses vocabulary word walls, word work and grammar lessons using  Cunningham and Snowball’s methodology, accountable talk, role play and Total Physical Response (TPR).  She also  coaches the children in writing through individual conferences and small group strategy lessons.  The ENL teacher  supports classroom instruction and school-wide curriculum by reviewing math, science and social studies content  lessons with ELLs using sheltered English and scaffolding techniques to ensure they are learning essential,  academic vocabulary and core concepts.      Teaching strategies include:  (1) scaffolding- modeling, bridging, contextualizing, use of realia, schema building;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          99         (2) graphic organizers or thinking maps;  (3) tape recorder/CD player/MP3;  (4) TPR;  (5) nursery rhymes;  (6) cooperative food preparation;  (7) puppetry, songs, and jazz chants;  (8) bookmaking;  (9) role play and readers’ theatre;  (10) using JUICY sentences to teach complex sentence structure and the purpose of phrases and sentence stems. (11)  Whole Brain Teaching (formerly called power teaching) to engage all students.      All of these strategies lead to greater language acquisition and enriched language communication and expression.     In addition, the ENL library is leveled, as are all classroom libraries. Books from and about native countries are  included.  Native customs and cultures are given recognition which helps our students feel a sense of pride for their  heritage and native countries while learning to assimilate to customs and traditions of the United States.             b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our ENL teacher and Assistant Principal work together to create a comprehensive ENL schedule which coordinates groupings  based on the grade and proficiency level of our ENL students.  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results are utilized for planning and  scheduling to ensure all mandates are met for each student.  Additionally, the ENL teacher is dually certified as a common  branch teacher and TESOL, allowing her to teach both standalone ENL as well as integrated ENL/ELA.   Our schedule  incorporates both a pull-out and push-in model in order to meet the minimum requirements of mandated ENL minutes of  instruction.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our ENL program includes a wide variety of instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible and foster  language development to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS).  The REACH ESL program is a  CCLS program.  All materials selected by our staff are designed to satisfy CCLS including Reading Street, GO Math!,  Fundations, writing workshop, word study units, author studies, science and technology.  Minilessons are taught to ELLs,  including specific reading and writing strategies, to help them make gains in their academic language.  The National  Geographic REACH ENL texts and the Reading Street Literacy Program (as well as all other content area textbooks) are age and  grade appropriate as deemed by New York State Standards and CCLS.  These programs were carefully selected by both  administration and teachers on multiple grade levels.  Apple TVs, iPads, and the Internet on both laptop and desktop  computers are used to provide countless resources for specific ages and grade levels.  For example, we use BrainPop for Gr 3-5  and BrainPop Jr. for Gr K-2.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers also employ different teaching strategies and styles to  meet the needs of the students by age and grade, providing texts, tasks and facilitating academic conversations that are  appropriate for students in that particular grade.   Additionally, ELLs with IEPs have specific and individual mandates to ensure  the support and resources they receive are appropriate for their specific needs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          100      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   This question is not applicable since we only have a Freestanding English As a New Language program.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We differentiate instruction for all our ELLs based on their individual and group needs.    A. We do not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE).  Should we have SIFE students, we would:  •     First assess to determine specific needs  •     Offer parent workshops  •     Mandate AIS  programs  •     Offer Saturday school  •     Offer peer tutoring  •     Offer Learning Leaders (parent volunteers) help in the classroom     B. Many of the ELLs we serve at PS 188 are Newcomers who have been in US public schools for three years or less.  These  students learn best through the use of background knowledge, stories, songs, and multisensory lessons.  The ENL teacher  focuses instruction on academic vocabulary, social language, Early Emergent literacy skills (including letter recognition and  letter sounds) and uses many technology-driven strategies in order to build a rich vocabulary.  We also do a lot of guided  reading and shared reading work.      For newcomers we also:  •     Provide the students with a tour of the school to meet staff and see classrooms/ gym/ lunchroom etc.  •     Buddy up the student with someone who speaks their language  •     Label objects around the classroom and in the halls  •     Provide parent workshops to model for parents what is going on in classroom and advise them on how they can support  their child   •     Publish monthly newsletters from classroom teacher to parents to keep parents apprised of curriculum  •     Parent coordinator does outreach work and provides letters in different languages    Additionally, third, fourth and fifth grade ELLs who are required to take the NYS exams in May receive additional guidance and  learn test sophistication strategies to help them through standardized tests.  The ENL teacher helps these upper grade ELLs  become familiar with the format of the exams and conducts mini practice tests with them throughout the year to help solidify  a few core test taking skills.     C. For our Developing ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of service, the ENL teacher focuses instruction on the classroom  curriculum.  Students work on reading, writing, math, social studies, and science with both their classroom teacher and with  the ENL teacher to ensure that they are holding onto core concepts from the curriculum.  The ENL teacher uses word walls,  graphs, charts, partnership discussion, conferences, and picture books as well as text books and multimedia resources to  review all grade level appropriate vocabulary and all content based vocabulary.  The ENL teacher also reinforces any test  taking strategies that are being reviewed in the classroom in preparation for the NYS exams in May.  When necessary, we also  offer developing students AIS instruction, extended day and early morning test prep classes, and suggest to parents that they  should find a high school student or other neighborhood volunteer to act as a tutor for their child after school if they cannot  afford to hire a tutor. We also try to encourage students in the ENL program to join extracurricular activities, i.e. baseball,  tennis, music, dance or art lessons etc..     6d.  If we had any long-term ELLs, our ENL teacher would work alongside the students in a small group setting and approach   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          101      the classwork with a co-teaching mentality, particularly in social studies. science, and in both reading and writing  workshop.  This is to ensure deep academic rigor for the student and to provide the greatest amount of scaffolding with the  goal that the child would pass the NYSESLAT before moving onto middle school.       6e.   We have many ELLs who have passed the NYSESLAT and are now receiving mandated extended services for up to two  years after passing the exam as per CR Part 154.  These students have ENL two periods each week, allowing for a smooth  transition out of the ENL program.  These commanding level ELLs will receive a push-in model when possible.  Their instruction  supports the CCLS and the work they are doing in their classrooms.  The ENL teacher provides support by providing the  necessary scaffolds the children may need in order to achieve academic success on the daily assignments given by the  classroom teacher.  The ENL teacher also engages these students in higher order thinking questioning and teaches the  deconstruction of "juicy" text to lift the level of each reader.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   As a school, we take pride in the academic progress of English language learners with disabilities at our school.  Our staff is  dedicated to supporting these students in every way we can in order to help them make academic progress throughout the  school year.  Fortunately, our ENL provider is New York State certified in TESOL as well as teaching Students with  Disabilities.  In addition, the provider works hand in hand with all teachers, including the special education teachers and other  service providers of children with disabilities.    Students with disabilities are provided a multisensory approach to learning English in the ENL classroom.  Children follow the  curriculum with hands-on, interactive lessons while navigating through multiple data-driven strategies including the following:    •    iPad, Apple TV, Apps and games  •     National Geographic's REACH ESL Series K-5  •     Reading Street Literacy program for K-5  •     White boards and Expo markers  •     Puppets and Realia  •     NYSESLAT  Test Prep by Anastasio  •     GO Math!  •     Oxford Picture Dictionary  •     Open Sesame Picture Dictionary  •     Maps and Atlases  •     Big Books  •     “Ranger Rick” Children’s Magazine by National Geographic  •     Passport to Social Studies  •     Jazz Chants and Songs  •     Related Educational Games and Puzzles  •     Word Walls and Vocabulary Charts  •     Photo Cards and Index Cards  •     TC Leveled Books for independent reading/ assessment     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  English Language Learner-Students with Disabilities (ELL-SWD) who have special needs are provided with differentiated  instruction in different modalities.  A comprehensive schedule is created in the beginning of the school year, taking into  account all curriculum and related service requirements in order to assure each child is receiving the appropriate services in  both amount and content in the least restrictive environment.  Students are simultaneously enrolled in the ENL program along  with all services determined by his or her Individualized Education Plan while attaining English proficiency.    After identifying particular need(s) through multiple assessments with the school psychologist, classroom teacher, and ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          102      teacher, along with indications on the IEP, students are grouped by need and given appropriate individualized instruction by  special education support teachers.  All of our ELLs who are identified as having special needs are also grouped together by  grade.  The ENL teacher  focuses on literacy rich activities to help bolster vocabulary acquisition and language  development.  We do a lot juicy sentence work and spend time revisiting and deconstructing text together.  This group  requires more 1:1 writing conference time and also responds better to games and to multimedia interaction as a way of  learning.  Much of the student's time is spent in guided reading groups and writing literary and non-fiction responses in all ENL  classes.      The ENL teacher works in tandem with all the students' classroom teachers and other service providers (e.g. speech, OT, PT,  guidance) to support all content based work going on in the classroom.  The ENL teacher is active about pursuing up to date  information on the emotional/social and physical well being of each student, especially that of her ELL-SWD since many of  them receive  multiple services throughout the day.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The goal of our instruction of ELLs is to achieve academic success by designing our instruction based on needs derived from  individual assessments and data throughout the school year.  Instruction for all students is differentiated based on individual  student needs.  Targeted instruction for ELLs is determined by the classroom teacher and ENL teacher through specific  assessments administered to students in identifying the specific skills and strategies needed for each unit.    Targeted intervention programs include:  ELA:  Fundations & Wilson  Math:  Go Math! RtI and enrichment resources  Social Studies/Science: small groups and individual conferences with the classroom teacher    All programs are provided in English.    Our classroom and ENL teachers work together in order to provide the best instruction possible for our ELLs.  While  working together, teachers are able to provide individualized, small group instruction and one to one instruction to ELLs who  may need the extra support, particularly in social studies and science, where the vocabulary and concepts are often difficult  for ELLs to tackle on their own.      When funding is available, our school offers early morning tutorial classes at 7:30 am as part of a targeted intervention  program to help ELLs and other students requiring additional support in reading, writing, and math during part of the academic  year.  These AIS classes start in mid-December or January and run until March or April. They focus specifically on test  sophistication strategies and help students to become familiar and more comfortable with the format of the NYS exams and  offer them another opportunity to practice their test taking skills in another small group setting.  These programs are offered  in English only and all ELLs are invited to participate.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Each year, our school looks at data across the grades and across our school as a whole in order to see what programs have best  benefited our students and what programs may need improvement.  This year, we are proud to see our ELA and Math state  test scores in number one spots in District 26.  While our scores are often quite high, we are always looking to improve our  instructional practice.    For the upcoming school year, all grades will be implementing the Passport to Social Studies curriculum for the first time as we  observed a need for improved alignment in our Social Studies curriculum across the grades.   In addition, we will be  implementing Go Math! as our new mathematics program as we have seen the success the program has had while  collaborating with other schools in our district.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          103      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  We have an anti-bullying school-wide program that all students  participate in.  We also have special shows and assemblies sponsored by the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) which all the  children enjoy watching.  We have many after-school programs including NYC's Out-of-School-Time (OST), Blueberry, and our  own self sustaining after-school program.  These programs are fun and educational for ELLs and other students to participate  in.  Children receive help with their homework from trained staff, counselors, and teachers.  This also allows them to  participate in different activities from their typical school day, which helps further enrich language development in a less  academic, less formal setting.  Other programs ELLs particularly benefit from in our school are the wonderful programs of art,  dance, music, computer and physical education.  All cluster teachers are aware of the ability level of each ELL are the building  and ensures they are attentive to their individual language needs in class.  For example, the art teacher will repeat a set of  directions for an ELL student and model for the student what to do rather than just give oral directions (which could exclude an  ELL from full participation).  ELLs can express themselves in languages other than English in art and through movement during  the school day as well as at recess and after-school.   We also offer lunch programs, such as basketball, cheerleading, computer  club, and book clubs.  ELLs are able to choose an area of interest and participate during recess.  All of these programs are in  addition to the foundation of academics here at PS 188.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  PS 188 is committed to using the best instructional materials for our students, supported by data-driven research and child- focused content.  The following list includes the instructional materials used by our Entering, Emerging, Transitioning,  Expanding, and Commanding ELLs, arranged by grade.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Dual Language (DL):  N/A as we do not offer this program at our school.    Transitional Bilingual Education(TBE):   N/A as we do not offer this program at our school.    English as a New Language:  The native language of an ELL is highly valued at our school for both instructional and social  support.  Our ELLs are provided with iPads with translation applications and foreign language dictionaries for personal use  throughout the day.  We have bilingual glossaries in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, and  Farsi.  Translation services and translated documents/letters home are also provided for parents of ELLs.  We work with the  many members of our staff who are bilingual, as well as our active parent community, in order to assess our level of support  for both our students and families.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our ELLs are grouped according to the guidelines outlined by the NYS CR Part 154 - 2 Regulations.  We also do our best to  group our ELLs within one grade, and always within the maximum 2-year grade span (as outlined by the aforementioned  regulations) to be sure our required services and support corresponds to our ELLs' age and grade level.    The National Geographic REACH ESL texts and the Reading Street Literacy Program as well as all other content area textbooks  are age and grade appropriate as deemed by New York State standards and were carefully selected by both administration and  teachers on multiple grade levels.  The iPad and Apple TV as well as the Internet provide multiple resources and videos and  games that are broken down specifically by age level or by grade.  For example, we use BrainPop for Gr 3-5 and BrainPop Jr. for  Gr K-2.      The ENL teacher and classroom teachers also employ different teaching strategies and styles to meet the needs of the students  by age and grade, providing texts, tasks and facilitating academic conversations that are appropriate for our students in each  particular grade.   Additionally, ELLs with IEPs have specific and individual mandates to ensure the support and resources they  receive are appropriate for their specific needs.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Due to the growth of our PS 188 community, we have two buildings in which to provide academic services to our children.  Our  main building serves students in grades 1-5 while our annex serves students in Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten.    Our ENL service provider has a classroom space in both our main building and annex.  Both classrooms are fully stocked in  order to provide the best academic, linguistic, and socioemotional support for our ELLs in all grades.  Depending on the  academic and social needs of our students, materials will travel back and forth between buildings throughout the school year.    The following is a list of supplies available to our students in both locations:     •    iPad with applications specifically designed for ELLs  •     National Geographic REACH ESL series K-5  •     Reading Street Literacy program for K-5  •     White boards and Expo markers  •     Puppets  •     NYSESLAT  Test Prep by Anastasio  •     GO Math!  •     Oxford Picture Dictionary  •     Open Sesame Picture Dictionary  •     Maps and Atlases  •     Big Books   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          106         •    Passport to Social Studies  •   Chants and Songs  •     Related Educational Games and Puzzles  •     Word Walls and Vocabulary Charts  •     Photo Cards and Index Cards  •     TC Leveled Books for independent reading/ assessment       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each summer, we provide all our students with a summer reading list.  All newly enrolled ELLs and their families are  encouraged to visit the public library and begin reading from this list.  The ENL teacher also contacts the student and his or her  family once she has received information about a new student.  The parent coordinator is also informed of the home language  of newly enrolled ELLs and will prepare to provide the family with as many translated documents as necessary.      As ELLs enroll throughout the year, the new student is assigned a class buddy who also speaks the home language.  The buddy  helps the new student with any question he/she may have and helps the ELL acclimate to routines in the classroom the first  few weeks of school.  The cluster teachers are informed of the new ELL student and the ENL teacher begins to work with the  student immediately after finding out what level the ELL is functioning on via the NYSITELL or NYSELAT score in the student's  exam history or by giving the exam herself.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We are not currently offering any language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL provider attends ELL-centered workshops provided by our Children First Network (CFN) as well as  the NYCDOE Division of ELLs and Support Services throughout the school year.  This support assures our students are  constantly being supported with the most up-to-date, comprehensive instructional approaches to the Common Core Learning  Standards.    During the last instructional year, our ENL teacher was able to attend a monthly professional development series  entitled Common Core Aligned Writing Strategies for ELLs.  She also attended the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol  (SIOP) Model K-5,  as well as the summer professional learning session entitled ELL Summer Teacher Institute.  In addition, our  ENL teacher attends District 26 Liason Meetings whenever available in order to remain updated on the most recent regulations  regarding ENL.  Titles of these meetings include ELL-Related Topics and Regulations and Turnkey Training for the NYSESLAT.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          107         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ELL teacher and administration provides ELL training for our school's staff throughout the school year during select  Monday and Tuesday afternoon professional development in order to meet the professional development requirements of  New York's CR Part 154.2 regulation.  Our teachers also attend workshops provided by the Queens North CFN and the  Department of Education.  The school's administration keeps a record of professional development hours completed by each  individual teacher in the building.  An agenda and attendance sheet is developed for each workshop in order to maintain  accurate records of these meetings.  Comprehensive records are stored in the Principal's office.    Some examples of workshops the ELL teacher has provided or will provide for the staff include:       A)  Reading Workshop Conferences with ELLs       B)  Writing Workshop Conferences with ELLs       C)  TPR (Total Physical Response) Storytelling/ Role Play and Other Activities with ELLs       D)  Vocabulary Word Play      E) Helping ELLs Look at Figurative Language      F)  How Virtual Field Trips Can Help ELLs     G)  Mapping Meaning to Text to Help Our ELLs      H)  How to Help Deconstruct and Reconstruct JUICY sentences      I)  Helping ELLs to Identify the Language Function of a Phrase of Clause      J) Language Frames and How They Can Help ELLs with Inferencing      K) How ELLs Can Pay Attention to Shades of Meaning: Building Vocabulary Knowledge      L)  What is the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT?  (every year)    M) What is the Purpose of the HLIS?  How to Read/Help Complete the HLIS (every year)    N) Unlocking Research on ELLs    O)  Text, Talk, and Tasks for ELL Success in the Classroom    P)  What is ELAND and what will it mean for some of your ELLs?    Q)  What is the LAP and the LTI ?    R)  What Apps are Useful for ELLs on the Ipad in the Classroom?      S) Carol Dweck and How to Use a Growth Mindset to Improve Student Motivation and Boost Learning    T)  Using Reader's Theatre to Help ELLs Become Stronger Readers and Speakers    Every year, our staff receives a comprehensive list of ELLs in our school.  All teachers are informed of each child's current level,  class, and home language.  Cluster teachers and classroom teachers tailor their curriculum in order to differentiate for the  needs of the many different learners in their class, including ELLs.  Repetition of directions, modeling, movement and music is  often used throughout the day to support the learning of ELLs.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher contacts ELL parents regularly on Tuesday afternoons for a telephone conference to discuss goals,  assessments, language development and content area academics.  She keeps a log of the PTC phone conferences and also  invites parents to come in person to meet to discuss their child's progress.  Translation services are provided via telephone   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          108            services through the NYCDOE Interpretation and Translation Unit or by one of our staff members.  We are lucky enough to  have a multilingual staff.  The ENL teacher also uses her prep period to contact parents regarding their child's progress.     Parents of ELLs are continuously informed about wonderful citywide and district events/workshops.  We use hard copy letters  and emails in both English and in the child’s native home language so all parents have knowledge of these events.  Some of  these events include free ENL classes for parents of ELLs who want to improve their own language skills.  There is also a  Blueberry and MYAP after-school program operated in our building.  The directors have many clients that are the parents of  our ELL students.  They provide extended after-school care for children of parents who work extremely long days.           2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our ELL parent population is very important to us at PS 188.  We do everything in our power to encourage a strong home- school connection and this includes specific activities that foster parent involvement.  These activities include, but are not  limited to:    -Meet the Teacher Night  -Monthly PTA meetings  -Parent Teacher Conferences   -Monthly newsletters to parents, available in multiple languages  -Parent Coordinator School Website, available in multiple languages  -Cultural Events including our annual Lunar New Year show  -Fall Family Night  -Zumba Tuesdays    We encourage all of our families to become active members of the PS 188 community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janet Caraisco, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          110                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 188Q The Kingsbury School                                                                              School DBN: 26Q188  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our school conducted a needs assessment for both oral and written translation services. We interviewed parents  mainly through the parent coordinator to assess what translation needs our parent population has. We also have  information from the HLIS and the Emergency Blue Cards. As per Chancellor's Regulations, the primary language  of the parents are determined within 30 days of enrollment and recorded onto ATS and the blue emergency cards  at our school. The school also consults the ENL teacher to see what other written or oral translations may be  needed throughout the building. Our school has limited translation needs. About 75% of our parent population  speak English only. About 25% speak another language at home but the majority of bilingual parents at our school  prefer home-school communication in English and have made the school aware of their preference through  conversations/ request through the classroom teacher or by informing the office staff. The ENL teacher follows up  with any parents of ELLs to see if they require any translation services as well. About 97% of our parent  population speak and read English. There are only a handful of parents who require oral and written translation  services at our school. This finding is in alignment with the percentage of ELL students we have at our school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          112      which is currently just below 5 %.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We continuously use the School Messenger voice mail system to notify our families of school-wide information and  events. In the event of an emergency, we would create a message in English and follow the message with the same  information in any languages needed by our families. In addition, we would send out the same message, in the  multiple languages needed, in a school-wide email blast to families.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At our opening day conferences, staff met with administration to review the chancellor's regulations. It was explained  to staff that they can utilize their colleagues to serve as translators or provide written translation as needed. Staff was  also provided information for the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit to be used as needed.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school has posted signage in multiple languages in the vestibule, main office, parent coordinator's office, and by  the security agent's desk to notify parents about the translation and interpretation services we have available. In  addition to the signage posted we have a binder at the security desk, in the main office and in the parent coordinators  office with the current "Parents Bill of Rights and Responsibilities" in all the languages spoken in the school. As per  chancellor's regulations, within 30 days of school enrollment, a parent's primary language is assessed via interview  and recorded on ATS and on the blue emergency cards. The ELL teacher and the parent coordinator work together to  ensure that parents are informed about translation services both at PS 188 and online through the Department of  Education website where several important documents have already been translated and made available in several   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          117      languages. For example, the HLIS is available in multiple languages at our school. The Parents' Bill of Rights,  notification of special services forms, notification of citywide ELL parent meetings, ELL parent orientation forms and  the parent selection survey are also all provided in multiple languages- Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Korean are the  languages we receive requests for translation in at our school. Again, we use in-house school staff, parent volunteers,  online resources through the DOE and the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit's services to provide oral and  written translation resources for our parents. Although we do provide all these resources, it should be noted again,  that 97% of our parent population is able to read, write, speak, and understand English and have made it known to  the school that their personal preference is to have communication with the school in English.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school plans on using the Parent Survey as a primary source of information. We also plan on having the Parent  Coordinator conduct interview with parents to gather their feedback on the quality and availability of services. When  parent workshop are conducted, we will collect satisfaction surveys and analyze the data. The Parent Coordinator will  schedule a focus group, inclusive of all cultures and languages to gather feedback and best practices on  communicating with families. The PTA will also be a great resource for us and will be able to provide with a lot of data  regarding quality and availability.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          118
