This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The International High School @ Prospect Heights empowers recent immigrant students by teaching them fluency in  reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English through a rigorous curriculum that is language rich,  interdisciplinary, and project based. Students learn to think critically, navigate societal constructs, and prepare for  college and other education after high school. Students, staff and families create a caring school environment that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      promotes collaboration, cross-cultural interaction, and appreciation of diversity. Above all, International High School  students become successful contributing members of society and conscientious global citizens of the future.      A member of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, our school implements the International Approach to  English Language Development. There are five core principles that form the basis for this approach:   1.  Heterogeneity and collaboration: Heterogeneous and collaborative structures that build on the strengths of   every individual member of the school community optimize learning.   2.  Experiential learning: Expansion of the school beyond its four walls motivates adolescents and enhances their   capacity to successfully participate in modern society.   3.  Language and content integration: Language skills are most effectively learned in context and emerge most   naturally in purposeful, language-rich, experiential, interdisciplinary study.   4.  Localized autonomy and responsibility: Linking autonomy and responsibility at every level within a learning   community allows all members to contribute to their fullest potential.    5.  One learning model for all: Exposing all learners—faculty and students—to the same learning model   maximizes their ability to support each other.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The International High School at Prospect Heights, 17K524, is a part of the Internationals Network for Public Schools.  We serve recently arrived immigrant students who have been in the United States for less than four years and are  new learners of English. Internationals schools adhere to five core principles: heterogeneous groupings that foster  collaboration among peers; experiential, project-based learning; language and content integration to facilitate  academic language acquisition; localized autonomy and responsibility for teachers to create and develop their own  curriculum; and the idea that all learners (faculty and students) experience the same learning model to maximize their  ability to support each other.   Our students are required to pass the Common Core Algebra and Comprehensive English Regents exams. In addition,  as a result of a waiver from the New York State Education Department, our students produce a commencement  portfolio consisting of: 1) performance based assessment tasks (PBATs) in Social Studies, Science, English, and  Mathematics; 2) a Native Language Project ; and 3) a personal statement. Each PBAT includes a written component  plus an oral presentation, during which students explain and defend their written work and subject- matter- knowledge before an evaluative panel. PBATs serve as summative assessments of students’ learning in core subjects  and demonstrate college readiness.      Students at the International HS at Prospect Heights come to us with a wide range of academic and linguistic needs.  We believe that language development is achieved when students receive interdisciplinary content area instruction  while working in heterogeneous groups. We believe that learning and language are social constructs, and that  students need a sense of purpose, a forum for negotiating meaning with each other, and opportunities to  demonstrate tangible results of their learning in order to develop both academic and linguistic proficiencies. Project- based instruction provides scaffolds to students at different levels of proficiency and allows access to the content. At  the same time, it helps students develop the social and academic language and literacy skills necessary to complete  the project successfully. All curricula at our school aim to achieve both academic and linguistic goals.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Teachers work in small instructional teams to develop challenging, engaging, interdisciplinary project-based curricula.  To facilitate curriculum development within and across teams, our teachers’ schedules provide time for teachers to  meet in their interdisciplinary and disciplinary planning teams. Teachers work in these forums to develop curriculum  that aligns with state and Common Core standards while maintaining our school’s model and mission. The  interdisciplinary team is the most important structure in our school. Teachers are organized into four interdisciplinary  teams representing five or more subjects(English/ENL, social studies, science, math, and electives), and each team is  responsible for the academic and social emotional needs of approximately 100 students. Two of the teams work with  9th and 10th grade students in mixed grade classes (the Lower School) and two of the teams work with single grade  classes, one with the 11th graders, and one with the 12th graders (the Upper School). All teams group students  heterogeneously in classes of approximately 26 students based on: 1) native languages spoken; 2) English language  proficiency; 3) educational achievement; 4) etc. Students travel with their classes all day, and students stay with their  teachers for two years. Consequently, teachers and students come to know each other well.       Our advisory program ensures that each student is known and supported by a teacher of their classes. One advisor  follows 12 to 18 students, typically for a minimum of two years. Our advisory program curriculum is structured by  grade to support students through their various stages of development at our school. The 9th grade advisories focus  on community building and integration into our school and our approach to learning. The 10th grade advisories focus  on health and sexuality issues. The 11th grade advisories focus on college exploration. The 12th grade advisories focus  on transitioning out via college applications and outside internships. The College Advisor works closely with our 11th  and 12th grade advisors to support them in this work. Advisors maintain close contact with their colleagues to  facilitate awareness and understanding of their advisees’ social and academic progress. A referral process allows all  staff to alert an advisor to potential concerns. Advisors connect with students’ families during parent teacher  conferences and at other times as needed to facilitate parental awareness and involvement. Advisors support each  other in planning advisory lessons during twice monthly planning periods.       Collaborative teamwork is central to our teaching practices. In addition to weekly team meetings and twice monthly  staff sessions (different from advisory planning), teachers visit one another's classrooms to learn from one another  and reflect on their practice. These targeted intervisitations optimize growth and development among staff members  and provide opportunities for teachers to provide and receive feedback on effective teaching practices.      The International HS at Prospect Heights also has a comprehensive career internship program. Every student must  complete a career internship. Students become aware of future career possibilities as they acquire job skills while  working in schools, hospitals, courts, museums, law firms, computer labs, non-profits, and in private enterprise. The  internship program takes place during the spring semester of the students’ senior year. These internships provide  networking for our student and can lead to post graduation employment.     A wide array of extracurricular activities facilitate our school's linguistic, academic, and social goals. These are  coordinated by the Coordinator for Special Programs and include various ethnic clubs, drama, journalism, dance,  science, strength training, music ensemble, etc. Teachers and partner organizations also facilitate after school  activities and provide students additional resources and opportunities to extend their school experience and facilitate  their social, linguistic, and academic growth.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      All students in our school are admitted as English language learners (ELLs), but many graduate our school having  achieved full English language proficiency. Within our student population, there are sub-groups to which we give  special focus. These include: 1) students with limited or interrupted formal education (SIFE/SLIFE); 2) students with  individual education plans (IEPs); and 3) students with social/emotional crises. Our instructional focus is aligned with  the unique needs of ELLs. Content teachers are supported by special education staff and para support personnel in  addressing the needs of students with IEPs. And our guidance staff, consisting of social workers and a college  counselor, assist advisors and teachers to focus on the needs of students with social/emotional needs. The many  needs of all students are reviewed and addressed each week during collaborative team meetings, which include  teachers and guidance personnel, and focus on grade specific administrative, curriculum, and guidance needs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous instruction: the 2017-2018 academic year began with the implementation of a new team structure and a  new bell schedule, which allowed adding a fifth-core content at each grade level. The fifth-core at each grade level  provided opportunities for new subjects to be taught, thus increasing college preparedness. We have increased the  number of students taking AP classes, college classes, and college indexed courses through our College Access for All  program. In addition, as participants of the CS for All initiative, all 12 graders and 30% of juniors received instruction  in Computer Science. We plan on continuing our progress in these areas for 2018-2019.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K524   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   417   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Recent school quality metrics, including our 2016-17 School Quality Guide, indicate an overall strong performance (4.7  of 5.0 overall) with particularly strong NYC School Survey Measures in Literacy, Course Clarity, and quality of student  discussion. The most recent Quality Review ratings in this area were "well developed." Upper school teams and  administration continuously monitor and react to key performance metrics relating to the passing of Regents  examinations, student achievement on Performance Based Assessment Tasks, and credit accumulations.      Per our NYSED performance reports, secondary-level English language arts proficiency after four years of instruction  dropped from 67% in 2015 and 68% in 2016 to 53% in 2017. Similarly, secondary-level mathematics proficiency  dropped from 80% in 2015 and 85% in 2016 to 65% in 2017. NYSED proficiency level data in social studies and science  are not meaningful for schools with Regents waivers since Regents scores are not available for year-to-year  comparisons.      Per NYSED performance reports, the graduation rates for all students in 2017 was 85% and 90% in 2018. These  graduation rates are significantly higher than the state-wide graduation rates for ELLs.      Our instructional focus during 2018-2019 will continue to be on generating and delivering high quality rigorous  instruction with both language and content area objectives for every lesson. The adequacy of supports necessary to  attain proficiency levels in English language arts and mathematics will be closely monitored and addressed.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   We will achieve a graduation rate of at least 67% by supporting students in achieving the key graduation requirements:  core course credits, performance-based assessment tasks (PBATs); CC ELA and CC Algebra regents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the  activities and strategies your school will  implement to achieve the identified goal  for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will  be  targeted?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our strengths relative to this Framework element are evidenced in our most recent School Quality Snapshot (2017- 18), which assigns a total rating of 4.99 out of 5.0 in this category. Supporting evidence from the School Survey  indicates that 100% of our teachers agreed that the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make our school run  effectively. 100% of teachers agreed that teachers talk with one another about instruction and make a conscious  effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade levels.   Teachers' schedules are structured to ensure that teachers have at least thee hours each week for collaborative  planning activities with other teachers, guidance staff, and administration in the pursuit of instructional rigor and  coherence and the social/emotional support of students.   Our school structures were created based on the belief that professional development occurs through the  interactions between teachers and other teachers, teachers and administrators, and teachers and guidance staff and  our schedule is designed to ensure that these interactions occur in structured ways every week. Understanding the  centrality of our core structures to professional development is key to understanding the high sense of collaboration  expressed by our teachers in the school quality snap shot.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Our strengths relative to this Framework element are evidenced in our most recent School Quality Snapshot (2017- 18), which assigns a total rating of 3.66 out of 5.0 in this category. Over 80% of the parents responding to our School  Environment Survey agreed that they: 1) communicated with teachers (97%); 2) saw their children's school work  (90%); 3) attend school events (83%); and 4) are likely to go to parent-teacher conferences (89%). Our last School  Quality Review resulted in a proficient rating in the area of partnering with families to support student success.  Although our School Quality Snapshot metrics are above citywide averages in the areas of trust and community- building between parents and the school, our predominantly immigrant and refugee student population requires a  much more holistic and ambitious effort on the part of the school to truly build community.   Our students and their families rely on our school for information and resources related to basic needs, including  housing, access to city, state, and federal services, social/emotional support and counseling, legal services, and a  variety of other resources. During the fourteen years of our school's existence, we have worked hard to meet the  needs of students and families who come from more than three dozen countries and speak more than two dozen  languages. In our highly diverse linguistic environment, the ability to overcome language based obstacles to  communications is central to creating strong family and community ties in our school population.   Our priority needs relative to strong family and community ties in the 2018-19 academic year involve sustaining and  building the structures and skills necessary to communicate with and meet the needs of a highly diverse immigrant  and refugee school community.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  As a school that serves a 100% ELL or former ELL population, it is a priority to hire teachers who are dually-certified in  ENL and their content area. In addition, we encourage all highly qualified content teachers to obtain a secondary  certificate in ENL. We also endeavor to provide information and referrals for our staff to explore PD and certification  options.      We use a collaborative process in our recruitment, retention, assignments, and support of teachers. Specifically:   --for recruitment, we use a hiring committee to search for, vet, interview, and select teacher candidates   --for retention, we use our various teacher teams and school committees to facilitate discussions among professionals  that establish trust and provide professional collegial support   --for assignments, our Personnel Committee convenes throughout the spring to consider teacher assignment  preferences and make thoughtful groupings of teacher teams and assignments   --for support, our Professional Development Committee coordinates a variety of opportunities for formative support  of teachers, including intervisitations, success shares, curriculum shares, etc.        2b.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)       Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K524, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.              Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend our school and will work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Data from our extensive intake process, SIFE interview tool, and diagnostic and formative assessments that are in alignment  with the performance-based assessment standards of the Consortium in every content area show that our students enter our  program with a wide variety of prior schooling, academic skills, and literacy skills (in both English and their native languages).  These data provide teachers with the information they need to properly differentiate their content area, project-based  curricula, which is delivered to a student population that is heterogeneous on many fronts. The results of these assessments  indicate that a majority of our students enter our school with below grade-level literacy  levels. SIFE students show levels well  below 4  th   grade. As a result, the school continues to place great emphasis on teaching literacy and integrating language and  content areas in all grades and in all classes through out the school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Interdisciplinary Teams meet 3x per week during the school day, and 1x per week in discipline to engage in inquiry work to  adjust instruction based on student data, to share curriculum and plan in order to ensure multiple access points for all  students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ELL programs is determined by examining graduation rates (and length of time taken to matriculate), course  pass rates, regents pass rates, and PBAT pass rates. These results are consistently reviewed at a team, department, committee,  and school wide level to better determine the effectiveness of school programming.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    To support our effort the school has in place:     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   n/a     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns across all grades on the NYSESLAT and Lab-R indicate that at least 85% of our students enter our school at the  beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency in all areas. Data indicate students show growth in reading, writing, listening,  and speaking as they progress through the grades in our school, with students advancing one or more levels by the 12  th  grade in all modalities.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data is shared regularly in teacher team meetings in the school day weekly. The administration team that consists of the  Principal, the AP of Administration, and the AP of Instruction in ESL meet weekiy.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to six teachers (ESL and content area) who work  to plan instruction for groups of approximately 75 to 100 students.  Class sizes are reduced to less than 30 students in  any instructional group.  All teachers use language development/English as a Second Language techniques to assist  students in learning the English language.  Our school uses all a heterogeneous, ungraded model in the 9th and 10th  grade, and heterogeneous but graded model in the 11th and 12th grades.  Each group of students is block  programmed and those students travel together throughout the day.  The blocks are heterogeneous but at various  times teachers may choose to group students within the block homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s  needs for a specific project.  We do not provide pull-out instruction.  However, students who struggle with literacy  receive a supplemental SIFE/literacy class for  two or three  65 minute periods per week in lieu of an extra elective  period.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Mandated Instructional minutes:  As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2015, students will be carefully programmed to receive the  mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will receive a  minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 180 minutes of standalone or intergrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will  receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and  90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning willl receive 180  ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone  or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this  consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former  ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)   We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes through  discrete ESL classes as well as classes taught by dual certified ESL/content area teachers. Each instructional team includes at  least one teacher who is licensed in ESL; in addition, all of our content area teachers are trained in language development and  ESL methodologies and encouraged to pursue ESL certification.  The school schedule and teacher programming ensure that all  entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes required according to CR Part 154.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All students take math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every year.  Although the language that teachers use  is  English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is collaboratively determined – students use  both English and their native languages to explore content and the locus of control for language is student-driven by the  content and the students’ needs.  Instruction is not unidirectional from teacher to student in our school.  Students work in  groups to complete collaborative tasks that both develop language and content knowledge.  All content area teachers use  backward planning working from the NYS Performance Assessment rubrics to plan instructional units. The NYS Performance  Assessment units are all Common Core aligned for all content areas.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      For more common languages, students on intake are administered paperwork in native language and are  interviewed.  Spanish speaking students are administered the Spanish Lab and our native language staff can give feedback on  projects and assessments. For languages where we do not have formal assessments in place, we rely on community partners,  peers and families for feedback throughout the year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE, like all other students in our school, are grouped heterogeneously in all grades.  In addition to receiving the services all of  other ELL students receive, SIFE are offered two additional 65-minute periods of literacy instruction per week.  SIFE receive   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      priority for all after school services such as Regents prep, tutoring, and Saturday academy.  Newcomers are provided with all  instructional services provided to all other students.  In addition, they receive all minutes of ESL instruction a week required by  NYS regulations.  Our school is organized around the needs of the students in a particular team.  As such, instruction is geared  toward providing for students’ individual needs in and outside of the classroom.  All students at our school, regardless of grade  or years in the United States, take the CC Algebra Regents exam at the end of the 10th grade, and must produce their Native  language Portfolio.  In 11th grade, they take the CC ELA Regents and produce and present portfolios is 2 Core content areas -  Math and Social Studies. In the 12th grade, students produce Portfolios in Science, English and a Personal Statement .  All  students are administered the NYSESLAT in the spring semester every year.   ELLs receiving service for four to six years and long-term ELLs, like all other students in our school, are grouped  heterogeneously in all grades.  In addition to receiving the services all of other ELL students receive, long-term ELLs are may be  offered two additional 65-minute periods of literacy instruction per week.  In addition, long-term ELLs receive priority for all  after school services such as Regents prep, tutoring, and Saturday academy.  In addition, all students receive small group  Portfolio Mentoring weekly.  The years after a student tests proficient based on the NYSESLAT scores,  teachers will, based on classroom assessments,  continue to provide the scaffolding and supports necessary to ensure the student's continued success. These students also are  provided with mentoring and internship opportunities.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   In addition to all services provided to all students and the additional services provided to struggling students, special needs  students are provided with any and all services required by the Individual Instructional Plan.The supports and strategies  include native language paraprofessional, assistive technology, and technology assisted educational programs and  direct  instruction. In addition, we provide literacy support in a supplemental period during the day.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs are provided a mulitservice model that aligns with their Individual Educational Plan.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All of our targeted intervention programs are geared towards supporting all of our ELL subgroups; teachers running these  programs implement the “Internationals Approach” in all of them:   •     French Heritage Language Program (in collaboration with the French Embassy in NYC) – this two-hour weekly program  supports native language literacy for our francophone (West African and Haitian) ELLs. This class is taught in French  •     Saturday Academy – For 10 Saturdays per semester faculty members provide a small group of students with three hours of  Engish instruction - Argumentative and Persuasive Essay writing.   •     After School Tutoring – All students can visit the tutoring center after school to get support for their content-area  academic writing from either a certified teacher and/or an English proficient peer.  This class is taught in English.  •     Regents Prep After School– Older ELLs who have not yet passed the CC Algebra or CC ELA Regents receive weekly Regents  preparation class taught in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year we will continue to expand the performance-based assessment system for all students. As a graduation requirement  all students will be required to prepare a Native Language, English, Science, Social Studies and Mathematics project, as well as  a Personal Statement.      In addition, in order to promote equity and access for ELL students to college level and technical education we will be offering  students a College Indexed course in Argumentative Writing and we will also offer STEM courses in computer science and  coding, Further, all science will be expanding its lab capacity via the use of state-of-the-art mobile STEM labs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs for ELLs will be discontinued.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Since more than 90% of our students are ELLs, all school programs are “equal access.” In addition to the support and  intervention services listed in the answer to question five of this section, we have the following after-school classes.  While  they may not all be “academic” in theme, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development through  activities incorporating listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English:   •     After School College and Scholarship Essay Writing   •     Chess Club  •     Science Club  •     Global Potential  •     Haitian Club   •     Newcomers Conversational Class                English Regents Preparation Class     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Since all teachers design their own project-based curricula, there are too many instructional materials to name individually; all  teachers draw from multiple sources in compiling classroom curricula and materials.  Some examples include:         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All students participate in our language development/ESL program.  All of our classes use the native language to support  learning.  As described above, the locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and  their native languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in  English and students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Students are  supported by peers, community partners, family members and/or school personnel.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to our students.  We use a wide array of resources in our  school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large  variety of non-text hands-on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the  Internet to access resources.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Each summer the campus schools coordinate to provide a joint program in offering courses for students including all ELLs to  recoup credits. In the school year. Also, sports extracurricular activities are campus-wide and ELL students participate with  native speakers on all PSAL teams - Soccer (boys and girls), Basketball (boys and girls), Swimming Team (Co-Ed), Baseball,  Softball, Badminton (girls), Track and Field (Coed), Cricket (boys), to name a few.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Every Summer new students are invited to a three day orientation program where they meet their new classmates, meet  teachers, buddy up with 10th, 11th, and 12th graders and engage in team-building activities and general orientation to the  school and the school community. In addition, prior to the start of the school year, new students are assigned to  heterogeneous teams with, as far as practicable, students who speak their native language.  The new students are then paired  with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get  home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and advocate in class.  In addition, incoming students  are assigned to 9th grade advisors, who have been trained to do a kinesthetic activities during the first several months in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         advisory in order to help students ease into the school program.  A lot of attention is paid to team building and using  scaffolding to help students open up about their feelings about school and their transition to a new country and a new  language. Students who enter throughout the year are assigned advisories and native language buddies and are placed in  classes with native language support.Paste response to question here:        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Francophone students are offered a French elective after school.  We are pursuing the same opportunities for the two other  major language groups represented in our school, Spanish and Chinese.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  See below for 1, 2 and 3.    See below for 1, 2 and 3.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  1. and 2 and 3. Professional development for all staff at The International High School at Prospect Heights is geared toward  improving ELL academic achievement and language development; we build teacher capacity in these areas by a variety of  means:      •     Weekly professional development meetings, which include the following activities:   o     Analysis of student work in order to improve instruction/design interventions  o     Analysis of student assessments (project-based learning)   o     Social-emotional progress of a teaching team’s shared students   o     Formation and refinement of discipline specific benchmarks at each grade level   o     Peer critiques of teacher-generated curricula     • Team Intervisitiations – teachers engage in a  where they meet for a pre-observation conference, observe each member of  their team, provide peer feedback, an debrief lessons.  The feedback is grounded in the International Approach and focused by  the network’s five core principles.     •     Participation in Internationals Network for Public Schools Professional Development workshops – at three different points  in the school year, our entire staff will meet with their peers from our sister International High Schools and attend workshops  designed specifically for educators of recent immigrant ELL students.  Topics include scaffolding instruction, differentiation of  instruction, ESL methodologies, SIFE students, meeting the affective needs of immigrant children, and language development.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         •     International High Schools intervisitations – in order to promote more intra-network dialogue, and sharing of best  practices and curriculum, groups of IHS teachers from across the network meet monthly at different IHSs across the city in  order to learn from their best practices.        •     QTEL/OELL trainings – Our classroom teachers are encouraged to complete workshops with QTEL and other OELL offerings,  which highlight best practices, like scaffolding and differentiation, for working with ELLs in the content areas.       •     Conferences – faculty attend a variety of external conferences each year in order to keep abreast of new trends in ESL and  their content areas.  - Teacher PD on Common Core instruction for ELLs is embedded in the work above  In addition,  NYS Consortium provides  professional development and material support in the development of Common Core aligned units and rubrics that are the  standard school-wide.  4. Since all staff members participate in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout the course  of the school year, everyone receives many more hours than the current 7.5 required annually.  All professional development  at our school is focused on ELL training since the majority of our students (and all of our newly admitted students) are  ELLs.  The professional development program described in #1 above provides multi-year, on-going professional development  for all members of the faculty.  Even if teachers participated only in the in-school professional development – the bare  minimum for our teachers – they would be participating in a minimum of 120 hours of professional development a year.  In  addition, our school participates in professional development organized by Internationals Network for Public Schools, including  intervisitations, summer and Election Day professional development, and a variety of inter-school project-based learning  opportunities.       The International HS @ Prospect Hts was designed to meet the needs of English Language Learners. As we admit only Entering,  Emerging or Transitioning ELLs, 100% of the school professional development is intended to provide training for teachers and  administrators on integrating language and content  instruction for English learners. All activities described in 1, 2, and 3 are  intended and designed for teachers of ELLs, both school-wide and network-wide.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Each teacher through our advisory program, is responsible for a cohort of no more than 18 students and families. Teacher  advisors do on-going outreach and meet with parents during their contractual Parent Engagement time.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  All activities are designed to foster involvement of ELL parents. The school-wide advisory programs provide each family with a  point of contact for all school communications and providing family information on the progress of the student. Each teacher  will be responsible for a cohort of no more than 18 students and families. Teachers conduct outreach and parent meeting  during their parent engagement time. In addition, in order to cater to the inflexible work schedules our parents have, all  parent conferences are conducted by appointment at a time that is convenient and determined by the parents.  Parent  teacher conference days begin as early as noon and continue until 8pm to accommodate their schedules. In addition, to assure  that parents can access information, even if they speak a low-incidence language, in-person interpreters are provided at each  parent conference date. In addition, there is a Translation Corps of students who assist parents with school surveys and access  to technology to monitor their students progress.   Further, each year we offer a series of workshops to address needs identified by parents and to educate parents on the high  school and college process. For example, this year, parents received trainings on Know Your Rights, and resources regarding  immigration.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nedda de Castro, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our parent/guardian community is nearly 100% new immigrants, representing at least 15 different languages. As  such, our parent/guardian community is not only supporting their children, who are also new immigrants, in  acquiring English and meeting high school graduation requirements; they are also carving out a new life for  themselves and their families in New York City, USA. Written and oral communication from the school to families  is a key resource for our parents/guardians and their children. The data and methodologies we use to assess their  language preferences, therefore, are comprehensive. In order to ensure our parent/guardian community's  language preferences are met, our Language Access Coordinator, in collaboration with our administration, our  guidance team (comprised of two social workers and a guidance counselor), and our students' advisors, utilizes  the following:   * Part 3 of the Home Language Identification Survey   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      * Intake interviews with families   * Student cumulative files   * ATS biographical reports   * Ongoing contact with parents/guardians regarding their children's academic and social/emotional progress         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     There is no other population.          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In case of an emergency, translated messages will be sent via school messenger, in addition to, leveraging  mulitiilingual staff to make calls to parents and families.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Our school consists of 100% ENL population, therefore, the focus of all parent engagement activities school-wide as  implemented by teachers, support staff and administration are designed to maximize ENL parent and family access.  The goal of Chancellor's Reg. A-663 is an explicit goal of our school in its mission and vision.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)   Because our school exists to serve recent immigrant students and their families, we are highly sensitive to the need to  provide comprehensive access to school communications and information for a variety of language groups.  Translation and interpretation are top priorities for all our school-to-family interactions. As such, our various teams,  including guidance, support staff, teacher teams, advisory teams, and administration, strive to meet the standards of  Chancellor's Regulation A-663 at all times.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We utilize the following mechanisms to gather feedback from parents:   * formal NYC DOE parent surveys   * regular Parent Association meetings   * regular School Leadership Team meetings   * phone trees conducted by Parent Coordinator and Parent Association leadership   * regular contact between advisors and parents regarding their children's academic and social/emotional progress        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68
