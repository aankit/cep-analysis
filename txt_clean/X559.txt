This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      We believe in teaching the “whole student” – without judgment – in a safe environment that supports their  academic, social and emotional development. Learning should be meaningful, purposeful, and challenging so that our  students are empowered to become life-long learners, who seek knowledge in all that they encounter. This is  achieved by offering new perspectives, experiences, and insights while celebrating the values, beliefs, and cultural  identities that our students bring with them.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The School of Tourism and Hospitality was opened as a new CTE school in the Jane Addams Campus in the 2012-13  school year. In 2017-18 the school served 312 students in grades 9-12. Enrollment for the 2018-19 school year is  projected to be 330 students. The student body includes 25% English Language Learners and 28% of students have an  individualized education plans. Girls account for 59% of the student population, and boys account for 41% of the  population. 85% of students are eligible to receive free or reduced lunch.   Our school has a number of collaborative/strategic partnerships and special initiatives. First, our school communicates  high expectations coupled with ongoing support through our AVID program. In their 9th grade year, all students are  introduced to the AVID program and WICOR strategies across all classroom. Second, our commitment to helping all  students be prepared for students college is evident in an expanding offering of AP classes through the AP for All  initiative. Three years ago, we did not offer any AP classes. With our partnership with AP for All we have expanded  that offering so that over the past two years, we will have offered 7 different AP courses that our juniors and seniors  can participate in. Third, through our crew system, each student meets with their crew leader on a daily basis, the  crew leaders help to ensure that students are meeting expectations at school and work with families to support  students. Fourth, through our CTE program students are prepared for the world of work through the use of internal  and external internships. Each intern is provided support on developing career readiness skills. Fifth, we collaborate  with AMS II, the charter school located in our campus through a Department of Education program. Sixth, our  teachers are actively engaged in action research through the Collaborative Action Research Project (CARP). Finally,  through a partnership with East Side House Settlement, students are offered additional social and emotional learning  support. This involves individualized support for specific students with exceptional need.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Many of our students have extraordinary needs. The student body includes 25% English Language Learners, 28% of  students have an individualized education plans, and 19% of students are in temporary housing.   Many of the new LEP students have recently arrived in the country and have very limited English proficiency. Because  the vast majority of these students do not speak or read English, it is necessary to adapt instruction to meet their  needs. While bilingual classes are not offered, most teachers utilize translation services to make content available to  students in their native language. Our school employs two full-time ENL teachers, which allows us to create small  groups for ENL instruction that is based on need. In addition ENL students receive additional support in the classroom  by these teachers.   Our school's largest department is our special education department, where we have 7 full-time teachers who  provide specially designed instruction to students in accordance with their IEP. Each special education teacher serves  as a crew leader for a small group of students with IEPs and serves as a primary point of contact for the family and  student. Students are placed on their crew based on the specific need of the students ensuring that the crew leader  develops the specific skills necessary to help their crew members succeed.   For students who do not have permanent housing, the school provides a variety of support services including food  and clothing. Again, students with these particular needs are placed in a crew together to ensure that the family has a  single contact person in the school who is able to provide support and serve as a reference.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Bright Spots   Rigorous Instruction   Over the past year the school made a number of improvements. First, we launched our AP for All program and added  two AP courses. More than 90% of students who were enrolled in these courses completed the course and sat for the  AP exam. Through the utilization of AP vertical teams, departments began the process of aligning instruction to  prepare students for AP exams.   Our school reorganized its course sequence to create opportunities for more 9th grade students to sit for Regents  exams. 9th graders sat for both the Algebra I regents and the Living Environment Regents. By completing these exams  in their first year, students are able to progress to more rigorous math and science courses.   Our CTE program expanded its use of internal and external internships. This allowed more students to graduate with a  Career Development and Occupational Studies credential with their diploma and helped prepare them for the world  of work after graduation.   Strong-Family and Community Ties   100% of parents reported on the NYC School Survey that they are greeted warmly when they enter the school.    100% of parents reported on the NYC School Survey that the principal is committed to shared leadership.   Areas of Need   Rigorous Instruction   According to teachers on the NYC School Survey, students struggle in the area of discussions. Particularly, 18% of  teachers responded positively to questions asking whether students build off of each others ideas and cite data from  sources.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X559   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   305   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  As always, we will continue to fill vacancies by seeking highly qualified teachers and putting applicants through a  rigorous interview and demo lesson process. Teachers are more likely to stay in an environment where they have  active input into the curriculum. We hope to develop partnerships with top education programs (Hunter, teacher's  College, Bank Street, TFA, etc.)     Develop Leadership/mentor program    o  Goals of Leadership/mentor program:      #1 – recruit and develop enthusiastic and dedicated teachers     #2 – develop the skill sets of existing teachers who desire to be teacher leaders     #3 – create a culture of mentees becoming mentors where teacher leaders seek to develop   others as they were developed once as mentees themselves    o  Structure of Leadership/mentor program:      Recruitment     At least 1 teacher will be identified and chosen to participate as a mentee each year.    The individual will be selected by the school’s leadership team based on an open  posting announcement, letter of interest submitted by applicant and an interview  with the team. Teachers already working at the school will be encouraged to apply.       Schedule     Mentees who are not existing teachers at the school will be interviewed. Once hired   (as with existing teachers) they will meet with their mentor and the  principal/designee once per week to set goals, develop actionable plans, chart  progress and conduct classroom visits/inter-visitation.     Mentees will also meet with colleagues to co-plan instruction:      With special education teacher – 85 minutes once per week     With English as a second language teacher – 85 minutes once per week      Participants     Mentors – principal, instructional coaches, existing teachers at the school with a track  record of instructional excellence and a desire to support the development of others    Mentees – teachers who are not yet a part of the school and teachers assigned by the   principal to be mentored as deemed appropriate based on observations and data  outcomes    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Outcomes         Desired outcome #1 – newly hired teachers will remain in their instructional roles for   at least 3 years (including their first year with the school)      Desired outcome #2 – existing teachers will become teacher leaders within 3 years of   first being mentored    Desired outcome #3 – at least 50% of the teachers who are mentored will become mentors themselves within 3 years  of first being mentored        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   High quality professional learning must enable to “teachers to work regularly together to improve their practice and  implement strategies to meet the needs of their students.” (Wei et al, 2010, p. ii) This applies as well for principals  and paraprofessionals. To that end, we implement the following professional learning activities over the coming year:           At a minimum, all teachers will be a part of a departmental team that regularly engages in an inquiry based   process that focuses on using student work to identify areas of need and that identifies evidence-based  practices that can be implemented to help students succeed.     Differentiated professional development will be provided to all teachers based on specific teacher created   goals. The goals will be created based on data and teacher reflection on his or her own practice.     Differentiated professional development will also be provided to all teachers who were rated developing or   ineffective on components 3b or 3d of the Framework for Teaching on a formal or informal observation.   The effectiveness of the professional learning will be monitored using multiple data sources, including but not limited  to ADVANCE data, Regents test results, common assessments, and teacher surveys.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     For the 2016-17, in addition to Regents examinations, the school will give three common assessments in math and  ELA. Each common assessment was selected with input from teachers to ensure that the assessment will provide  teachers with data that they need to make instructional decisions. All teachers in core subjects will use standards  based grading. The standards that will be measured for each teacher are identified in the curriculum used by the  school. The curriculum was created collaboratively with teachers using district provided curriculum as a starting point.      The data from these tests, analyzed in conjunction with Regents will be used by teachers to modify curriculum and to  identify specific students who are in need of remedial services. Remedial services will provided as part of the school’s  AIS plan.      SBG will allow the school to use an analysis of grades to identify students who are not meeting standards and who  need additional support.      Professional development will focus on student engaged assessment.      The data analysis from the common assessment and Regents results will be used to determine additional needs.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The School for Tourism and Hospitality, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The School for Tourism and Hospitality will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;              Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

On the ELA Regents, 11% of ELLs scored a 65 or higher.  Excluding ELLs, the school's pass  rate for the exam was 60.9%.  ELLs performed substantially lower than the whole school in  questions aligned to the following reading:  -    Anchor Standard 5: Analyzing the structure of the text and its development (-31%)  -     Anchor Standard 2:  Determine a central idea and its development (-24%)    2. On the Global History Regents, while the overall pass rate for the Global History Regents  exam was 19.5%, 0 ELLs passed the exam.  ELLs particularly struggled with writing the  DBQ essay.  35% of ELLs scored a 1 on this essay, which was twice as high as the  schoolwide average.    3.  There are 7 students in cohort S who are still receiving ENL services.  Of those students, 5  out of 7 students have earned at least 30 credits.  The two students who are behind on credits  have attendance rates less than 25%.  However, all of these students are off-track in terms of  exam status.  Similarly for Cohort T, there are 14 students who currently receive ENL services.  For those students, 11 of 14 have received 10 or more credits per year.  However, 10 of 14 are  off track in terms of progress on Regents exams.    Subgroups and Grade Levels to be Served    Program is designed to assist our ELLs in the language fluency that is necessary to understand  these concepts, and access the content heavy material. We offer Saturday Academy to our  Spanish-English bilingual students.  The academy will be offered in two sections; one to prepare  students for the January Regents and a second session to prepare students for the June  Regents.  The academy will meet a minimum of 20 Saturdays.  Each session will meet for a  minimum of 3 hours. from 9:00am to 12:00pm   The academy will be staffed by three  teachers.  Mr. Vela our ENL teacher, Ms. Gonzalez, a bilingual certified teacher, and Mr.  Manoatl a Spanish speaking social studies teacher.  The sections are as follows:    Section 1.  Entering and Emerging students will receive bilingual re-enforcement of concepts  taught during the week, with an emphasis on vocabulary development and informational  writing.  The goal of this section is to enhance their fluency and comprehension by using L1  (Spanish) as a support.  Materials will be in both English and Spanish.  This course will use Holt  McDougall's World History and the Spanish English Guided Reading Workbook.  Students will  be able to use an electronic translator to better comprehend longer passages where vocabulary  usage  is not typical.

(These materials will not be  purchased with Title III funds.)  This group is approximately 20 students. Teachers will use a  variety of instructional modalities during these sessions including direct instruction,  parallel teaching, and flexible grouping.    A parent academy will be also utilized to help build language support in families.  This academy  will be run for a minimum of 6 Saturdays or evenings throughout the course of the year.  Each  session will last 3 to 4 hours depending on the content The academy's topics will be determined  based on a parent survey which will be sent home to parents in November 2018.

In addition, an analysis of NYSESLAT testing data indicates that  there is a substantial gap between student performance on the speaking and writing portions of  the exam.  Students are able to speak English at a much higher level than they are able to write it.  There are three teachers who will be primarily involved in the administration of the  program.  The teachers are Abel Vela, Brenda Gonzalez, and Cristian Manoatl.  These teachers  will receive the following professional development:       1.

We do have a  growing and every year changing population of students from African countries, whose parents  speak low-frequency languages.  In order to better inform of the work that their children are  doing, especially as it relates to the Common Core, we are going to purchase ECTACO Partner  13MT900 Grand Multilingual Talking Electronic Dictionary and Audio PhraseBook, or a  similar program.  (Title III funds will not be used for this resource.)    This will provide for translation for parents into 183 languages, including many African  Languages.  With this translator, we will be able to send home class newsletters in the  appropriate languages and make full use of the parent notification tools available via online  gradebooks but providing indepth information in the appropriate languages.  This home-school  connection is vital when sharing with parents the news of their children's and triumphs.      In August we will hold a newcomer orientation for parents of students entering our Freshman  class.  The orientation will be conducted by Ms. Gavin (a bilingual certified teacher) and the  school's guidance counsellor (Ms. Ibrahim). During orientation, we introduced parents to the  credits accumulation process, Regents expectations, and the assistance their children will receive  in transitioning to high school as well as to post-secondary education/career.    In addition, because we have, for the first time, a junior class, this spring we will be offering a  College Application workshop for parents of ELLs and FELLs.  Parents who are recent  immigrants to the United States are unfamiliar with the process of applying to college and are  therefore, unable to provide timely, appropriate assitance to their children.  Our goal is to share  with the parents the timeline for visiting and applying to college as well as the steps  necessary.  This would include information about the applications, FAFSA, scholarships and  grants vs loans, and resources for students without documentation.  This workshop would be  presented by the guidance counselor, with another staff person for translation, as well as our  CBO's College and Career Readiness counselor.  Ideally, this would be followed up with  additional workshops in the fall if funds are granted.  Tentatively, on June 10th, we will have an orientation process for students who have been  matched with our school.  We will share the program that we have for ELL students, as well as  additional social-emotional supports.  This will be an opportunity for parents to learn about the  ways that we will work together to ensure their children's academic and social success in high  school and beyond.    Records will be maintained including agendas, attendance sheets and invitations in parents’  preferred languages by the facilitator of the program in an ENL binder.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50               Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Last year (2016-17) we utilized several assessments to assess the literacy skills of our ELLs.  These assessments included a  schoolwide literacy assessment, state test scores, and teacher-created assessments.  These assessments demonstrated that  entering and emerging students are reading far below grade level and that they need additional support in both reading and  writing.  Progress was monitored throughout the year.    This year (2017-18) in addition to the above assessments, we will use STAR 360 to assess reading levels and provide teachers  with appropriate recommendations based on the assessment data.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Our schoolwide assessment plan includes regularly scheduled common assessments.  The common assessments include a  general ELA assessment as well as ELL assessment specifically for ELLs who are Entering or Emerging.  The analysis of these  commons assessments are supported by our daily schedule which includes time everyday for teachers to meet around various  school needs including planning to meet the needs of ELLs based on assessment data.    Additionally, as part of schoolwide instructional focus on assessment,     Similarly, 15% of our professional learning opportunities are directly related to supporting English Language Learners.  These  activities include analysis of state test scores, common assessment results, and in class assessments.  In these professional  learning opportunities teachers learn to plan for the needs of ELLs.    Our ENL coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the assessments that are planned for the assessment calendar are carried  out.  Both ENL teachers work collaboratively with teachers around planning of lessons.    Finally, when conducting observations as part of the ADVANCE system teachers are given specific feedback related to planning  including using assessment data to plan for the needs of ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments that are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need include state exams (Regents and  NYSESLAT), common assessments, ELL Periodic assessments, and teacher made departmental and classroom assessments.    These assessments indicate that ELL students          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Following each state exam regents results of ELLs are analyzed as part of the schoolwide assessment.  A protocol is followed  for the assessment which includes setting specific schoolwide, departmental, and classroom goals.      In addition, our school uses Jump Rope as part of our standards based grading policy.  With this tool we are able to specifically  monitor the progress of goals based on standards aligned assessments.    Professional learning opportunities address the specific goals that are related to the data analysis.  The topics for  thiese PLOs are selected based on our ongoing data analysis and protocol.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our school analyzes both Regents exams and the NYSESLAT to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  Specifically the analysis  extends beyond score breakdown to include performance based on standards and identifying, when possible, areas where our  students are under-performing city averages.  This analysis is then used to modify programs to meet student need.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Analyses of Regents exams are created as part of professional learning so that teachers are involved in the analysis.  The  results are then shared with the staff as a whole and are referred to during other professional learning opportunities.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Through the use of the Progress to Graduation Tracker and individual transcript review the school closely monitors the  performance of students on individual basis.  Through this tracking programs are monitored and revised.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In our freestanding ENL program, students are programmed primarily in homogeneous groups for the the stand alone  classes without reference to grade level.  For integrated ENL services students are in heterogeneous groups primarily  by grade groups.  There is not intentional use of block programming.  However, given the limited number of course  offering, students of the same language proficiency and grade level are frequently in the same classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students at the entering level are programmed for two units of stand-alone ENL and are scheduled for one unit of integrated  ENL in an ELA class.  Students at the emerging level are scheduled for two .5 units of stand-alone ENL and one unit of  integrated ENL in an ELA class.  Students at the transitioning level are scheduled for .5 units of stand-alone ENL and a minimum  of one unit of integrated ENL in an ELA class.  Students at the expanding level are scheduled for a minimum of one unit in  integrated ENL in an ELA class.  Students who have tested commanding within the past two years are scheduled for a minimum  of 1 unit in integrated ENL in an ELA class.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All classes are taught in English.  Teachers in content areas use some translated materials or leveled reading materials to help  students access the content.  The students have access to translators and dictionaries.  In addition, the ENL teacher, along with  several other staff members, speak Spanish, which is the home language of all beginning and intermediate students, and  translate key words to assist students.  Teachers use images to create a context for the lessons.  Sentence starters and writing  prompts are used throughout the content areas.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Teachers are provided with resources to ensure that translated materials are available for students in their home language  when apporpriate.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE in high school are intellectually able to comprehend the assignments but have difficulty completing them because of  the gaps in their education. Because the teaching staff has common planning time, we are able to identify specific skills that  need reinforcement. As a part of the push-in service, the ENL teacher is able to work with small groups or individual students  to rectify these gaps and provide further instruction/scaffolding to fill in the holds. SIFE are also referred to after school  tutoring to further target and eliminate academic gaps.    b. Newcomer ELLS are placed in two hours of ENL daily, one hour of free-standing ENL and one hour of integrated ENL. They  take their content area classes together. During the ESL class, time is dedicated to working on content area vocabulary and  tasks. Content area teachers offer tiered assignments to allow newcomer ELLs the ability to acquire vocabulary and English  language skills, and demonstrate their knowledge of content. They use dictionaries, translators, and bilingual materials. They  are offered the option of taking mandated exams in English or in their native language. Each year they are given the NYSESLAT.    c. Developing ELLs who have received service for four to six years are placed in daily, hour long ENL classes or in Integrated ENL  classes, depending on their level.  Because of the size of our school, they often take classes together. Content area teachers  offer tiered assignments to allow ELLs the ability to aquire vocabulary and English language skills, and demonstrate their  knowledge of content. They use dictionaries, translators, and bilingual materials. They are offered the option of taking  mandated exams in English or in their native language. Each year they are given the NYSESLAT.    d. Long-term ELLs take daily hour long ELA classes. Because of the size of our school, they often take classes together with  other ELLs and have additional support through Integrated ENL. Content area teachers offer tiered assignments to allow ELLs  the ability to acquire vocabulary and English language skills, and demonstrate their knowledge of content. They use  dictionaries, translators, and bilingual materials. They are offered the option of taking mandated exams in English or in their  native language. Each year they are given the NYSESLAT.    e. Former ELLs receive Integrated ENL services and, because of the small size of our school, often take classes with current  ELLs.  Therefore, they benefit from the strategies used for the ELL’s across the content areas. Content area teachers offer  tiered assignments to allow ELLs the ability to acquire vocabulary and English language skills, and demonstrate their  knowledge of content. When the ENL teacher does push-in for current ELL’s she is also able to check in with the former ELLs.  They use dictionaries, translators, and bilingual materials. They are offered the option of taking mandated exams in English or  in their native language.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are placed in classes with both a SPED and content area teacher. They use visuals, graphic organizers, tiered texts,  pair-shares, and bilingual material to allow for multiple entry levels.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELLs with Special Needs are serviced by both the ENL and SPED teachers. They receive co-teaching with the SPED teacher and  content area teachers based upon the needs outlined in their IEPs. Depending on the requirements of their IEP, they may be  programmed for ENL. Regardless, all ELL-SWDs receive push-in ENL services in the content areas to support their learning.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Currently, newcomer ELLs have class time dedicated to developing the content area vocabulary that will allow them to succeed  in the content areas. In addition, the ESL teacher provides push-in support for ELLs and FELLs in accordance with the CR  154.  Students can attend after school tutoring as well as a Title III program, focused on supporting the linguistic skills  necessary for success in the History classroom.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      An analysis of our most recent Regents results found that of the 7 students who were at the expanding level, 0 student moved  to a commanding level.  Further analysis indicated that these students were not making progess in the area of speaking and  listening and, like all ELLs, were struggling with the writing portions of the exam.  As a consequence, the school will implement  and assess the academic conversations protocol that we introduced last year.  In addition, we have created a model classroom  that will focus on improving writing instruction.  Teachers will engage in a structured professional learning activity related to  supporting writers.    Given the increasing number of ELLs at our school, the school has also added a second ENL teacher.  This additional staff will  allow us to continue to offer small group settings.  Based on NYSESLAT and Regents anslysis, Regents prep opportunities will be  revised to provide specific support to ELLs in the area of wiriting.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are invited to join all after school activities and programs.  Activities (sports and clubs) are explained to students in the  home language if necessary, as are the expectations for joining that activity.  Supplemental programs such as Title III, Saturday  school,  and extra help are explained in the home language to the students and information about these programs is sent  home to parents in their preferred language.  Parents also receive phone calls regarding opportunities for this children.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All content area classes are taught in English. During staff wide common planning time, teachers are able to share strategies to  assist all ELLs. Using our NYSESLAT data, we can see that our students need greater support in the areas of reading and writing.  Across the school we are using Achieve 3000, which is available in English and Spanish, to build reading comprehension skills as  well as learn content area material. We are also implementing the Collin Writing Program to provide structured writing  development.  All classrooms are equipped with a projector, document reader, and have access to either iPads or laptops. This  allows teachers to present materials in a variety of ways including traditional texts, tiered texts, videos, quizzes, and games.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently, both ENL teachers are Spanish speaker, who works with students and teachers to help transition students between  the two languages.    There is no formal home language program at this time.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade level. Everything is tailored to the challenges  facing incoming Freshmen as they transition from middle school to high school or Sophomores  and Juniors as they continue to  accumulate credits and take Regents.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All content area classes are taught in English. During staff wide common planning time, teachers are able to share strategies to  assist all ELLs. Using our NYSESLAT data, we can see that our students need greater support in the areas of reading and writing.  Across the school we are using Achieve 3000, which is available in English and Spanish, to build reading comprehension skills as  well as learn content area material. We are also implementing the Collin Writing Program to provide structured writing  development.  All classrooms are equipped with a projector, document reader, and have access to either iPads or laptops. This  allows teachers to present materials in a variety of ways including traditional texts, tiered texts, videos, quizzes, and games.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Incoming freshmen are offered the oportunity to attend a Summer Bridge program.  Information regarding this program is  mailed to parents and phone calls are made in the parent's preferred language.  During Orientation, our CBO, Eastside House,  works with groups of students to help them meet other students and prepare for high school.  One group is offered by  Eastside's bilingual counselor, Ms. Vargas.  In addition, all freshmen and students who enter the school throughout the school  year are assigned a counselor through Eastside House.  Ms. Vargas works with all ELLs.  She also works with students weekly  during their Advisory period.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    American Sign Language and French were offered in 2016-17.  Spanish will be offered as a foreign language in 2017-18.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for ELL personnel is based upon the needs of the students.  DELLS routinely offers training  as do other groups associated with the DOE.  When an area of challenge becomes apparent, the ENL teacher looks for  opportunities to grow either through formal PD, online webinars, or through reading research and case studies.   In the past two years, ELL teachers have attended PD from the Bronx Field Support Center, QTEL, DELLS the Department of  Innovative Professional Development, Fordham University,  and Language Access Coordinators.  School wide, we have used the  Collins Writing Program to help all students.  We are currently reading Leaders of their Own Learning as the keystone text that  guides how we think about teaching students with various needs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All students, including ELLs are invited to New Student Orientation during the summer, as well as Summer Bridge. All freshmen  are assigned an advisor to help them transition to high school. ELLs who enroll throughout the year, regardless of their grade  level, will also be assigned an advisor to help them transition.    The ENL teacher routinely goes to professional development during the school.  Upon return, she uses the teachers'  professional development time to turnkey these strategies to other teachers.  For each professional development she attends,  she has an agenda and usually other materials.  These are used when providing turnkey PD to other staff members and are  maintained with the agendas and attendance for each meeting.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual Individualized meetings with parents of ELLs are held throughout the year during Parent Contact time.  If the parents  need to meet at a different time, meetings are set up during the school day.  Most of the parents speak Spanish, which the ENL  teacher speaks as well.  Whenever possible, on staff interpretation is used for other languages.  In the event that a parent  needs interpretation, we use the Interpretation hotline.  Many parents come in several times during the year to meet with the  ENL teacher regarding their child's language acquisition, strategies and activities to try at home, as well as their overall  academic progress.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The school has an open door policy. Parents are invited to visit at any time. They can reach teachers and staff via phone as  well. All student grades are provided to parents via Engradepro. The PTA is open to parents of ELLs.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Avis Terrell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   School of Tourism and Hospital                                                                              School DBN: 8x559  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are multiple methodologies to assess the language preferences of our parent community.      For students who are new to t      Each year we ask parents to complete emergency cards, which request the parents' preferred written and spoken  language. When students are enrolled, either as freshmen or new admits, we work directly with parents to  determine their preference.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         In addition, we access a variety of ATS reports that include home language and use those reports to plan for  communicating with parents.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Language ID Guide is currently at the security desk and in both secretaries offices. The Welcome Poster is located  at the entrance to our school. The Parents' Bill of Rights is distributed when students are admitted either as freshmen  or as new admits as is the Parents' Guide to Language Access.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator regularly communicate with parents about their needs and wishes for their  children. They are surveyed annually.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64
