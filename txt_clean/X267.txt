This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Bronx Latin School is a college preparatory school for students in grades 6 through 12. We offer a rigorous  program of arts and sciences and encourage serious scholarship, independent thought, and clarity of expression. We  work to inspire students to achieve their personal best through collaboration, inclusion, and goal-setting in a  supportive environment of high expectations. We believe every child has the right to an exemplary education. We  strive to empower our students to thrive in and graduate from college and positively impact their communities.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    A culture of high expectations and excellence permeates all classrooms, disciplines, and all grades. Bronx Latin is  rooted in a commitment to the community, and grounded in the love of learning. Bronx Latin had its first graduating  class in the spring of 2011. Bronx Latin is part of the New Visions for Public Schools and has many partnerships and  initiatives including becoming a part of the College Now program at Lehman College, Monroe College, hiring a full  time college counselor from the College Bound Initiative, and is participating in the Accessing Algebra through Inquiry  (a2i) program with the Silicon Valley Math Initiative. Bronx Latin has also partnered with New Visions to have teachers  participate in their CLASS (Collaborative Leadership to Advance School Success), and LP-UTR (Learning Partners-Urban  Teacher Residency) program in English and Special Education, and will be participating in the NYCDOE Learning  Partners program for the 2018- 2019 school year as the host school. Bronx Latin has been visited by former NYS  Education Commissioner John King, NYS Regents Chancellor Merryl Tisch, and NYC Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina  during the 2014-15 school year so that they could see the successes of Bronx Latin using data driven instruction to  improve academic success. In June of 2018, Bronx Latin had a graduation rate of 94%.      Our school employs 7 ENL teachers and 11 departmentalized Special Education teachers to ensure that our SWDs and  ELLs have access to curriculum. Teachers use data to ensure multiple access points for all Bronx Latin students.  Students are taught to use rubrics to assess their writing and presentations, and trained in protocols for peer  review/editing and discussion techniques. Use of Google Docs for writing enables students to seamlessly edit and  share their work with peers. Socratic Seminars (a minimum of 3 per year per teacher) and Exit Projects in Humanities  and STEM (grades 6-8) are examples of opportunities for students to expand their capacity to engage in rigorous  academic discussions      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The Bronx Latin school consists of a diverse student population, with many different learning needs. Our school serves  a population of students where approximately 30% are students with disabilities and 15% are English language  learners. This year, the prioritized school-wide instructional focus at Bronx Latin is college and career readiness. If you  read the Bronx Latin mission statement, you will notice that our key mission is to be a college preparatory school. The  last line of the statement says “We strive to empower our students to thrive in and graduate from college and  positively impact their communities.” The question for our students is not whether they will attend college, but how  to prepare for college and how to make the transition successful. In order for our students to thrive in college, we  have to scaffold the rigor in our instruction across all grade levels (6 - 12) and classrooms. Curriculum's across the  school will be designed to prepare students for college readiness by including frequent On Demand Writing tasks,  Performance Tasks, Socratic Seminars throughout the curriculum and scored using common criteria so that we are  able to calibrate academic expectations across courses and grade levels. As part of the focus on college readiness,  teachers in department teams will work on increasing the rigor of the writing tasks to advance higher level thinking,  with particular emphasis on feedback to students and their self monitoring of the learning process. In addition,  throughout all classes we will seek to instill key self-management skills to help students improve their study skills;  collect, organize, and retain factual information; take better notes; manage their time more effectively and efficiently;  work in teams; and reflect on the quality of their work. Implementation of our school’s goals across grades 6-12 leads  to coherence in instruction, and enables all teachers to work collaboratively toward ensuring the instructional shifts  are in place for all students, including ENLs and SWDs. The ENL and special education teachers collaborate with the  general education teachers to individualize instruction for the students.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Within the Framework for Great Schools our school has made the most progress with Strong Family and Community  Ties with an overall score of 4.34. Our highest scores were in the category included a 100% of parents/guardians  agreed or strongly agreed that teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs, 100% of teachers agreed  or strongly agreed that, at their school, school staff regularly communicate with parents/guardian about how   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      parents/guardians can help students learn, and 98% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school,  teachers work closely with families to meet students' needs. Within the Framework for Great Schools our key area of  focus is Rigorous Instruction in which our school had a score of 3.93. As part of our focus of increasing our score in  Rigorous Instruction, the school is continuing its focus on on-demand writing across curricula. Students will be writing  more, and increasing the amount of on demand writing with less scaffolding as the year progresses. Tasks will seek to  increase students use of academic vocabulary and use of evidence in their writing. Students should be writing on  demand tasks across curricula. The on-demand writing tasks will be incorporated into curriculum maps. These on- demand writing tasks will be completed every two weeks with a focus on academic vocabulary usage, and graded  using common grading criteria, with teachers collecting data and monitoring student progress. In addition to on- demand Writing, the school will also seek to increase the amount of Socratic seminar academic discourse happening  in the classrooms. The Socratic method is used to create a student-centered classroom. This requires careful,  thoughtful planning where teachers prepare questions and act as a facilitator rather than a lecturer in the classroom.  Eventually, the goal is that students will lead the discussion and will act as facilitators.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Within the Framework for Great Schools our key area of focus is Rigorous Instruction in which our school had a score  of 3.93. In order to address Rigorous Instruction, teachers have begun implementing regular formative assessments  and summative assessments embedded in curriculum maps as tools to drive their instruction.      Bronx Latin’s academic program combines the Common Core Learning Standards and New York State teaching  standards into their curricula. Teachers are responsible for following these standards and basing their curriculum  maps upon them. Teachers are constantly updating and refining the existing curriculum maps during weekly  department meetings to ensure that tasks are rigorous across the grades and that multiple access points are provided  for all students, including ELLs and SWDs, from the highest to lowest groups of students. All teachers at Bronx Latin  implement a minimum of 3 Socratic seminars in their classrooms, which combines student-led discussion with  rigorous texts and allows students to practice using text to support an argument or claim. Teachers also teach two  argumentative writing units and one informational writing unit that are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards.  Math teachers use performance tasks in their classrooms, both an initial performance task at the beginning of each  unit and a Final Performance Task at the end of each unit to measure student growth. Within the classroom context,  teachers are using multiple opportunities for formative assessments at a minimum of three per lesson to ensure that  students have grasped concepts taught at multiple times during the lesson. Bronx Latin has a partnership with College  Bound Initiative, CBI, to ensure that the majority of our graduates have assistance with the college process their  senior year. Bronx Latin offers five Advanced Placement Courses including AP English, AP Statistics, AP Spanish, AP  Environmental Science, and AP US History and has partnered with the department of education’s APEX expansion  initiative to ensure more success on AP exams. Bronx Latin also has a College Now partnership with Lehman College  where students have the opportunity to earn college credits while still enrolled at Bronx Latin. In addition to the  Socratic seminars, Bronx Latin is also known for it’s end of the year Exit Projects in grades 6 – 8 as students end of the  year learning culminates in an Exit Project in both the Humanities and Math/Science. We are also supported by  consultants from New Visions for our ELA and Math Departments and are participating in the Gates Grant as well as  the federally funded a2i and g2i projects in Algebra and Geometry. In addition to inside the classroom, students at  Bronx Latin have access to many Common Core aligned Internet resources including but not limited to www.ixl.com  (for MS and HS Math) , www.iready.com (for MS ELA), and www.castlelearning.com (for MS Test and HS Regents  preparation). As a means to increase literacy and social awareness, students now have access to www.newsela.com  (Advisory Curriculum) where teachers can assign quizzes, check reading progress, and tailor reading assignments to  individual lexile levels.   Priority needs for Bronx Latin this year include teachers redesigning and revamping curriculum maps, including  turning them into “live” documents with links to the tasks and formative assessments included, and more UBD and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      backwards planning in designing the maps. Goals also are similar to last years including to continue the focus on on- demand writing and accountable math talk. By focusing on this we will continue increasing students’ abilities to  perform well with regards to college and career readiness. This includes writing from sources and increased use of  academic vocabulary. These goals are data driven. They were selected based on an assessment of student outcome  data on summative NYS assessments and our continual review of student work during weekly teacher grade and  department team meetings/lesson studies. The on demand writing focus will target Bronx Latin need areas –  especially with our students who struggle with writing on the NYS assessments including the 6 – 8 grade ELA  assessments and in high school with our students who are struggling on the Global, US History, and English Regents  exams. Teachers will also choose focus students throughout the year which will include two general education, two  SWDs, and two ELLs for their weekly inquiry work in team meetings in order to track and assess progress being made  towards goals. In order to ensure that teachers are implementing rigorous instruction with the focus of assessment as  a tool for planning, teachers will continue to discuss lessons ideas, modifications, and opportunities to assess in the  lesson during grade team and department meetings. The leadership team will use their ongoing meetings to suggest  and align assessments to ensure that all grades and content areas have a specific focus for each marking period as  they look at data.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, through rigorous Instruction, Bronx Latin will increase the number of students in grades 6-8 receiving 2s  and 3s on NYS assessments to 80% and increase the number of students who pass the Common Core Algebra and  Common Core English with college ready scores by 3-5%.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      In order to increase the proficiency on the middle school  Mathematics and ELA exams and on the high school Regents  exams, we will continue to implement our school wide  instructional focus of more On Demand Writing in the  classroom and increased Accountable Math Talk in order to  increase rigor in the classrooms. We will also implement  Saturday Academy, after school tutoring programs, and provide  professional development for teachers in order to ensure  success. Attendance incentives will be in place to increase  Saturday Academy attendance. In addition Bronx Latin middle  school teachers are working with a New Visions Instructional  Specialist to implement more literacy routines into the middle  school classrooms, and guided reading groups are being  implemented in middle school ELA classrooms. Money has been  allocated to purchase books for guided reading implementation.    To address the needs of students with disabilities and English  language learners, the school has increased the number of  Special Education and ENL teachers in order to ensure these  students are better supported in the classroom and have access  to the more rigorous instruction. The school has 7 ENL teachers,  with 3 in the middle school and 4 in the high school. These  teachers will be pushing into the content areas of ELA and Math  in the middle school, and the Regents courses in the high school  to increase student success. Bronx Latin has also  departmentalized it’s Special Education department, with  teachers that specialize in certain areas co-teaching in those  content specialties and currently has 4 special education  teachers in the middle school, 4 in the high school, and 1 who  acts as IEP coordinator. Through weekly meetings, the teachers  gather to assess student success in the classroom and evaluate  how to ensure the most progress with these target groups of  students. The ENL Teachers and Special Education Teachers will  deliver professional development around best practices for  instructing and supporting ENL students and SWDs in the  classroom. The ENL and Special Education Teachers will deliver  Lesson studies within the Professional Learning Communities  (Grade Team and Department meetings) to model best  practices in ELL and Special Education instruction.

To increase parental  involvement Teacher representatives will meet with the  President of the Parent Association and Parent Representatives  during monthly School Leadership Team meetings to discuss  student progress and ongoing academic interventions for  students. Bronx Latin’s DC37 Family Worker will conduct weekly  phone calls to parents of students who are involved in after  school interventions, Saturday Academy and tutoring to provide  information and updates on the schedules for programs. The  Bronx Latin School website will be translatable into Spanish and  updated frequently with news and schedules of upcoming  academic interventions and links for contacting Teachers and  Administrators for families. Open school nights will be hosted at  Bronx Latin several times per year in order to encourage Parent  visits and community partnerships. During Parent Teacher  Conferences, parents will receive assistance in setting up  accounts to access Pupil Path (Online Gradebook) where they  can monitor student progress in classes, credit accumulation,  Regents examination scores, and communicate with teachers  about student progress. Parents will also be able to  communicate with teachers using the Kinvolved texting  platform as well.    With the goal to increase rigorous instruction comes increased  student success, and with administrators, teachers, parents, and  students working together towards this goal, trust will be a key  element. Because of the success of Bronx Latin, this trust is  already in place and is a key in the knowledge that everyone is  working together for the same goal – the success of Bronx  Latin’s students.   6 – 12 th grade  students,  parents,  teachers, and  administrators   Parent leaders,  Bronx Latin  administration,  teachers and  teacher leaders, and  all Bronx Latin  students   Year round  from  September  2018  through the  end of  summer  school in  August 2019          3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Bronx Latin prides itself on providing a supportive environment for its students. Students and parents are given a copy  of the School Handbook each fall in English or a translated version available in Spanish. Expectations are clearly  articulated during the 6 th grade and 9 th grade orientations in the fall. These tenets are further reinforced verbally  during grade level Town Hall meetings, daily student advisory classes for all students in all grades, during  Parent/Teacher Meetings and in regularly mailed parent correspondence. Each student is assigned an advisor, a  teacher who will serve as a point person, advocate, and first line of contact throughout the school year. The advisory  framework has successfully supported students by providing personal attention and support. During the 2018-2019  school year, the advisory program will continue to support the social and emotional growth of students with the  School Connect Advisory curriculum and use of www.newsela.com to address current events students are interested  in and affect them most. The advisory program at Bronx Latin culminates in an Outward Bound trip which is funded by  Bronx Latin. Outward Bound’s expeditionary learning approach is an educational framework that emphasizes high  achievement through active learning, character development and teamwork – across diverse learning environments.   All teachers are expected to call parents regularly and maintain phone logs with a goal of a minimum of 30 phone calls  to be made every month and bring parents of students into weekly grade team meetings. Teachersare also expected  to reach out to parents using the Kinvolved web application. To quantify, monitor and increase the rate of parent  outreach, the Bronx Latin school has created outreach targets for all teachers, in all grade levels, and utilized Google  Apps for Education's forms to record and compute parent outreach totals, reasons for contact and next steps. Fluid  and frequent communication between home and school has strengthened the parent and school’s working  relationship in support of each child. Students are taught rigorous curriculum and provided with a range of  accelerated courses such as AP and College Now courses that challenge their intellect as well as place them on the  path to high school success and college readiness. Bronx Latin has also contracted the College Bound Initiative (CBI)  for the fourth year in a row for 2018-2019 school year to further student college exposure and strengthen the existing  college application process at Bronx Latin. In October 2017 Bronx Latin and CBI will host a college fair with over 50  colleges in attendance. A full-time Director of College Counseling is assigned to the school to shepherd and monitor  students through the college selection/application process (including, but not limited to: SAT registration,  CUNY/SUNY/Private college application process, Financial Aid/FAFSA completion, college exposure through multiple  trips and an on-site College Fair, and college awareness seminars for students in grades 6 - 11).       The Family Worker makes home visits when students are not regularly attending and, as the student population has  expanded over the past four years, the team of licensed Guidance Counselors has grown.

One area that the school needs continued improvement in according to the school environment survey is supportive  environment with respect to students following the rules in class (58%), students listening to directions (58%), and  students behaving well when the teacher is not watching (45%). Students will receive support from their advisors and  peers in learning better executive functioning skills and understanding the importance of positive classroom behavior  as a vehicle for academic success. In addition, in 2018-19 Bronx Latin will have implemented a peer mentoring  program between middle school and high school students focused on attendance, academics, and behavior. In the  first year the program was a success, and thus, in the 2018-19 school year Bronx Latin will seek to gather more data  about the effectiveness of the mentoring program by tracking the data of the students who participate. Bronx Latin's  mentorship program will also join up with a West Point Leadership Corps, and partnership with West Point through  the Hayden Foundation with a focus on mentoring and building leaders. Bronx Latin will continue to use students as  to support one another across grades through peer mentoring and mediation.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Within the Framework for Great Schools School Quality Guide for the 2017-18 school year, Collaborative Teachers  was an area of strength with a score of 3.97.    The Common Core adoption at the middle and high school level as well as the new teacher evaluation system has  created the impetus for additional measures to strengthen teacher practice and support teacher collaboration. At the  heart of teacher growth is organic and sustained collaboration and inquiry related to teacher practice. Therefore,  teacher growth will be supported through a combination of weekly grade team meetings, weekly department  meetings, on-going teacher intervisitation and debriefing, common planning periods, lesson studies within  department meetings, collaborative team teaching classes with paired ENL and general education teachers as well as  special education and general education teachers. In order to monitor the implementation of these methods, the  Google Apps for Education will be used to create a principals dashboard will need to serve as a repository of meeting  minutes, low-inference observations and statistical data. Google Apps for Education has been integrated school wide  also introduced to provide necessary resources for online student collaboration as well as remote and in person co- planning in the Google drive. The principal’s dashboard was introduced to collect relevant data on existing systems for  teacher collaboration and promote teacher growth and development in line with 21 st century needs.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  Bronx Latin will encourage teacher collaboration by providing school-wide professional development to staff in which  teachers will meet by grade and/or department in order to perform lesson study and inquiry. We will also offer  expanded professional development specifically for new teachers in order to aid in their understanding of the Bronx  Latin school culture and overall growth in pedagogy and increase the number of teachers rated effective or highly  effective by 10% by June 2019 with a focus on increasing student credit accumulation by 5% for each of our 2020-22  cohorts.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

According to the Framework for Great Schools School Quality Guide report for 2018, Effective School Leadership is has  an overall rating of a 3.61   The principal and assistant principal articulate a strong instructional focus for the staff, and have an extra three days  of PD before the school year starts so that the staff has a cohesive vision of Bronx Latin’s goals before the school year  starts. The principal also has a distributive leadership structure in the school, and conducts leadership meetings every  other Monday after grade team meetings where the schools leaders come together. Structures/opportunities to  distribute leadership to teachers abound. For the 2018-2019 the following leadership roles are in place: a Dean of  Academics, seven Grade Team Leaders, and nine Department Leaders (includes Special Education and ENL team  leaders). Teacher leaders are expected to facilitate each weekly meeting, maintain agendas and minutes, and follow- up on the next steps determined by each team. Teacher leaders meet regularly with the Principal. There are also two  separate testing coordinators, one of the high school and one for the middle school. The principal will provide  ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers based on classroom observations. New teachers are  given additional PD and coaching. Guidance counselors and coaches do additional observations of new teachers to  provide them with actionable feedback. All Bronx Latin teachers will participate in inter-visitations and lesson studies,  monitored by leadership, to promote growth and a supportive environment for collaboration.    The priority need for the school can be seen in the school survey results in that only 60% of teachers believe  curriculum, instruction, and learning materials are well coordinated across grade levels and that 36% of teachers do  believe they have time to plan with the principal or assistant principal. This need has been improved upon during the  2018-19 school year and will continue to grow as the UFT contract leaves more time for teachers to meet every week  in both grade team meetings and department meetings.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, we will provide substantial opportunity for professional development in team and department meetings  which will result in a 15% increase in the percent of teachers who will agree or strongly agree that curriculum,  instruction, and learning materials are well coordinated across grade levels as measured by the results of the 2019 NYC  School Survey.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and the community in our school. Therefore, our school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 1, Part A  f the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. In  order to foster a more effective and inclusive school program, all stakeholders, particularly parents must be provided  with varied points of access for communication with the school leaders and faculty. In order to facilitate fluid and  continuous communication with parents, and increase parent involvement in school culture and management, the  Bronx Latin school will create and update the school website complete with email links to all staff members, a twitter  handle for social media contact, and use of the text messaging application Kinvolved to communicate with parents.  This increase in the range of communication mechanisms with parent is expected to increase the number of parents  monitoring student progress and attending parent teacher conferences and grade team meetings. Presently, the  Bronx Latin school utilizes advisers as point persons for parent contact, often with advisers looping with students to  ensure continuity of the relationship between parents and the school. Advisers are required to make weekly calls to  families to inform them of school related activities and complete phone logs using Google Apps for Education.  Advisers also serve as liaisons between families and the school. Bilingual advisers (Spanish) are assigned to students  from families who speak languages other than English. The school also employs Datacation and Skedula/ Pupil Path to  provide parents with direct access to student real time progress data, test scores and online access to teachers within  the school.    The success of the parent outreach framework is evident in the Framework for Great Schools Report, however it is an  area where the school is looking for continued growth, and continued parent enrollment in online platforms like  PupilPath. Our goal for the 2018-19 school year is to have at least 60% of parents at Bronx Latin enrolled on Pupil Path  to regularly check student grades. Bronx Latin will also continue to implement Kinvolved with a goal to have  correspondence with 80% of families a minimum of 6 times during the school year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, we will increase the amount of parent outreach and involvement in academic achievement as measured  by a minimum of 70% of parents accessing the Pupil Portal (Datacation) to monitor student progress and to improve  student attendance and credit accumulation.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  For retention, Bronx Latin implements distributive leadership, where all members feel they are important members of  the school community and weigh in on important decision making. Leadership positions, such as grade team leader,  teacher leader, and department leader, were created in an effort to retain highly qualified teachers. Teachers will be  given a survey in February 2018 to let the principal know their Declaration of Intent, and whether or not they plan to  stay. The principal will meet with teachers one on one to discuss their decisions. Bronx Latin works collaboratively  with the Human Resources Department with New Visions (PSO) to make new hires each year. New Visions holds  various job fairs where highly qualified teachers are screened and recruited to interview with their schools. Also, our  school works collaboratively with the New York City Teaching Fellows to recruit and hire highly qualified teachers in  hard to staff content areas such as math, science, and special education. A hiring committee, which consists of three  teachers and an administrator, reviews resumes, schedules demo lessons, observes demo lessons conducted by the  candidates, and conducts interviews. Each candidate is rated by each member of the hiring committee.   Teachers attend a week of professional development sessions in August, before the school year begins. In addition,  teachers attend several sessions of professional development throughout the school year, including topics such as  Socratic Seminar (6 hours), Argumentative Writing (5 hours), Performance Tasks (10 hours), Danielson Rubric (5  hours), MOSL (2 hours), and Teacher Best Practices (5 hours). Teachers also attend professional development held by  New Visions and New York City Department of Education. Teachers participate in professional development in their  weekly grade team meetings as well when they participate in lesson studies.    Our English and math teachers are part of the Gates Grant through New Visions (PSO), which provides them with  additional professional development and support within their classrooms. The math department is observed weekly  by Sarah Toguchi from New Visions (PSO) and then meets twice a month in department meetings for additional  professional development and lesson studies. Our English department is supported by Caroline Suh from New Visions  via observations and bi-monthly department meetings.   At the beginning of the school year, teachers set three professional goals for themselves. One goal is based on the  Danielson rubric, one goal is based on the Common Core Learning Standards, and lastly, one goal is based on data  from state exam pass rates or course pass rates depending on the course(s). Teachers then reflect on their progress  towards these goals three times throughout the year. The Danielson and Common Core Learning Standards goals  guide their lesson studies and teacher inter-visitations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38         Teachers are observed by peer teachers once a month and required to observe a peer teacher once a month as well.  Teacher leaders conduct observations based on domains 2 and 3. The guidance counselors conduct observations on  domains 2b and 2d as well. All of these observations are recorded through an online observation tracker that provides  instantaneous feedback to teachers and submits the reports to the principal as well so that she is able to see the  feedback as well.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Teachers attend a week of professional development sessions in August, before the school year begins. In addition,  teachers attend several sessions of professional development throughout the school year, including topics such as  Socratic Seminar (6 hours), Argumentative Writing (5 hours), Performance Tasks (10 hours), Danielson Rubric (5  hours), MOSL (2 hours), and Teacher Best Practices (5 hours).

English and Math teachers are part of the Gates Grant through New Visions (PSO) which provides the math and  English teachers with additional professional development and support within their classrooms. The math department  is observed weekly by Sarah Toguchi from New Visions (PSO) and then meet twice a month in department meetings  for additional professional development and lesson studies. The math departments is also supported by Sophie  Knowles from New Visions, who works specifically with the middle school math teachers. Our English department is  supported by Caroline Suh from New Visions.      Teachers are observed by peer teachers once a month and required to observe a peer teacher once a month as well.  Teacher leaders conduct observations based on domains 2 and 3. The guidance counselors conduct observations on  domains 2b and 2d as well. All of these observations are recorded through an online observation tracker that provides  instantaneous feedback to teachers and submits the reports to the principal as well so that she is able to see the  feedback as well.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community members in the school. Bronx Latin, in compliance with Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Bronx Latin will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement levels,  e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and making  decisions in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format and in a  language that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing professional development opportunities to school staff to improve outreach, communication skills, and  cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between school staff, parents, and other members of the school  community      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was based on a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians,  including parents/guardians of ELLs and SWDs. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the  content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the  school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to  more effectively meet the needs of parents and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be  maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title  I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s  Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, assessment expectations, literacy, accessing community and support services, and technology  training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Bronx Latin, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that the SPC outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share responsibility for improved  academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all  children achieve mastery on state assessments.

Bronx Latin currently has an ELL population of  approximately 80 students, 15% of the school population. These ELLs range across all grade  levels (6-12) and proficiencies (Entering-Commanding). Additionally, programming is designed  to match the regulated service hours for Former ELLs still in the Bronx Latin population, a total  of an additional 30 students. These proficiency levels are based on NYSESLAT results for the  2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years. ELL students at Bronx Latin are primarily L1 Spanish  speakers but also include a number of Fulani, French, and Arabic speakers, as well as speakers of  numerous other languages. Teachers work collaboratively in order to implement the strategies  necessary for student success. Incoming students who are new to the country will receive after- school tutoring from 2:35 to 3:45, a total of 24 sessions, on Wednesdays from October to  May.  The ESL teacher will be the sole instructor during these sessions.  Long term and at-risk  ELLS will attend Saturday Academy from 9 am to 1 pm to receive particular attention in  language deficiencies related to Regents/Middle school state exam level material.  There will be  20 total sessions, running from December to January, and then again from April to  June.  ELLs will attend these sessions with at-risk non-ELLs and be co-taught by content  teachers under the supervision of an ESL teacher.  Students will be divided into 3 or 4 groups of  15 to 20, with 1 certified ESL teacher and 1 certified content teacher.  Teaching will be done in a  manner of different styles, including team teaching and parallel teaching.  On occasion,  ELLs will be pulled out of these sessions by the ESL teacher to be given literacy instruction  based on specific needs.  These groups will be limited to 5 to 7 ELLs.  All instruction will be  delivered in English. The focus of the after school tutoring and Saturday academy for ELLs is  language acquisition through content which is delivered through strategies such as previewing  the text, pre-teaching vocabulary, and providing additional resources such as handouts that foster  content through visual aids, sentence starters, and modeled writing. The focus of these programs  at Bronx Latin is to develop ELLs' reading and writing skills and ultimately teach these students  how to write academic essays and formulate an argument both orally and in writing. To ensure  that these students receive these supplementary services,  there are 3 TESOL certified teachers  who service the middle school and 4 for the high school, respectively. Materials used include  NYSESLAT test prep books,  bilingual dictionaries and  visual aids. The instructional focus of  the programs mentioned above is as follows: students are able to improve their reading levels by  reading differentiated texts that are aligned to their individual reading levels. The students'  reading levels are determined by a diagnostic that provides teachers with students' individual  Lexile levels. Based on the data gathered, ESL teachers are able to create writing units which  require students to be able to cite evidence and form arguments (CCLS requirement). The  NYSESLAT test preparation books are used to improve students' abilities to listen, read, speak  and write in English. Teachers use these books as a resource to enhance English comprehension  and to prepare students for the NYSESLAT. Finally, the ESL teachers modify their instruction in  order to ensure that students who are speakers of other languages acquire the skills necessary to  be college and career ready. This is achieved by providing additional resources such as visuals,  translations, differentiated texts, manipulatives, videos and technology.

Parents will be notified of their child's mandated attendance requirement in a take-home letter in  both English and the child's home language. Attendance is tracked on a Google Form shared  across the school. Throughout the school year, ELLs will also be utilizing online programs such  as Castle learning, duoLingo, and IXL to supplement classroom instruction for high  achievement in Math, English, L1 and other core academic areas.  ELL students will also be  participating in specific field trips to help them build cultural bridges between each other and  also develop a better understanding of the pluralism that is American society.  Possible  destinations include: Ellis Island, The LES Tenement Museum, The Merchant's House and the  NY Historical Society.  Title III funding will be used to pay only the ESL certified teachers in  these programs.   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               The rationale for ongoing ESL Professional Development is to provide content teachers with  methods, strategies, and background knowledge to better serve ELL students, particular in  classes in which an ESL co-teacher is not present. Professional development is provided to all  ESL, general education and special education teachers that will participate in the Title III  programs in order to implement strategies that will facilitate these particular students' learning.  At the beginning of the school year (8/27/2018-8/31/2018) (one week prior to the official start  date of school), teachers will receive professional development that focuses on various strategies  that target ELLs. On the second day of professional development (8/28/2018), the ESL teachers  will deliver instruction on topics which include how to implement scaffolding strategies, leveled  texts, and SIOP planning. This will be done from 9am-12pm. On the third day of professional  development (8/29/2018), the ELA and ESL teachers will  jointly deliver instruction focused on  how to implement higher level thinking and questioning into lessons, and how to construct  argumentative and informational writing units. This session will take place from 12:30-2:30. On  the last day of professional development in September (9/4/2018), the entire staff will gather in  department meetings and implement the strategies described above into their own units and  lesson plans as the ESL teachers circulated and provided feedback to ensure that all ELLs would  be serviced according to their needs and levels. In addition on 11/6/2018, the ESL teachers will  administer a Professional Development on Differentiation to provide further guidance on  planning instruction for diverse classrooms.  Participants of the PDs will sign-in and all  documents, including attendance sheets and agendas, will be filed and kept on record in the  school building.  In addition, ESL teachers will visit, bi-weekly, the department meetings during  Tuesday after school PD.  During these visits, ESL teachers will participate in lesson plan studies  and cycles of inquiry presented by content teachers. The ESL teachers will assist content  teachers in implementing previously discussed ELL strategies and provide actionable feedback  to aid in supporting ELLs in the classroom. The ESL teachers are Matthew De Leo, Nancy Lu,  Diane Yacenda, Amy Hu, Amanda Rinzel, Jared Wood and Taina Benjamin.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               At the Bronx Latin School, parent outreach is an integral part of the school's model and  mission. When a new student is admitted, the ESL teachers conduct an interview with the student  and parent(s) to better understand their background and language needs. At the beginning of the  school year, an informational session will be held after school from 3:30 to 4:30 pm to discuss  the ESL Program option offered at Bronx Latin. This session will be held by the ESL  Department in both Spanish and English; in addition, supplementary materials will be provided  in both languages. Speakers of low-incidence languages will be welcomed by students who  are able to translate if necessary (Bengali,  French). As the months progress, parents are invited  to attend team meetings to discuss their child's progress. In addition, the child's academic adviser  reaches out on a biweekly basis to update the parents with their child's academic achievement  and personal development. Every child has an academic adviser who serves as a liaison between  the student, the teachers, and the parent.  Upon parent request or teacher recommendation  meetings will be scheduled between ESL teachers, parents, and relevant content teachers to  discuss challenges or progress made by students in their language learning. The meetings will  take place after school and be conducted in the presence of a translator fluent in the parent's  home language. Parents will be notified of these meetings by written letter, both in English and  the preferred language.  The community outreach liaison, Iris Rosso, will also make phone calls  to the parents whose home language is Spanish.  Parents will also be encouraged to reach out to  the school's ENL team at any time, and for any reason.  Meetings will be facilitated by ENL  certified teachers; Matthew De Leo, Nancy Lu, Diane Yacenda, Amy Hu, Amanda Rinzel, Jared  Wood and Taina Benjamin. .  All communications, both in English and parents' home language,  along with attendance sheets and agendas will be filed and kept on record in the school  building.   The ENL team will also provide tools and resources to the parents of ELLs that can  allow them to play a more integral role in their children's progress.  These resources may include  direct instruction on how to read and understand their child's report card and progress reports,  assistance on how to conduct effective parent-teacher conferences, and demonstrations on how to  access the technology that the school uses to monitor student progress.  These resources will be  provided right before or soon after each of the three parent-teacher conferences during the school  year. The dates of the conferences are approximately: Nov 29, March 7, and April 9.  Bronx  Latin will also offer college readiness seminars for ELLs and their parents. These seminars will  be focused on the college selection process, completing applications, FAFSA support, etc. ; a  seminar will also be held for MS students and parents for help with HS selection. The middle  school ESL teachers will also host occasional cultural events in which ELLs will present their  families with work related to the learning they have been doing in school, including  performances and showcases. These events and seminars will take place on various dates in  winter and spring 2019. Again, all communications, both in English and parents' home language,  along with attendance sheets and agendas will be filed and kept on record in the school building.  Refreshments will be served at all of these events.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P1.  For ELLs who have early literacy skills, the ENL teachers administer a practice NYSESLAT to test the ELLs' reading, speaking,  writing and listening levels. The teachers use rubrics from the NYSESLAT to determine whether the students' level falls under  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding or Commanding. They analyze this data in conjunction with the NYSESLAT data  and data from New York State Standardized exams. This data is used to drive instruction across the grade levels.  The data  reveals that most of the ELLs continue to need support in reading comprehension and writing.  The areas of speaking and  listening tend to be stronger.  Data continues to show that ELLs are struggling with reading comprehension skills such as:  determining central ideas and themes of a text, interpreting words and phrases as they are used in a text, and comparing and  contrasting how different authors deal with similar topics or themes in texts.  In addition, data shows that ELLs are struggling  with writing skills such as: developing a topic with relevant facts and examples, using appropriate and varied transitions to  create a cohesive piece of writing, and using precise vocabulary that is specific to inform about ot explain a topic. The data  reveals that on Regents exams, students struggle with high level vocabulary.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   N/A     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The school determines the success of the ELLs based on their ability to achieve proficiency levels on standardized exams,  authentic assessments, and pass/fail rates in their classes. In the 6  th  ,  7th and 8th grade 100% of ELLs were promoted. 100%  of ELLs in grades 9-12 were promoted. This data demonstrates the progress that ELLs are experiencing in our school  community.                 4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    N/A     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The 2016 NYSESLAT proficiency results revealed that only 2.5% of ELLs in our community were classified as Entering, 3.9%  were Emerging, 36.3% were Transitioning, and 57.3% were Expanding.The NYSITELL was administered to three new student,  and one classified as an Entering Level learner. This data reveals that applying differentiation strategies in the classroom  is  necessary to reach the broad needs of ELLs as well as non ELLs in the classroom.  The diverse levels of language learners in the  classroom has facilitated a process by which teachers are designing different activities and assessments to help learners access  information and apply skills in their classes.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   N/A            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      1.  a.  The organizational models utilized to deliver instruction to ELLs is a combination of Pull-out and Push-in ESL.  There are four ENL  teachers.  The middle school ENL teachers pull students out to deliver ENL classes in  homogeneous groups and also push in with the English and Math teacher in a heterogeneous setting to provide extra  support to the ELLs in the class.  The high school ENL teachers do the same, but also push into science, math, english  and history blocks to provide literacy support for the ELLs.          b.  ELLs are mixed in with non ELLs in their classes.  However, for the most part, ELLs are grouped together in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         same class in a grade so that the ENL teacher can pull them out at the same time and provide Push-in services at the  same time.  Since Bronx Latin is a middle school and high school,  3 ENL teachers provide service to ELLs in the High  School and two in the Middle School. Heterogeneous grouping requires that the ENL teachers differentiate their  instruction and collaborate with the teachers who they are pushing in with in this process.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 The school used the Charts below to program ENL teachers to meet the mandated minutes for each ENL student.  Entering and Emerging ELLs are provided with stand-alone instruction 180 minutes per week.  Transitioning ELLs are given one  unit of 180 minutes of integrated instructional time per week with half a unit of study (90 minutes) in a core content area and  an additional unit of study (90  minutes) in a separate content area. Expanding ELLs receive one unit of study per week totaling  180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction in a core content area. Commanding ELLs receive integrated services for an  additional two years with half a unit of study totaling 90 minutes in a core content area.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         The content areas are delivered in English.  In the specified content areas, the ENL teachers pushes in with the content area  specialist.  All content area teachers utilize the workshop model and implement differentiated instructional strategies with  their classes. In light of the new Common Core Learning Standards, content area teachers are also applying comprehension  strategies in their classes to augment their students reading skills.  Content area teachers will be focusing on monitoring  comprehension by activating and connecting students’ prior knowledge to what they are currently learning and scaffolding  questions according to Blooms Taxonomy.  Additionally, content area teachers will teach reading comprehension skills  explicitly such as visualizing, inferring, determining importance in a text, summarizing, and synthesizing information to enrich  the language development of all learners in their classes. Finally, materials such as bilingual content glossaries, translated word  walls, native language dictionaries, and technology programs are utilized to increase ELL outcomes.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      During the intake process, students' native language is evaluated. In the High School, Spanish teachers give native language  students diagnostics to determine the level of Spanish proficiency and eligibility for the Regents or LOTE.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     6a. In order to make sure that SIFE students needs are met, the ENL teachers,  Matthew De Leo, Amanda Rinzel,  Taina Benjamin, Nancy Lu and Amy Hu and will be tutoring  before or after school to target basic English acquisition skills such  as phonics, the alphabet, sight words, etc.             Some of the strategies used by the ENL teachers for Developing ELLs are:            -Differentiating and translating content            -using tier graphic organizers and assignments             -utilizing Bloom's Taxonomy to level questions            -providing students with a 'reading buddy' who is fluent in their native language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                -utilizing i-ready and ixl for English language acquisition                      6b. In the middle school newcomers receive 9 periods per week of ELA instruction, totaling 405 minutes of ELA instruction  per week.  The ENL teachers push in for 8 of the ten periods of the week, totaling 360 minutes of ESL instruction within the ELA  classroom. In addition, the ENL teacher pulls her ELLs out five times a week, totaling 180 minutes. The combination of push-in  and pull-out, therefore, adds up to 540 minutes.  Additionally, newcomers will attend Saturday Academy classes to support  their ELA and Math content area classes from January through May.  In the high school newcomers follow the program  described above in question 3. Moreover, newcomers are invited to Saturday Academy classes from January to June to receive  support in Regents based classes.  Tutoring is also offered after school on a needs basis.  During the summer newcomers are  offered additional instruction during our summer school. Ells and former ELLs are provided with the option to use translated  versions of assessments, as well as extended time and a separate testing location. Long term ELLs also receive the  differentiation strategies mentioned above at the discretion of the instructor. Long term ELLs are serviced by the ENL teachers  in their Push-in classes. Former ELLs are eligible for extended services for up to 2 years after testing at a Commanding Level on  the NYSESLAT,  including half a unit of integrated ENL instruction and extended time and a half.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs identified as also needing special education services are served as per the mandates on their Individualized Education Plan  (IEPs). These students receive both services and are invited to all academic intervention services available (before or after- school  tutoring and Saturday Academy). In order to ensure that all students that are both ELLs and SWDs, the ENL teachers,  the principal and the Special Education team meet at the start and throughout the school year to schedule times and devise a  plan when the ELLs-SWDs within the community are offered the services as per their IEP mandates. The ENL teachers schedule  push-in times and pull-out periods to target these students and, through the use of technology implement differentiation  strategies that target each student's needs. Due to the lack of a Transitional Bilingual Education program at Bronx Latin,  students whose mandates state they should be in this program are referred to the NYC Department of Education Enrollment to  assist them in finding a placement.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   The school uses various tools to ensure that curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility will meet the diverse needs of  ELLs-SWDs in the least restrictive environment. First, the ENL teachers and teachers of SWDs will meet periodically to discuss  students’ progress and areas of high need. This ensures that there is a support team meant to address every student’s needs.  Tutoring before and after school is available to all ELLs-SWDs who would benefit from the additional one-on-one support. All  ELLs-SWDs are encouraged to attend. Finally, the ENL teachers utilize their push-in time to service those students in a more  open, content related area in which students work in groups, both heterogeneous and homogeneous, according to their  ability.                 8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   The following programs are the targeted intervention programs available to all ELLs regardless of years of service.  There is  always a heterogeneous mix of ELLs as well as non ELLs in these programs.       a.  Before and after school tutoring in math and ELA for middle school and high school students.       b. Saturday Academy classes - middle school and high school students.  ELA and math classes are offered in the middle  school.  All Regents classes are offered in the high school.    c. Native language in intervention programs is used if necessary.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       In grades 6-12, 10 special education teachers are included in the staff in order to target students who are both classified as ELL  and have IEPs. This will ensure that these students receive the one-on-one attention necessary for their academic success.  Additionally, students receive additional enrichment classes in both ELA and math classe in both the middle school and high   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      school. These classes are meant to foster skills learned in ELA and math classes. The ELA enrichment classes utilize the Castle  Learning and i-ready. The math enrichment classes use ixl to provide students with visual explanations of math word problems.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    At this time, the Bronx Latin School will not be discontinuing any programs/services for ELLs.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  a.ELLs are invited to participate to all curricular and extracurricular programs. For example, Bronx Latin offers before and after  school tutoring provided by ENL teachers for ELLs.  Saturday Academy classes are taught by content area teachers and ENL  teachers who Push-in.  ELLs are invited via letters that are translated and backpacked home, followed by parent outreach by  the ENL teacher or content area teacher to provide parents further explanation of program. All ELLs are also invited to  participate in clubs and teams after school such as sports, robotics, student council/community service, and Amnesty  International.         b. The Tutoring programs mentioned above are supported by Title III funding. After school tutoring takes place twice a  week, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:35 pm to 4:05 pm. Saturday Academy takes place from 9:00 am to 1 pm from  February to May.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   14.  a. The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs:         High School         a.  Prentice Hall Regents Preparation Books         b.  Coach Regents Preparation Books         c.  NYSESLAT Preparation Books         d.  IXL for Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry         e. Rosetta Stone        f. Castle Learning for all Regents Courses        g. English Dictionaries and Bilingual dictionaries        h. Thesaurus                  Middle School         a.  Coach Preparation for NYS ELA and Math Exams         b.  Common Core preparation books         c.  Empire State / NYSESLAT / Continental Press         d.  IXL         e.  English dictionaries and Bilingual dictionaries         f. Rosetta Stone         g. i-ready         h. Thesaurus     13b. Some additional materials that teachers use at Bronx Latin to support ELLs are bilingual dictionaries, translated word  walls, native language translations of texts, differentiated assignments, and tiered tasks       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the middle school, students do not have any instruction in Spanish. However, content teachers and the ENL teacher provide  native language support in their lesson delivery: for Entering and Emerging ENLs, teachers provide translations of texts. For  Transitioning and Expanding ELLs, teachers use graphic organizers, word abundancy, and vocabulary building activities to  ensure that ELLs are not only acquiring the content, but also the second language. In addition, peer tutors who are fluent  speakers of ELLs' native language are utilized to assist ELLs.  Moreover, translated word walls and books in the libraries in  classrooms also contain texts and materials in ELLs' native languages. In the high school students have Spanish 5 times per   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      week.  The instruction focuses on supporting their reading and writing skills as native speakers of Spanish.  Students whose  first language is French also take Spanish at this time because there is not enough funding for a French teacher.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    There are four ENL teachers at Bronx Latin.  The middle school ENL teachers work with students in grades 6-8.  The support  and instructional materials that she uses corresponds to the ELLs' ages and grade levels.  The high school ENL teacher only  works with students in grades 9-12 and the support and instructional materials they utilizes correspond to the ELLs' ages and  grade levels       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     14.  a. The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs:         High School         a.  Prentice Hall Regents Preparation Books         b.  Coach Regents Preparation Books         c.  NYSESLAT Preparation Books         d.  IXL for Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry         e. Rosetta Stone        f. Castle Learning for all Regents Courses        g.

Some additional materials that teachers use at Bronx Latin to support ELLs are bilingual dictionaries, translated word  walls, native language translations of texts, differentiated assignments, and tiered tasks       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELL students participate in the following activities in the beginning of the school year:         a.  Each ELL student is assigned an advisor who speaks Spanish or has experience working with ELLs.         b.  Each ELL student is invited to an orientation that is given in both Spanish and English.         c.  The school sends correspondence to parents in their native language to introduce them to the school, explain the dress  code, and invite them to an orientation.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    In the high school, all students take Spanish. ELLs take Spanish as their language elective. The class is heterogeneous.  There is  usually a mixture of native speakers and heritage language learners.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   1.  Differentiation strategies and the implementation of literacy standards specified in the new Common Core State Standards  (CCSS) is the school-wide professional development focus.  All content area teachers and ESL teachers will receive professional  development in these areas during the 2017-2018 school year.        The following staff members received professional development during the 2017-2018 school year:                        a. Assistant Principal                        b. Subject area teachers                        c. paraprofessionals                        d. ENL teachers                        e. guidance counselors                        f. special education teachers                        g. psychologists                        h. occupational/physical therapist                        i. speech therapist                        j. secretaries   Professional Development dates for current year are as follows:       August 30 and 31, September 6, November 7, 2017 and January 29, 2018.       o  Differentiation Strategies - Four full day professional development sessions will take place focusing on how to meet the  needs of    students in heterogeneous class environments.  The professional development consists of the following components:           a.  A rationale for why there is a need to differentiate for diverse populations           b.  How to begin implementing differentiate strategies in the classroom           c.  Vocabulary Development            d.  Tiered assignment           e.  Questioning           f.  Self-paced strategies           h.  Classroom-management strategies for tracking differentiated work           i.  Flexible grouping           j.  Anchor activities          o.  Common Core Learning Standards            a.  Teachers develop a deeper understanding of the CCLS            b.  Teachers examine the developmental progression of the CCLS for literacy and understand the respective demands for  both teachers and students            c.  Teachers identify the implications of the CCLS to instruction and assessment            d.  Teachers begin to align their curriculum maps and assessments with the new standards     Staff received professional development in how to implement an effective advisory program.  The main purpose of the Bronx  Latin advisory program professional development is to train teachers to be a liaison between the school and the parents and to  train teachers to conduct parent outreach so that parents can monitor their children's academic and social progress in  school.  Additionally, professional development focused on the implementation of advisory trains teachers to facilitate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         "workshop-like" activities that help them to develop personal relationships with students, support students as they transition  from one grade to the next, and build students social and emotional skills enough so that they can make productive academic  and life decisions. The guidance counselor received additional professional development in which she learned how to assist  transitioning ELLs. Some skills she acquired included how to ensure that ELLs are at ease with this change through open  conversation, what strategies and or steps they can use to facilitate this change, and by working on developing an  environment conducive to students' success.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ELL training is embedded in the professional development for applying differentiation strategies in their classes.  Teachers will  have approximately 12 hours of professional development in this area during the 2017-2018 school year. The professional  development will focus on how to implement an Argumentative Writing Task into all subjects, including ENL classes, as  mandated by the NYC Department of Education's goal and expectations for 2017-2018 school year. Some of the activities that  were targeted were:  -how to write an argument by citing evidence  -how to write a counterargument and a conclusion  -how to rate teachers according to the Danielson rubric  -how to write an informational essay  -how to differentiate content according to students' needs.         Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 by providing ELL specific professional  development the week prior to the official start of the 2017-2018 school year. During this time, 2 hour of PD were devoted to  training teachers on how to plan instruction for all their ENL students. Through the school year, the ENL Department will follow  up with Professional Development to be delivered on the dates mentioned above and during mandated after school meetings  as necessary.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs on Mondays, between 2:35 and 4:05 pm. During this time,  teachers meet in grade teams to discuss any issues/concerns. Parents are invited to come in and meet with teachers of all  content areas during this designated time.  Translation services are made available during this time, including the presence of a  translator and  documentation in native language.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  1.  All parents are invited to participate in the parent association.  Parents who are members of the SLT report school activities,  school progress, and recent decisions and/or changes in the school's programs at PA meetings.  Parents are invited through  phone calls and letters to attend other school activities such as trips, workshops, performances, and conferences.  Parent  outreach is conducted by teachers, the administration, and the family worker. A translator is made available if need be,  whether it is the ESL Teacher or other members of the school community who are fluent in parents' and students' native  languages.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Annette Fiorentino, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Latin                                                                              School DBN: 12x267  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
