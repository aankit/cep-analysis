This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      At Paulo Intermediate School, creating and maintaining the highest educational climate possible is a priority and it is  promoted with excellence in teaching and learning. Our mission is to provide an educational program that enables  every child to master the skills needed to become a highly productive and caring citizen. At our core is a well-defined  differentiated and meaningful curriculum, tailored to our unique school setting. An atmosphere of cooperation,  tolerance, and an appreciation of the cultural heritage of different people and civilizations pervades our educational   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      setting. The essence of our efforts at Paulo is to ensure that each student realizes whatever unique potential of body,  mind, and spirit that he or she may possess.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As we continue to strive for excellence and promote student achievement, several collaborations, partnerships, and  initiatives have been implemented and maintained to strengthen our Framework for Great Schools. Teachers College  Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP), resources and philosophy have been the basis of our English Language Arts  program for the past eight years. In conjunction with TCRWP, we are also participants in the Middle School Quality  Initiative, (MSQI), which allows us to effectively target our at-risk students and implement key components and tiers  for MSQI 5 Pillar Literacy Framework. This year we are participating in the Learning Partners Program (LPP). Model  Teachers are used to establish an exemplary classroom, demonstrate lessons, and explore emerging instructional  practices, tools and techniques. Participants are able to reflect on visits from colleagues and plan next steps. In  addition to the above collaborations, IS 75 will continue their partnership with the district and the implementation of  the Core Collaborative, where we work together to collectively build teacher efficacy. School leaders and teachers  have been working on digging deeper into the standards to develop curriculum documents that will reflect focus  standards and success criteria for all students. Teacher Impact Teams support collaborative learning around the  formative assessment process in the classroom.    To align with our school mission of improving math practice and conceptual understanding, we have partnered with  Algebra for All and The National Training Network (NTN). Our staff is working with NTN to raise the level of  achievement and confidence in mathematics by looking closely at the instructional methodology and by digging  deeper into the “why” when solving mathematical problems.       The school offers an innovative ASD program, designed to provide individualized supports and services to students on  the autism spectrum. The ASD Nest program helps students with autism strengthen their interpersonal skills and  succeed in the classroom. The Nest program is strengthened with a coach who supports Nest teachers around  strategies to better meet these students’ needs academically and emotionally. Ongoing professional development is  provided by Nest to support all teachers and students.       We have an ACES program which prepares the students with daily living skills and provides them with a multi-sensory  approach to learning. The students in the ACES program partner with community members and take trips to visit  community members and facilities. Our students are offered a Saturday Social program where they are introduced to  projects that would enhance themselves as members of the community.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   IS 75 is a middle school with 1,364 students from grade 6 through grade 8. The school population comprises 1.83%  Black, 11.80% Hispanic, 75% White, and 9.24% Asian students. The student body includes 1.69% English language  learners and 22.36% special education students. Boys account for 50.81% of the students enrolled and girls account  for 49.19%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2018 - 2019 was 84.5%. Our ELL learners are provided  support from our ENL teachers. Our special education students are provided with an ICT setting, 12:1 services,12:1:1  services, and pull-out, push in services as determined by their IEP. To improve school attendance we have  implemented a plan to have perfect attendance rewards for students who have perfect attendance during that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      month. We have added additional after school activities to engage students. In addition, we have implemented  advisories. During our morning advisory traits of being a successful student are discussed.        4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Paulo Intermediate School prides itself in focusing on all of the elements that provide the Framework for Great  Schools; however, our greatest progress can be seen in our collaboration of teachers. Teachers engaged  collaboratively and regularly through the mentioned initiatives, Professional Learning Communities (PLCs),  Interdisciplinary Team meetings, common teacher plan time, Instructional Team, impact teams and ongoing  professional development. Teachers, administrators, and school leadership personnel share develop and implement  our school’s instructional focus of questioning and discussion practices to extend the learning that results in high- quality work products.      Our key instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to build on the progress and successes of the  Core Collaborative. In response to The Framework for Great Schools, if educators and supervisors use purposeful  protocols to guide their Impact Teams, it will strengthen professional capital and build teacher efficacy, directly  resulting in more rigorous instruction and increased student learning.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R075   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1371   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The 2018-2019 ELA and Mathematics school year data is being used to target specific Common Core Learning  Standards and our data will be evaluated as we move towards the Next Generation Standards. The 2017-2018 ELA  data report shows that 66% of our students are proficient in ELA compared to 59% the previous year. We want to  improve proficient levels in ELA to 70% in the 2018-2019 school year. The 2017-2018 Math data report shows that  58% of students were proficient in math compared to 51 % proficiency in the previous year. While improving our  rigorous instruction we plan to increase our proficiency level to 60%. Teachers will continue to review and modify  teaching practices based on the items skills analysis breakdown.Teachers will use this data to adjust their teaching  methods and create more rigorous tasks. Teachers will create formative assessments to monitor the progress,  improve student achievement and increase the outcome of the performance.       In response to The Framework for Great Schools, educators and supervisors found a need to utilize formative  assessment to help students identify their strengths and weaknesses. They will target areas that need support and  assist faculty in recognizing where students are struggling and address concerns immediately. If educators  continuously revise and develop formative assessment practices through student peer and self-evaluation, then  student learning will be extended, resulting in higher quality work products and improved student outcomes in all  subject areas.      Instruction across all disciplines will be challenging, engaging and vertically aligned across grades. Classes will be well- defined with clear expectations for student success. Classrooms will be interactive and personalized by using  Chromebooks, I-pads, and Promethean boards, to build and apply knowledge.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      In response to The Framework for Great Schools, if educators and supervisors further develop formative assessment  strategies through student peer and self-evaluation, then student learning will be extended, resulting in higher quality  work products and improved student outcomes in all subject areas. By June 2019, the implementation of this goal will  result in a 3% gain in students performing at level 3 or 4 on the NYS English Language Arts Exam and 3% gain on the NYS  Math Exam.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Our school will continue using targeted support from Paul  Bloomberg/Core Collaborative, Teachers College, The Middle  School Quality Initiative (MSQI), National Training Network (NTN)  and Algebra for All to strengthen our formative assessment  process which will enable us to create appropriately rigorous  tasks. Our professional development team will provide a wide  range of professional development services, including in-school  staff development devoted to implementation of self-assessment  rubrics and checklists. We will use the guidance of the Core  Collaborative to enhance our Impact Teams. The teams will  continue to meet regularly to build teacher/student  collaboration and learning. Staff developers will be leading  demonstration lessons within classrooms and at various  professional development sites in order to convey state-of-the- art teaching methods.             School leaders will be leveraging the strengths of our strongest  teachers to provide support for their colleagues through learning  walks and inter-visitations. Evidence of assessment for learning  in the classroom will be done by the creation of  rubrics/checklists/exit slips. Under this framework, teachers and  administrators will collaboratively work on providing teachers  with the tools and techniques, to give and receive accurate,  respectful descriptive feedback. Staff will develop accurate  learning goals and revise their work using feedback. Students will  work collaboratively with their teachers to monitor their own  progress. Teacher teams will engage in collaborative inquiry  based on student data and determine next steps to revise their  instruction as needed. Educators will use Summative  Assessments from the 2018-2019 NYS ELA and Math exams to  drive instruction.      Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

The success of the formative  assessment process is dependent on a culture in which all  educators are collaborative and focused on reflective practice to  improve student learning. Data received through the formative  assessment process, will be used to drive instruction. Students  will reflect on their strengths and next steps based on feedback  from peer/self-assessment and teacher feedback. Students will  be able to identify, apply and give feedback using success  criteria. They will be able to engage in reflective dialogue with  peers and teachers based on rubrics/checklists. Students will get  regular feedback from teachers. They will create SMART personal  learning goals and revise assessment based on feedback tied to a  rubric/checklist. Students will keep track of their progress and  continue to set new learning goals.      Families will be encouraged and provided multiple opportunities  to increase their involvement in their child’s learning.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In response to the Framework for Great Schools, educators and supervisors feel a need to help shape our school and  peer-group culture so that we can maximize the motivation to learn and achieve. The importance of creating an  environment where students feel safe, valued and challenged to work is very important. After examining multiple  sources of data, information was gathered from the detention and suspension occurrences within the last three years,  a review of the Planning and Placement Team meetings, participation in after-school activities and student surveys.  Anti-bullying and Respect for All assemblies, March of Dimes walk, toy drive, coat drive and penny harvest drive, ASD  Nest Program and Perspectives Lab, SAPIS counselor, Giving Circle, peer intervention, 'Saturday Social' program, peer  tutoring, guidance, after-school activities, student honor roll and Arista society, service awards, student council, public  display and recognition of student work, all collectively showed that most students displayed respect for other  student differences and possessed a strong determination to be a vital contributor to our school in creating a sense of  value among students and staff.       We feel Paulo provides the necessary groundwork for hard work and academic success in our students and school.  While most students were active members of our school and community and found to value learning, an area of  concern that was highlighted was a small population of students who were less likely to be noticed and/or participate  in school activities. This awareness allowed us to reaffirm and strengthen our commitment to reach each and every  student. By fostering and encouraging a personal connection with each student, teachers and/or staff members were  able to create a culture that emphasized a sense of belonging and supports excellence. In a continued effort to  nurture a supportive environment for less visible students, teachers and staff will continue to “adopt” a student to  encourage them to be more actively involved in school activities, and allow themselves to be seen as valuable  members of our school, ultimately increasing student achievement. Opportunities for after-school activities,  interaction with students and their families, and creating a risk-free environment will allow all students to see that  they are capable of producing high-quality work and become an integral part to the success of our school and  community.   The Equity, Excellence, and Empathy Committee will plan activities to support the Advisory period. Students will join  the Principal for lunch to discuss the needs for the school. Student and teacher voice will be used to create  meaningful tasks to support social and emotional learning at Paulo. According to our School Quality Guide Survey  results from the 107-2018 school year, 74% of students say that their teachers use examples of different cultures,  backgrounds, and families in their lessons to make learning more meaningful. (Q1f) We will continue EEE Committee  and will provide students and teachers with culturally relevant material to meet the needs of all students. In addition,  new and trending diverse books have been added to our libraries.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21      We will continue our partnership with College Access for All program which encourages our 7th grade students to  explore various career options and helps them to navigate their journey from middle school to college.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June, 2019, staff members will recognize the individual needs and experiences of students, and work together to  better understand and support them. Homerooms are now advisory periods. This will serve to foster kindness,  character building, and empathy. By October 2018, teachers will select at least one new student to “adopt” to ensure  each student is well known by at least one staff member and create a safe and supportive learning community that  maximizes the motivation to learn and achieve.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   By June 2019, If educators collaborate successfully with the administration and are provided with specific and  targeted feedback, then the teachers will take that feedback and modify instruction which will provide a 5% increase  overall student achievement. After reviewing our observation reports, leadership members compared teacher  performance data with teacher evaluations and noticed inconsistencies. Within our safe and supportive environment,  our teachers will move towards taking risks and modifying instructional practices.    Our administrative team will continue to norm our practices to support our teachers. The successful collaboration  showed that 66% of our students are proficient in ELA compared to 59% the previous year. Our administrative staff  will continue to work together to norm practives and will improve proficient levels in ELA to 70% in the 2018-2019  school year. The 2017-2018 Math data report shows that 58% of students were proficient in math compared to 51 %  proficiency in the previous year.Feedback from administrative staff will be around supporting our school focus of  rigorous instruction and we plan to increase our proficiency level to 60%.    Professional Learning Communities met regularly to analyze student data, revise lesson plans while adjusting our  teaching practice and curriculum to meet the needs of our school’s population. Student work such as the MOSL pre- assessments, Performance Series, quarterly assessments, CCLS aligned performance tasks and classroom assignments  are analyzed to identify the needs of the students and develop strategies to support them. Every six weeks during a  Monday PLC, teachers meet in interdisciplinary teams to analyze the work of shared students to identify strategies to  support individuals who have been identified as at risk. A plan is put in place for assisting those students and is  reviewed at the next interdisciplinary meeting to determine if the plan is working or if it needs to be revised.       Teachers followed the model outlined in the Chancellor’s Handbook for Professional Learning to create five to eight  week cycles of learning. The teachers identified an area of focus and implemented a cycle in which they plan,  implement, reflect, adjust and share lessons learned. All of their work involved an inquiry based approach as teachers  review student work to inform their next steps. A significant portion of the work for this year focused on the District  31 initiative, in partnership with the Core Collaborative, to improve formative assessment through an understanding  of success criteria and learning progressions. Throughout the year, teachers and leaders work closely with the Core  Collaborative to jointly network with other professionals specializing in student-centered approaches to learning.  Teachers worked in teams to unpack the standards for both ELA and math and create banks of success criteria to  facilitate lesson planning. For the 2018-2019 school year we plan to unpack and begin the transition into the Next  Generation Standards. The teams have also created rubrics and checklists for students based on the success criteria to  make learning progressions clear for students and enable them to identify their own gaps in understanding.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28      Teachers who have strong instructional practice were identified and encouraged to host learning walks and to share  those best practices. They debrief so that teachers can support one another in bringing these practices into their own  classrooms. Teachers also engage in regular inter-visitations which are more focused on each individual teacher’s  specific needs and interests.       Special education teachers meet monthly to collaborate on their IEP teams to discuss student progress toward goals.  In addition, teachers planned collaboratively to develop Word Generation lessons, as part of our work with MSQI, to  support at-risk students. Our MSQI staff developer was able to meet regularly with teachers and assist in the planning  and supporting struggling students.      The success of this work was tracked through performance tasks, quarterly assessments, analysis of student work and  Performance Series results, teacher feedback and Learning Cycle data. As a response to areas that would build upon  our strengths and support growth in less mature areas, educators and administrators created our 2018-2019  instructional focus to focus on creating rigorous tasks based on student data. The Core Collaborative Impact Team  model, a strengths-based, PLC model, will allow us to put "students at the center” by supporting the implementation  of the formative assessment process in the classroom. Teachers will use quality evidence to collaborate around what  works for all students through the Impact Team process and create rigorous and relevant tasks. This cohesive  approach will enable us to strengthen and foster student learning while promoting independence, resulting in higher  student achievement.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, the implementation of an Impact Team Model will enable us to thoroughly review student work to  support the revision of curriculum and related lesson plans to meet the needs of our diverse learners. The Impact Team  Model and the implementation of this goal will result in a 3% gain in students performing at level 3 or 4 on the NYS  English Language Arts Exam and 3% gain on the NYS Math Exam.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          29     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Our School will be using the Impact Team model introduced by  the Core Collaborative, Paul J. Bloomberg, Ed.D & Barb Pitchford,  M.A. The Impact Team model is a strengths-based, PLC model.  Teachers will support the implementation of the formative  assessment process in the classroom and use quality evidence to  collaborate around what works for all students through the  Impact Team process. During the learning cycle, Impact Teams  will check in with each other frequently to share successes,  challenges, and sharing artifacts. Teachers will use student voice  to make timely corrections as needed. Coaches participate in PLC  and plan time meetings to support the teachers while reviewing  data and creating lesson plans. Coaches work with teachers to  implement action plans into their classrooms.    Each teacher will choose a learning group and/or demographic  group (ie: long term ELL student, at risk student, gifted and  talented student, etc).

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.    Effective school leadership are strong leaders that anchor their work on central issues of learning and teaching and  continuous school improvement. As a vital component to the Framework for Great Schools- Effective school  leadership lays the foundation for positive school improvement results. Our school meets weekly in PLC's and plan  time to provide opportunities for meaningful teamwork. Student work is analyze and teachers plan for instruction to  address areas of concern that have been identified. School leadership provides our team with clear, measurable goals;  and the regular collection and analysis of performance data to provide teams with meaningful and actionable  feedback. Our instructional leadership also leads our school through the goal-setting process by using a clear guide in  the cycles of learning in which student achievement data is analyzed, improvement areas are identified and actions  for change are initiated. Leadership works collaboratively with staff and school community to identify discrepancies  between current and desired outcomes. The instructional leadership will set and prioritize goals to help close the gap  and develop improvement and monitoring strategies aimed at accomplishing the goals. Our team will communicate  goals and change efforts to the entire school community. We also try to ensure that staff development needs are  identified in alignment with school improvement priorities and that these needs are addressed with appropriate  professional learning opportunities through Teachers College, MSQI, Learning Partners, NTN, mentoring, inter- visitation, learning walks or any other means of support available.    Upon reflection and review of observations in the 2017- 2018 school year, our team found a need to improve our  feedback for the upcoming 2019 school year, to teachers and staff with the emphasis on consistency and  cohesiveness within our instructional team. Through multiple observation strategies and instructional rounds, we will  ensure our feedback to teachers is consistent meaningful and actionable, particularly around our instructional focus  of formative assessment. Teacher observations, teacher feedback and evidence of student growth will be use  determine if in fact these strategies and supports were effect in improving student achievement as a direct result of  strong, effective school leadership.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  Effective School leadership, as supported by the Framework for Great Schools, is essential to the success and  improvement of classrooms and schools. Through multiple observation strategies and instructional rounds, we will  ensure our feedback to teachers is consistent, meaningful and actionable, particularly around our instructional focus of  formative assessment. The implementation of this goal will result in a 3% gain in students performing at level 3 or 4 on  the NYS English Language Arts Exam and 3% gain on the NYS Math Exam.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   The Danielson Rubric will establish a school wide understanding  of what highly effective teaching looks like. The leadership team,  through a use of the rubric, and creation of their own success  criteria for highly effective teaching, will be able to provide  coherent, concise, clear and focused feedback to teachers.  Teachers will have a shared understanding of what high quality  teaching is and be able to reflect upon their own practice to  determine where they are at and formulate their own next steps.  This will create a culture trust and will cultivate an atmosphere of  learning.   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?   Timeline  What is the  start and  end date?

Administrative Staff,  Instructional Team,  School Leadership  Team,Learning  Partners, Model  Teachers and  Coaches      be scheduled within each department in 6 week intervals to  coincide with our cycles of learning. The primary purpose for  these rounds will be to observe teachers and compare their own  instructional practices with those of the teachers they observe.  The chief benefit of this approach will reside in the discussion  that takes place among observing teachers at the end of the  observation as well as in subsequent self-reflection. A self-  reflection template and checklist created by the instructional  team will be use to record what teachers found useful, what  practices they believe would benefit their students and how they  plan to try-out these instructional practices in their classroom.       School leadership will norm their observations by conducting  joint observations and debriefing about the low inference notes  taken. Leaders will then confer and collectively discuss the lesson  and its effectiveness. Using the Danielson rubric, low inference  notes taken, will be used collectively to determine the strengths  of the lesson as well as next steps. This feedback will then be  messaged to the teacher to ensure a more consistent, actionable  and meaningful focus for teachers to improve instruction.           School leaders and teachers will use the School Leadership Team  to support instructional practices, such as formative assessment  and rigorous instruction, that will be shared and implemented to  promote a successful school.The SLT, will ensure a collegial  environment and a school-wide culture grounded in trust and  mutual respect based on shared expectations and high quality  teaching. Parents will be provided multiple opportunities to  increase their involvement and awareness through Parent  Orientation, PTA meetings, curriculum newsletters, Literary  Night, Math Night, and parent workshops. Parent support will  strengthen the focus of our team and will increase parents'  understanding about the formative assessment process and how  collecting student data will lead to the creation of rigorous tasks,  that will be taking place in their child's classroom. Parents will be  offered the opportunity for their child to attend after school  tutoring provided by other students in city high schools and  CUNY outreach. Students will also have the opportunity to attend  Saturday math tutoring, held by their teachers.              3b – Parent and Family Engagement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and  strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Paulo, IS 75, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Paulo, IS 75 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?                   The formative assessment and/or curriculum-embedded assessments used to guide instructional planning for our ELL  students are:   The data provides insight for our instructional plan for the year. After reviewing our Performance Series, teacher created  assessments and TCRWP running records we are able to create small group lessons to support our ELL students. After  reviewing the data, we noticed our ELL student have shown growth in their reading levels after a year of support.  NYSESLAT data shows with the help of differentiation and supports, 20% of our current ELL population has achieved a level of  commanding, while 50% has shown a steady increase English fluency.                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?             Instructional decisions are based on individual student needs as shown through our formative and  summative data. Teachers use the data to modify their curriculum by differentiating their units based on the needs in their  class.  Staff members who currently have ELL students in their classes are provided with data on how students are progressing  from their ENL teachers and through formal and informal data collection.  Our ENL teachers use various websites such as  a4esl.org.com to use students' home language as a resource.               At IS 75 we evaluate student success through the NYSESLAT and other formal assessments (NYS ELA and NYS Math Test).  These results are used to drive classroom instruction. Teachers create differentiated learning groups based off the individual  needs of the student.             During our Professional Learning Communities teachers work together to analyze student data. Teachers then use that  data to develop an action plan on how to address the areas of strengths and weaknesses of the ENL students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?                   Knowledge of typical second language development and the student’s history of first and second language (e.g.,  educational background) is considered when setting benchmarks and interpreting progress for our ELLs.   When evaluating  instructional programs for students, it is important to gauge achievement levels for the site's overall population and for  particular groups (i.e., ENLs) using outcome assessments designed for these purposes.                  At I.S. 75, one way we  evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs is through the NYSESLAT we administer each Spring.  This is an extremely useful  tool in helping us to see the gains the ENLs are making in our program as well as which modality the ELLs need further  assistance in to achieve Proficiency in the English As A New Language program.  We are also able to evaluate the success of our  program by using other formal assessments throughout the academic year.  Each fall, when the ENL teacher has access to the  NYSESLAT scores from the previous spring, she is able to see how many ELLs have received an overall score of "Commanding"  based on these results.  We use this as an indicator to modify instructional programs. Another way we are able to evaluate the  success of our programs for ELLs is by analyzing their test results on State Exams.                 After reviewing summative assessments the identified areas of need includes; providing visuals, scaffolding  assignments, group work,identifying spelling patterns, read alouds, and think alouds.   Our teachers also provide instructional  opportunities throughout all literacy practices and our ENL teacher turn key best practices throughout the year.                  Our content area teachers also maintain portfolios for all of their students, including the ELLs.  Upon analyzing the  contents of the portfolios as the year progresses, we are able to monitor and evaluate the progress being made by our ELLs  across the curriculum.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?                       Once the areas of need are identified we begin to create an action plan for intervention. Students are placed in  small groups and also receive push in support from an ENL teacher. Teachers are also provided with professional development  to help support their classroom needs. ELL students are also provided with after school remediation to help build their  language acquisition skills. Within the classroom,students are provided with supportive materials to meet their needs such as;  directions translated, pictures, vocabulary banks, manipulative, increased wait time, and/or sentence frames. During the 2016- 2017 school year we partnered with The Community Word Project to increase academic vocabulary by connecting the arts and  science. The project brought in trained professionals to help support our ELL students and provides language intervention  throughout the year. We will continue our partnership for the 2017-2018 school year.                       An after school enrichment program has been designed to another intervention that our school is providing to our  ENL to ensure their academic and social success. The program will address both the social and academic needs of our ENL  students with support from our ENL teacher. During the program our ENL teacher(s)  will have the opportunity to work with  the students on basic interpersonal communication skills and cognitive academic language proficiency.                      School leadership attends professional development to support the ENL instructional practices. They work closely  with the ENL teachers to analyze data to drive classroom instruction, providing feedback as needed.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                  Our school is an intermediate school in which our ELLs are in grades 6-8.   There are several important features of the  Response to Intervention (RTI) system that can be used to meet academically at-risk ELLs’ needs.                 The first step in  which our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs is through the UNIVERSAL SCREENING administered to all students  using the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) .   We use this information to uncover the factors that could influence  the student’s English language learning process, including whether or not a student is eligible to take the NYSITELL. The  NYSITELL is then used to establish a baseline of student performance as well as a student's command over the English  language.  This exam also identifies students who may not make academic progress at the expected rate due to an  unfamiliarity with the language. Screening assessments give clear indications of risk in specific domains through set  benchmarks or criteria, or by detailing how a child performs relative to peers of the same age or grade level.  The ELL student  also takes part in RTI screening to assess whether his/her literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade level benchmarks.  If an ELL student is flagged as at-risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill or competency, the student will receive  targeted instructional support to bolster development in this area. This support is delivered in coordination with language  support services.  The at risk ENL students will then be offered after school enrichment programs to meet their needs.  Students are also offered the opportunity to attend Wilson, Orton, and/or ELA/Math enrichment courses.         In addition, progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and/or  services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services.  When progress is monitored, the expected  rate of an ELL’s progress takes into account language development and background. The student’s progress is then compared  with levels demonstrated by peers from comparable cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds who have received the  same or comparable intervention.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   An explanation of data patterns in overall NYSESLAT proficiency scores is as follows:    Therefore, what is revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT is that the majority of our ELLs from  grade 6 through grade 8 need additional academic support with their writing in English as the academic year progresses. The  writing in English seems to be the most challenging for our ELLs, where as the speaking performance level seems to be  highest.  According to the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT data, we uncovered that our ELLs are gaining English proficiency with listening  and speaking.  This shows that they are making progress with their interpersonal conversation skills. This also proves that our  ELLS are  able to understand the language   before being able to provide thorough written responses.   Paulo ENL teachers have used the data to drive instruction around producing clear and coherent written responses.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Based on the needs of the students, teachers use the following structures based on our assessment findings:   Our school data specialist provides teachers with the NYSESLAT as they are updated. Teachers have access to the data in ATS,  which they use to guide their PLC work. School leaders attend PLC to work with teachers to analyze data and create an action  plan for instructional practice.     Specific questions that are analyzed are in the listening, reading,speaking and writing sections. Teachers and school leaders  read the questions and students answer to help determine where there are common misconceptions. Teachers use the Home  Language Survey along with interviewing the students and families to gain a better understanding of a student's academic  background. These interviews not only determine where the student is from, but if the student has studied or had instruction  in English before.     Teachers and school leaders will continue to review NYSESLAT data, performance series data, TCRWP running record data, and  teacher created assessments in order to modify the curriculum to help support students when a learning or instructional gap is  revealed in the data.     The NYSITELL data will determine a student's handle on the English language.  These scores will provide teachers with the  student's strengths and areas of weakness, in order to determine the intervention and supports needed, eg; tutoring, socio- pragmatic language supports, after-school programs, or other structured literacy programs that directly and systematically  teaches the structure of the English language.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68           Teachers, school leaders and other support staff meet on Monday during PLC time to plan and determine program  adjustments for students. Student data is reviewed and placement is determined.     School leadership members provide classroom observation, where they provide useful feedback. School leaders attend PLC to  determine if the action  plans created by the teacher are effective.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           Instruction for ELLs is delivered as follows: Our students are grouped together in "block" classes where they travel  together as a group.  The students are also grouped according to their grade and they are programmed  heterogeneously (mixed proficiency level).   Integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part  154.2.  Our ENL teacher possesses Permanent New York State Certification in Teaching English to Speakers of Other  Languages (TESOL).   The ENL teacher uses the RLAT report in ATS to gain access to the ELLs' NYSESLAT results from  the May exam.  She uses this report to help determine the mandated number of ENL minutes her students are  required to receive based on their Levels of proficiency.  These levels include: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning,  Expanding, and Commanding.  These levels (based on the CR Part 154 Requirements)  determine the minimum  number of minutes of standalone ENL, the minimum number of minutes of integrated ENL, and the minimum number  of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  The ENL teacher pushes-in to several academic  classes, i.e. English, social studies,science and math and works collaboratively with the academic teachers to make the  content comprehensible to enrich language development.  The goal of this integrated ENL instruction is to build  English language skills through content area instruction. In our school it is delivered through co-teaching by a certified  ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both  methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language development using  ENL strategies.   The content areas are delivered in English.              The licensed TESOL teacher also provides standalone ENL on a daily basis for one or more periods (40 minutes  per period) according to the mandated time needed for the student's proficiency level.  The ENL teacher makes every  effort to pull students out of non-academic classes.  The maximum number allowable grade span or grouping  instruction in grades K-12 ENL classes is two contiguous grades.  If more time is needed, the student is pulled out for  one period during science, social studies or mathematics.  The ENL teacher also uses a push-in model for our SIFE  student as well as some of our other ELLs to enhance the student's comprehension in that subject class.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The organization of our staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to  proficiency levels in our ENL program model.  Our school uses the Proficiency Level as determined by the NYSITELL score for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      newly enrolled ELLs or NYSESLAT score for those returning ELLs.   We also ensure the mandated number of instructional  minutes are delivered by placing the ELLs together in the same homeroom whenever possible, including those former ELLs  who are mandated to receive services for two years after reaching the proficient/commanding level on the NYSESLAT.                      Students who have an Entering and Emerging Level receive a total number of 360 minutes of ENL.  The Entering  students receive a minimum number of 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  The Emerging  students receive a minimum of 90 minutes of standalone ENL and a minimum number of 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA.  Those students who have a Transitioning or Expanding Level receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL.  This includes 0  minimum number of minutes of standalone ENL.  The Transitioning students receive a minimum number of 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area. )  The Expanding  students receive a minimum number of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.    Our Commanding students  receive a total number of 90 minutes of ENL.  This includes 0 minutes of standalone ENL and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  or other content area.  In our school, our Entering students receive 4 periods of integrated ENL and 4 periods of standalone  ENL.  Our Expanding students receive 4 integrated periods of ENL.   Our Transitional students receive 2 periods of integrated  ENL with ELA and 2 periods of either integrated ENL or standalone ENL.  Our Emerging students receive 2 periods of  standalone ENL and 4 periods of integrated ENL.  Our Commanding students receive 2 periods of integrated ENL.                    Our program model also strives to enhance our ELLs’ existing home language skills.  We try to program our ELLs with  the same home language background in subject area classrooms.  Doing this allows students to access content by interacting  with each other at varying levels of language proficiencies. Teachers with groups of ELLs who have a common home language  are able to organize collaborative tasks that target content and generate interactions in the home language among peers.  Tasks are enriched with academic English language development. Also, home language resources (libraries, texts, technology,  primary resource materials) are available in the classroom and in the school’s library as additional resources that can  accelerate learning.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        The content areas in our program model are delivered in English.   All ENL students receive instruction in English by content  area teachers who have received training in ENL methodology, strategies and techniques either through college courses or by  SSO/District personnel.  Our content area teachers also participate in workshop training throughout the entire school year,  centered around reading and writing.  The content area teachers are given tools to help assess and move the students forward  in their academic progress.  One example of a literacy tool that the teachers can use on a daily basis includes a Common Core  aligned writing checklist.  This checklist is based on the three writing purposes (narrative, opinion, and informational).  The  teachers meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, around narrative opinion and informational  writing.  This enables teachers to meet their students at their current writing ability.  It is a tool to help assess and move the  students forward.  Thus, this is a "movement tool" to help the students reach grade level standards.  In addition, all teachers  are also provided with a Common Core aligned curriculum for both their reading and writing instruction.                     The ENL  teacher provides content area support for ENLs by pushing-in during the students' content area instruction and by  conferencing with the content area teachers to assist whenever and wherever possible.  The ENL teacher also helps the ENLs  develop effective study skills in the content areas so that they can meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.   Some of the materials that are in used in our program include:  IPads, Chromebook, Laptops, Bilingual  Dictionaries/Glossaries, and Promethian Boards.  The ENL teacher provides content area support for the ENLs.  While the ENLs  are working with their peers, the ENL teacher is constantly monitoring her students and circulating around to each of them  ensuring that the ENLs understand all of the Academic Vocabulary being presented in the lessons.  All aspects of the lessons  are able to be translated into the students' native language as needed to support the content being taught/presented.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year.    We have school personnel, who speak the students' native language, to facilitate and assist the ENL teacher in   accomplishing this task of acting as our translators.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status                      Differentiating instruction for each of our ENL subgroups is essential, especially since most classrooms are composed  of students with varying levels of English proficiency and subject area expertise.  Our goal is to accelerate ENLs’ academic  English language proficiency and content-area mastery.   The following is a description of how we differentiate instruction for  our ELL subgroups:        When a newly enrolled ELL student enters our school, the grade assistant principal, ENL teacher and parent coordinator  meet with the student and parents (or other English-speaking family member) to orient them to our school and special  programs, to discuss the child's program and to answer all questions.  The student is placed in classes tailored to meet his/her  proficiency level.  The grade assistant principal and ENL teacher notify each of the child's teachers both verbally and in writing  regarding the unique background and needs of the ELL student.  They also receive Academic Intervention Services both during  and after school as necessary.  In addition, the parent coordinator collaborates with the ENL teacher to prepare orientation  materials for incoming ENLs and their parents.  We try the best we can to place our Newcomers with a "Buddy" in his/her new  class.  This helps the Newcomer follow his/her new schedule, etc.  Our instructional plan for SIFE is as follows.  SIFE students  arrive at our schools with low or no literacy skills in any language. Some are behind in content knowledge for their age.  Many  also have complex social and psychological needs due to traumatic migration experiences, frustrations with their  academic delays in relation to their peers, a lack of familiarity with school culture, and isolation in school.   We know that the more literate students are in the home language, the stronger and more expedient their transition to  academic English proficiency.          Our SIFE students need a great amount of language acquisition and vocabulary support.  They need a foundation for the  language, sometimes at the most basic and beginning level.  They need help with  following directions and distinguishing  between sounds not in native language.  They need strategies for how to remember sight words when word meanings are not  understood.  We also know that figurative language can be very confusing in English for these ELLs.  Finally, since our SIFE can  easily feel frustrated when it comes to processing this challenging English, our goal when it comes to differentiating our  instruction for these ELLs is to offer as much support as possible.  This will ensure that their language acquisition is a success.  Our teachers also work to acclimate the students to the structure of a school setting by providing the student with a nurturing  and positive environment.             Similarly, those ELLs receiving service between 4 to 6 years and and our Long Term ELLs are placed in literacy and math  blocks designed to provide them with rigorous academic subject area instruction combined with individualization and  differentiated instruction. We want to enhance student understanding of English while learning classroom content, as well as  offer English-proficient peers to serve as language models.   In addition, these students, as well as other Intermediate and  Advanced proficiency level students who tested out, receive both school day and after school Academic Intervention Services  as needed.   Transition Plan for Students Reaching Proficiency: (Former ELLs after exiting ELL status)       Students reaching proficiency will receive school day academic intervention through approved AIS/Study Skills classes in a  small group setting, focusing on assessed needs for additional instruction.  These students will also be offered participation in  our Academic Intervention Services after-school.  Our instructional strategy for all ELLs in our school, from newcomers to long- term ELLs, also includes attendance in our UAU extended day program.  Here, differentiated instruction is utilized to provide  access to academic content areas and assist in accelerating English language development.  Our plan for former ELLs is to  continue to encourage them to attend our UAU extended day program.  These students also receive two more years of testing  accommodations on their State Exams, which include, extended time, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and separate  location.  Former ELLs also receive mandated services up to two years after exiting ELL status, as per CR Part 154.2.  This  includes 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL in content classes only.  In addition to the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire and  Guidance documents, some of the available resources on the NYSED website are; a Writing Screener which is used to quickly  identify students’ basic writing skills as another data point to assist with the screening of potential SIFE. Another tool that may  be used is the SIFE Screening, Identification and Placement Flow Chart, which is a one page flow chart that outlines the steps  involved in identifying Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education, as outlined in Part 154 of the Regulations of  the Commissioner of Education.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      Plan for Alternative Placement in Special Education:       The IEP will be examined.  Special Education services as well as ELL instructional services will be provided according to the  instructional plan on the IEP and in conjunction with the recommendations of the School Assessment Team and the Student  Progress team.  In addition, ELL students identified as having special needs receive appropriate support services such as  speech, occupational therapy, counseling, hearing and physical/occupational therapy.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?                  In order to meeting the needs of ELL students with disabilities within the least restrictive environment our ENL  teachers collaborate closely with the teacher. The teachers plan on supporting each other by using both Special Education and  ESL methodologies. Our ELL students are serviced for the time allocated as per their proficiency levels. The teachers will use 6- 8  grade level materials and scaffold the materials to support the students on as need basis.                       Time is allocated for teachers during PLC and plan time to work collaboratively in teams.  Increased professional  development for content area teachers will be provided year long through Teachers College, Middle School Quality  Initiative and the District Field Support Center.           During Professional Learning Communities, teachers look closely at student work and create an action plan and next steps  that are needed to reach grade level performance. Teacher create an action plan and determine strategies that will work in all  classrooms. Teachers and administrators will also utilize PLC  to turnkey pertinent differentiation strategies obtained from  professional development and site visits to other schools. ENL instructional strategies and materials such as use of visuals,  graphic organizers,  modeling and small group instruction will allow for better acquisition of the English language.  In addition,  other instructional scaffolding techniques will be used, such as bridging, contextualization and schema building.  The use of  programs such as Achieve 3000 , Measuring Up, Learning Ally, Reading Works, Raz Kids, Google Classroom, Nearpod, text to  speech and speech to text allow teachers to adjust materials that are grade and age appropriate.              Throughout lessons in all content areas, there are opportunities for student driven discussion based on their class  content. Students are provided with time to "stop and jot" or ask any clarifying questions to their teachers and/or peers.  Some  materials that are resourceful include writing checklists, interactive read-alouds, and mentor texts.  Mentor texts are model  texts that are used during Writing Workshop as a foundation to support more rigorous writing development. Teachers use  "think aloud" strategies to show how to make their thinking visible. All mandates on the IEPs for ELL-SWDs are managed and  ensured through monthly meetings that are held with case load managers that are designated for each team of teachers.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals  and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  Programming for these students is achieved by allowing  students who demonstrate strength in a particular subject, attend an ICT class while remaining in a 12:1 for more intense  support in the area of need. Students also receive push in support when appropriate.          Our school uses differentiated instruction as a method of helping ELL-SWDs to expierence success and attain their IEP goals.  Teachers will use flexible grouping in order to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve success. For example, a teacher will start  with a mini lesson, then will use formative assessment data to determine the level of support needed for the individual  students throughout the lesson. Grouping and regrouping is an ongoing process and is adjusted accordingly,  based on the  students IEP goals.       Our school encourages the use of technology which gives our ELL's-SWD's an opportunity to learn learn at their own comfort  level, pace and modality of their choice. Teacher will use Google Classroom , where an extension  is available to students,  which can support the translations of documents, if needed.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.             Instruction for ELLs is aligned with the citywide comprehensive core curriculum in literacy and state standards. One of  our targeted intervention programs for our ELLs in ELA is the Workshop Model and The Balanced Literacy Approach.  This  program consists of independent/paired reading, shared reading, guided reading, literacy centers, interactive read aloud, word   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      study, writer's workshop, literature circles and teacher/student reading and writing conferences.   In addition, we use the following targeted intervention programs that are offered at our school:        This range of intervention services in our school for the areas in ELA, math, and other content areas are offered in the  English language.  Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas includes using data from  our ELA and Math state exams,  Reading and Literacy Assessments, subject skill, concept, knowledge assessments, assessment  portfolios, curriculum-based measures, formative assessments, standardized norm-monitoring of multiple interventions  attempted, Performance Series, Learning Progression chart, teacher conference notes, Achieve 3000, MOSLs (Measures of  Student Learning).  The ELL subgroups that are targeted are those ELLs who are receiving service between 4--6 years, and our  Long-Term ELLs (those who have completed 6 years of service.)  We also target our newcomers, those receiving between 0 and  3 years, so that we can give as much support to them as well.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      One trend that we have noticed is the gradual but steady increase in our ELL population each academic year.  As a result, we  have created a new English Language Learner Enrichment Program that will take place on a weekly basis.  Our data has shown  that our students's proficiency in speaking is high.  However, the ELLs need more opportunities to increase their listening,  reading, and writing comprehension.  Additionally, we have subscribed to "Scholastic News" magazine this year to foster more  comprehension with current events.      New programs and improvements scheduled for implementation next year include:  Word Generation, Learning Ally,Google  Classroom, Nearpod, and Ortan Gillingham.  Teacher will focus on the art of rigorous questioning and discussion, through  professional development, inter-visitation, learning walks and sharing of best practices in our Professional Learning  Communities. Teachers will work in grade-level teams to pool their expertise, learn from one another, and effectively support  student learning. Continuous tiered professional development in each of the core pillars will target the specific needs of a  school's staff and support the use of these programs.  Lesson plans will be created to support instructional techniques such  as  turn and talks, targeted small group instruction, with special emphasis on higher level ELL learners, as well as students with  disabilities, and Socratic Seminars. The implementation of these programs and improvements will allow our ELLs and SWD to  grow both academically and socially.  We will continue to encourage all of our ELLs, no matter what level of proficiency they  are, to attend our UAU after school program, where small group instruction takes places and serves them best in succeeding in  our school and in the making attainable gains in their English language development.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The services for ELLs prove to be highly effective in our school. Therefore, at this time, no programs/services for ELLs will be  discontinued.  I.S. 75 has not had a bilingual program because parent choice has been ENL.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.               ELLs are afforded equal access to all of our school programs in our building.  ELL families are encouraged and provided  with multiple opportunities to increase their involvement in their child’s learning.  Math Night, Literacy Night,Summer Slide,  Parent Orientations, PTCs, Saturday parent support groups and parent classes, will increase parents’ awareness about the  intensified academic rigor of teachers’ classrooms and  provide an understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards  giving them the tools necessary to ensure  the best support for their child at home.                 Families are informed via our school’s website IS75.org, puplipath.org, school messenger and our monthly newsletter of  all upcoming events. Through the same lines of communicated parents are provided with updates on our school- wide  instructional focus, any school wide initiatives and any support programs available.                 Students are also provided with  Academic Intervention Services through after-school (including UAU extended day  services) which focus on assessed needs for additional instruction to improve literacy and mathematics skills.  We also afford  equal access to all school programs through translated notices and personalized attention from ENL teachers.  Our Media  Specialist monitors both student and faculty use of resources and provide support for any/all individuals when necessary.  Finally, our school provides all required support services according to ELLs ages, needs, and grade levels.                    School leadership members review attendance programs to ensure parents of ELL students are attending all available  programs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In addition to extensive leveled classroom libraries, our ELA, AIS and TESOL licensed teachers use a variety of  books and materials recommended for ELL students.  The following is a sampling of some of these materials:  The mathematical material that are being used for the ELL's are  We also have access to Promethean boards in the classrooms that can be used in conjunction with some excellent  technological resources such as:  Literacy Shed (for visual/auditory aids), Discovery Education Streaming Videos, and other  resources that are available to all our ELLs via our school website:  www.IS75.org.  Instructional materials are also used to  support ELLs in the content areas.  These materials include leveled material from National Geographic, Scholastic, and Achieve  3000.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home Language Support is delivered through translation services (literature/notices) materials  in accordance with ELLs native languages.  We have translators at our school that are always available to assist our ELLs should  the need arise.  In addition, we have materials available in the native language for the parents of our ELLs.  Our ENL teacher  has access to a variety of websites that enable her ELLs to work in both languages.  We have a variety of high incidence languages opportunities for our students to read through News ELA, trade books, and the  New York Public Library. Students  have access to Chrome books where textbooks are available in multiple language through  Discovery Education.              14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required support services and resources correspond to ELLs' ages, needs, and grade levels by .Data from student  performance on ELA and Math state exams, Performance Series, as a secondary diagnostic, Achieve 3000, writing pieces from  Word Generation, pre and post test in English, Prosper Data, Quality Review recommendations, portfolio review, item skills  analysis, Advance, reading and literacy assessments in subject skill, concept, knowledge assessments, curriculum-based  measures, formative assessments, standardized norm-monitoring of multiple interventions attempted, Learning Progression  chart, teacher conference notes, Achieve 3000, MOSLs and other valid, reliable assessments will allow teachers and support  personnel to share information and determine appropriate materials and resources to correspond to ELLs grade and age  level.   Resources such as our Guided Reading Library, Achieve 3000 and Learning Allies allows for teachers to differentiated  non-fiction and fiction text to use with struggling readers that correspond to their age and grade level while also addressing  their cognitive needs.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Support materials are made available in the teachers center. Although we don't share a building, support materials are  available to all support staff.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, our schools assists newly enrolled ELL students by providing an "Open House /  Orientation" in the beginning of September.  This enables our ELLs and their parents to meet our staff members and take a  "tour" of our building to alleviate any/all anxiety the students might be feeling about entering a new school.  In addition, our  school hosts a "Curriculum Conference" in September for grades 6 through 8.   Teachers meet with the students and parents to  provide important information regarding what the students will be learning throughout the academic school year.  For new  ELLs who enroll throughout the school year, the Assistant Principal for each grade takes any/all time needed to sit down with  the parents and ELL to provide an overview of our school and assist in scheduling the student for his/her classes.  The ENL  teacher also meets with these newly enrolled ELLs and their parents to answer any/all questions that may arise.  Our goal is to  help ensure that the ELLs are comfortable and not afraid to be in a new school.  We want to help them with this transition as  best as possible.     Our guidance counselor supports the ELLs with their transition onto high school by providing them with insight on program  options that are available throughout the High Schools in New York City.  She meets with the ELLs at any time needed to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         answer any questions they have.  She helps the ELLs complete the High School Application.  She also gives the ELLs information  regarding "Open Houses" in the High Schools.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language electives that are offered to our ELLs include Spanish and Italian.   The students receive instruction in these classes throughout the seventh and eighth grade and are offered  two days per week.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?             Professional development and support for our school staff is ongoing throughout the year to better prepare our teachers  and support personnel in delivering instruction that will allow ELLs to achieve academic success throughout the year.  Targeted  support from staff developers from Teachers College, MSQI, and NEST provide a wide range of professional development  services to all of our Administrative staff, teaching staff (including special education staff), and support staff.  In school staff  development from Teachers College is devoted to implementation of reading and writing workshops, as well as content area  literacy instruction for all level learners.   Staff developers lead demonstration teaching within classrooms, modeling state-of- the-art methods of questioning and discussion, and small group lessons that target struggling students.  Our Nest staff  developer provides all service providers, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, and speech therapists, with Tier I, II  and III interventions and strategies that can be readily applied to our ELLs.   Administrative Staff, Instructional Team, Learning  Partner Team Members,  Model Teachers , Coaches and additional school leaders will be leveraging the strengths of our  strongest teachers to provide support for their colleagues through learning walks, inter-visitation and impact team meetings.           Under this framework, teachers and administrators will collaboratively work on providing teachers with the tools,  techniques, mentors, and academic community to lead state of the art staff development and provide feedback along with  next-step goals.  This framework will also allow lead teachers in each content area to highlight the latest thinking about  content area literacy and instruction, thereby establishing a data-based literacy leadership.                                Targeted support from MSQI, will allow us to use the five core pillars to strengthen literacy practices and better prepare  and support at risk students, SWD’s , and ELL’s to become grade-level readers. The Performance Series will provide benchmark  and diagnostic data to identify struggling readers. Correlated multiple assessment data will ensure that students are  progressing and track student growth over time via text volume and diversity, and how text is read (individually, small group,  whole group). In addition, students receive targeted support with specific strategies or skills with literacy in the content areas.  Teachers will work in grade-level teams to pool their expertise, learn from one another, and effectively support student  learning. Continuous tiered professional development in each of the core pillars will target the specific needs of a school's staff  and support the use of programs and researched-based practices such as Word Generation, strategy lessons, guided reading,  Socratic Seminar, and Notice and Note.  Faculty conferences, department meetings and additional PD time are used to explore  resourceful ESL methodologies and various topics such as using NYSITELL  and NYSESLAT scores as Instructional Tools, using  Instructional Scaffolding Techniques (visual, verbal, and auditory),  Using Multiple Strategies for Teaching the ELL Student, and  Assessment and Multiple Ways to Monitor Student  Progress.           The TESOL teacher meets with the literacy and math coaches monthly to implement Teachers College in ELA and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         Mathematics.  Secretarial staff, parent coordinator and paraprofessioanls receive training during Monday Professional  Learning Community on best teaching practices that supports our ELL population.  In addition, Election Day, Anniversary Day,  and designated PD days in June are use to train staff in differentiating instruction,modifing curriculum for ELL students and  different strategies that will support teachers as they work with our ELL population.  Throughout the school year, our staff also  attends various trainings, seminars and workshops throught the city.                    Our ENL and bilingual teachers of ELLs attend QTEL and BSFC workshops and will provide staff development for our  faculty with the assistance of the English supervisor.  Faculty conferences, department meetings and additional PD time are  used to allow teachers of ELL to explore resourceful ESL methodologies and various topics such as using NYSITELL  and  NYSESLAT scores as Instructional Tools, using Instructional Scaffolding Techniques (visual, verbal, and auditory),  Using Multiple  Strategies for Teaching the ELL Student, and Assessment and Multiple Ways to Monitor Student  Progress.  The TESOL teacher  meets with the literacy and math coaches monthly to implement Teachers College in ELA and Mathematics.    Our professional learning series will be provided by our ENL teacher, where they will turn key best practices to the staff. On  Mondays during our PLC sessions teachers will work together to provide professional development to the Non ELL teachers.  Our PD will also take place on Election Day, at EDCamp, and any Chancellors Regulation days. We will work with the Staten  Island Field Support Center once their dates are released to provide professional development for our ELL, Non ELL and  administrative staff.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ELL personnel including all teachers of ELLs will receive professional development in accordance with CR Part 154.2 in the areas  of language acquisition, co-teaching strategies, and alignment with core content are instruction. Teachers will receive their  required professional development hours through a combination of in-house sessions as well as off site workshops. The in- house sessions will be held during PD time on Mondays. The assistant principal will oversee the programs and professional  development. Off site PD is available and provided by the district field support team and from support staff from out school  programs (NEST,TC, MSQI,LEARNING PARTNERS)   In person meetings, phone calls and any relevant information will be kept in an individual file held by the ELL teacher.  A formal  record of the parent’s preference of ELL program for their child, retained in the student’s permanent record and accessible for  State or City audits and reviews. A copy of the completed Parent Survey & Program Selection Form will be provided to the  parent upon request. Our school's principal secretary is responsible for maintaining the records (agendas, attendance) of the  PDs for the non-ELL teachers and the ELL Teachers.  They are maintained in the main office of our school.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual Individual meetings, phone calls and/or emails are provided for parent or guardians of ELLs, generally to discuss the  goals of the program, their child’s language development progress,  English language proficiency assessment results, and  language development needs in all content areas. Meetings, phone calls and/or emails are conducted during parent during a  mutually agreed upon date and time.  Parents are provided with the opportunity to meet with various school staff and support  personnel that can provide information regarding their child’s language development in all content areas.   For students  enrolled in a bilingual education program the meeting will be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language  or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands.  Schools record attendance by using "sign in sheets."  The  sign in sheet includes the parent's name, student's name and ATS (homeroom number).      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         With the help of our parent coordinator, ENL and Foreign Language Teachers, we conduct outreach in their native language to  parents of ELL students.  Several meetings are held  to orient parents to the various programs offered in our school and to  provide suggestions for helping their child at home.  Our parent coordinator makes every effort to find someone who speaks  the child's home language in order to answer clarifying questions and/or support the needs of family. A video and parent  letters in their native language are given at the parent orientation.  In addition, parents receive monthly PTA newsletters.  Free  books and materials are given away to students to encourage literacy at home.   Families of ELLs are encouraged and provided  multiple opportunities to increase their involvement in their child’s learning.  Math Night, Literacy Night, Parent Orientations,  PTCs, Saturday parent classes, will increase parents’ awareness about the intensified academic rigor of teachers’ classrooms  and  provide an understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards giving them the tools necessary to ensure  the best  support at home.   Families will be informed and via our school’s website IS75.org, puplipath.org, School Messenger and our  monthly newsletter of all upcoming events, highlighting pertinent information on the new Common Core Learning Standards,  our school- wide instructional focus, and the Framework for Great Schools as the foundation to establish and strengthen our  ties with the community.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   I.S. 75                                                                              School DBN: 31R075  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess the language preferences of the parent community for both written  and oral communication is as follows:   In our school community we have Parent Orientation sessions that are on-going throughout the school year and  Curriculum Conferences (that take place in September). In addition, our Assistant Principals consistently meet  with all parents at the time of initial enrollment in our school. When parents first enroll their child in our school,  our pupil accounting secretary contacts our ENL teacher so that the ENL teacher can administer the Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS). Our ENL teacher possesses Permanent Certification in Teaching English to  Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). Our ENL teacher is notified about this new admit immediately and meets  with the parents to make an initial determination of the child’s home language. She is able to determine the home  language based on the HLIS results, which includes an interview with the student and parent in the language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      preference. The ENL teacher also reviews pertinent information from Part III of the Home Language Identification  Survey regarding how the parent wishes to receive written and oral communication from our school. Any/all  information completed by parents at the time of initial enrollment is maintained in a secure location within our  general office inside the ELL's cumulative record folder. This folder includes their emergency card and Home  Language Identification Survey. Finally, our ENL Coordinator/Teacher works with the Pupil Accounting Secretary to  print out the "Adult Preferred Language Report" (RAPL) in ATS. The report lists the students alphabetically and  enables us to see the "SPOKEN LANGUAGE" and "WRITTEN LANGUAGE" preferred by the parents of all students in  our school.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
