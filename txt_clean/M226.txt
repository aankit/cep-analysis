This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At P226M, our mission is to ensure that every student achieves his or her potential through rigorous instruction that  promotes high expectations for ongoing cognitive, social-emotional, and physical development, in order to become a  life-long contributing member of society.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Building capacity in all constituents is central to our philosophy and central to an elevated school culture and high  instructional expectations. Thus, the learning environment at P226M includes both students and staff.   During the 2017-18 school year, teacher led projects were collaboratively planned, developed and implemented at  each site according to the ages and abilities of the students they serve. Progress was tracked over time and on  Chancellor’s Day, June 2018 each site led a summative presentation about their project. These presentations were  led by teachers, related service providers and/or paraprofessionals before a group of approximately 190  professionals at a full school staff meeting in June. These collaboratively planned projects are expected to continue  throughout the 2018-19 school year.    Principal’s weekly emails define clear expectations and also identify and celebrate best practices in use at our  school.    Through the creation of staff teams and cohorts, teachers’ voices are heard. These cohorts include PPTs at each site  focused on behavioral supports and strategies. Additional teams explore a variety of curricula and classroom  strategies, and a Professional Development Committee identifies desirable PD opportunities    Student specific supports include Emotional Literacy, our CHAMPS matrix, and CHAMPS Student Clubs aligned with  each student’s expressed desires. Various student cohorts work collaboratively to express their opinions and desires  related to school events such as theater, performing arts, and field trips. Students older than 14 are mandated to  attend their IEP conferences.   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P226M offers a wide variety of rigorous, quality educational environments to accommodate our students in their  least restrictive environments, from Pre-K to age 21. All of our classrooms are in community buildings with typically  developing, age appropriate peers.    Our students are instructed in five special instructional ratios; 8:1:2, 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 8:1, and 12:1:1.   According to their IEP's, our students are diagnosed with autism, emotional disturbance, intellectual disabilities, and  speech/language impairment.   In addition, 97% of our students are alternate assessment.   For students aged 18-21, classrooms are in both academic and vocational settings.    Skill streaming is implemented for math by regrouping students from their classroom group to a more homogeneous  math class comprised of students from various classes and based on their math assessments.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The P226M vision expressed in our mission statement is “to ensure that every student achieves his or her potential  through rigorous instruction promoting high expectations for ongoing cognitive, social-emotional, and physical  development, in order to become a life-long contributing member of society.”   School-wide goals that illustrate this vision were collaboratively designed by all stakeholders and these are the  elements in which our school made the most progress. These elements are related to our SCEP goals:     Rigorous Instruction evidenced by increased ratings of Danielson Component (3C) – engaging students in  learning through appropriate differentiation of activities, materials, and resources. (Differentiation is our  school-wide focus for this year.)  Supportive Environment evidenced by increased use of student communication systems/supports in  classrooms.        Collaborative Teachers evidenced by a collaborative Inquiry Team implementing Dynamic Learning Maps to   develop appropriate tasks and entry points in order to increase reading skills.      Effective School Leadership as evidenced by Professional Development and Collaborative Partnerships in      order to implement Structured Teaching Schedules and Workstations.  Strong Family/Community Ties as evidenced by the creation of a variety of parent/guardian events aligned to  results from our P226M Parent Needs Survey                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75M226   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08,09,10,1 1,12,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)   275   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     During the 2017-18 school year, P226M continued to make progress across all academic areas. In math, we  maintained our focus on the mastery of counting, numeration and addition/ subtraction skills. Based on the Early  Childhood Assessment of Math (ECAM), students across all grade levels displayed 86% in skill mastery from baseline  to endpoint. In addition, 9% of students tested out of the ECAM in the area of counting, 11% of the students tested  out of the ECAM in the area of numeration and 26% of the students tested out in the area of addition/subtraction.  This school year, we incorporated the Brigance mathematics assessment to address the need for differentiated  instruction for our students performing beyond a 3rd grade math level. (Brigance data)      Based on the 2017-18 Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA)-2, 72% of the P226M students tested demonstrated  gains in reading level from baseline to endpoint. 20 students were unable to score on the (DRA)-2. To address the  differentiated needs of those earlier learners, we implemented the Structured Methods in Language Education  (SMiLE) program in 2 classrooms. In preparation for the upcoming school year, we have trained 2 teachers and 2  paraprofessionals in the SMiLE program and will be increasing implementation of the program in additional  classrooms. During the 2017-18 midpoint assessment period, we discovered that 5 students tested out of the  Kindergarten to Grade 2 (DRA)-2. After a successful pilot of Grade 3-8 (DRA)-2 assessment, we plan to implement it  school-wide during 2018-19 school year.      Across all content areas, teachers focused on developing differentiated activities, materials and resources to  appropriately engage students in learning. During the 2017-18 school year, we saw an increase in the use of multi- leveled resources in classrooms across all sites. From the initial to final observations throughout P226M, data on  Advance showed that 3% of teachers across all grade levels increased in ratings on Danielson Component 3C:  Engaging Students in Learning. In the area of Danielson Component 3C, Advance showed that 24% of our teachers are  currently rated Developing or below. Additionally, during an instructional half-day of professional development, 100%  of staff engaged in a data analysis exercise to better understand the factors that impact student engagement. Staff  input demonstrated a need to shift the focus to designing coherent instruction. Therefore, we have decided to shift  our school-wide focus to designing coherent instruction to produce clear and sequenced units and lessons.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Teachers wanted to explore other instructional models that might better support our students and allow for better  individualization of the curriculum. Part of the P226M belief system is the use of a holistic approach , using best  practices from diverse instructional methodologies.      During the 2016-17 school year , we started a pilot within Kindergarten classrooms at our 12th Street site. We  provided staff development, inviting autism coaches and experts in the area of Structured Teaching, along with the  support and knowledge of the site coordinators. One of the classrooms implemented TEACCH schedules and  workstations as an alternative to the workshop model.   The 2017-18 SCEP goal was that school leaders would implement professional development and provide  opportunities for collaborative partnerships that promote teacher capacity for teachers working in a 6:1:1  Kindergarten through grade 5 settings by implementing Structured Teaching schedules and work stations resulting in  50% increase in the number of classrooms implementing TEACCH Strategies.   This goal has been achieved through the implementation of Structured Teaching Schedules and workstations at the  12th Street and P76 sites.   Additionally we have 5 classrooms partially implementing aspects of structured teaching. Based on students'  performance at the independent work station and completed work samples, students demonstrated increased  engagement and independence.   During a PPO visit, a recommendation was given to collect specific data on student progress during the independent  workstations.   During our quality review the reviewer noted that our classrooms using Structured Teaching Strategies were a  highlight for our school. It was recommended to to take specific individual data for each student during independent  work stations in order to monitor student individual growth and independence.   For the 2018-19, school year we will increase capacity by having the classrooms that partially implement Structured  Teaching Strategies to fully implement and expand this strategy to other site locations.   A Structured Teaching cohort comprised of teachers and administration will create a data collection form to assess  student progress during independent workstation and generalization of tasks. Classroom staff members will collect  data during the implementation of schedules and workstations activities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18                       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element.

Over the course of the 2017-18 school year, P226M’s grades 3 through 5 teachers collaborated through an inquiry  team to apply Essential Elements of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), by using the Dynamic Learning  Maps (DLM) to develop appropriate tasks and entry points based on student assessments. A group of teachers met at  several points during the school year to look at alignment among students’ Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goals,  assessments, and the ELA teaching points.   As a result of this, teachers realized that the teaching points were rich in literacy and text-based skills, but lacked  foundational reading skills students needed to develop basic decoding and fluency skills. The cohort reviewed possible  instructional curriculum to address student needs. SMILE and Fundations curricula were identified as appropriate  instructional tools to address the students’ current functional skills and move them forward to the next level.  Teachers, paraprofessionals, and related service providers participated in district provided intensive training using the  selected curricula in order to incorporate them into their teaching practice. Families were also introduced to these  curricula during a parent workshop in order to support and extend student learning at home.   The team uncovered the need to modify the current assessment tools to integrate IEP driven management needs in  order for students to more accurately demonstrate their strengths and needs.   According to the data from the 2017-18 school year 3 out of 7 students in the targeted group have shown increases in  the reading skills. These students had not shown any progress in prior years. Students participating in this inquiry  team demonstrated a 75 % movement towards the target linkage level. Additionally, these students also  demonstrated a slight increase in their DRA assessment   Beginning the 2018-19 school year, the current P226M DLM Inquiry team will expand to include a second cohort of  teachers in grades sixth through eighth. Teachers in the target groups will use a balanced literacy approach to our ELA  curriculum. Students will develop foundational reading skills through the selected curricula, and use the DLM mini  maps to identify appropriate entry points to the 226M Units of Study. The 226M grade 3-5 and 6-8 teachers will  collaborate through an inquiry team to apply the DLM assessed Essential Elements in reading literature and  informational text to develop appropriate tasks and entry points as per students’ IEP goals and move students closer  to the target Linkage Level. Student progress towards the target will be demonstrated by work samples included in  226M student portfolios. It is expected that 50% of the students in the sub group will move through the linkage levels  closer to the target Essential Element.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Part of the P226M belief system is the use of a holistic approach, using best practices from diverse instructional  methodologies. Our goal for the 2017-18 school year was to incorporate Structured Teaching schedules and  workstations in selected 6:1:1 elementary classrooms. School leaders collaborated with District 75 to organize a two- day TEACCH training provided by the District 75 Office of Autism. The training was attended by teachers,  paraprofessionals and related service providers. Additionally, year-long in-house support was provided by our  TEACCH-trained P226M instructional coach.   During the 2017-18 school year, it was observed that teachers working in our 6:1:1 Kindergarten through Grade 5  settings implemented various components of the Structured Teaching approach. We now have 8 classroom teachers  incorporating one or more component of the Structured Teaching methodology. For the upcoming school year, we  will continue to build our capacity and to increase student independence and student engagement through the use of  Structured Teaching practices.   In planning for the 2018-19 school year during an instructional half-day of professional development in May 2018,  100% of staff identified barriers to delivering differentiated instruction. Staff across all sites identified time for  collaboration as the biggest obstacle for delivering differentiated instruction. Based on Advance data, administration  was able to confirm that that we did not achieve our goal for differentiated instruction during the 2017-18 school  year. We will continue our commitment to differentiated instruction, but plan to shift the focus of our leadership goal  to designing coherent instruction in order to produce clear and sequenced units and lessons. For the 2018-19 school  year, school leaders will support teachers in developing differentiated instruction by providing regular opportunities  for collaborative unit planning. School leaders have designated all of our instructional half-day professional  development sessions to the collaborative creation of differentiated unit plans for ELA and Social Studies. It is  expected that at the end of the 2018-19 school year, we will develop clear, sequenced and differentiated unit plans  for 75% of our existing ELA and Social Studies Units of Study.

We provide workshops, transitions meetings, Family Fun Fridays and annual  school events such as the Spring Fling, Disney Musicals in School Performances, Art shows, Science fairs, etc.   During the 2017-18 school year, we provided a Parent Survey to assess parents' interests and provide them with  relevant workshops in order to increase parent involvement.   108 surveys were collected. According to the surveys, parents were interested in the following topics: Eating habits  and nutrition, medical issues with autism, being an advocate for your children, supporting positive behaviors, social  skills and life after 21.   Workshops were created according to parents' interests. Despite the input from the parents, we still saw low  attendance at these workshops. While P226M did achieve an overall increase in parent participation, it was largely  due to increased attendance at school-wide events.   According to our schools survey results parents expressed that they wanted more communication with the school.   This year, we started a pilot program using Class Dojo, an app used to communicate with parents. Through Class Dojo  teachers communicated directly with parents and provided photos, text messages, school notices about upcoming  events and translation to parents' native language.    The feedback from parents was overwhelmingly positive as evidenced by the results of a Class Dojo survey.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

The P226M Title III  Plan for English Language Learners (ELLs) is a comprehensive plan that adheres to the  guidelines for Title III. The majority of students receiving English as a New Language (ENL)  services at P226M are students with severe disabilities who require specific strategies and  individualized techniques to address their specific needs, including the use of communication  systems and direct social skill instruction, while building their levels of independence.   P226M’s Title III program will service 8 ELLs with a 6:1:1 ratio in grades 2nd, 3rd and 4th. It  will be conducted in English by an ENL certified teacher and an Art teacher that will collaborate  in all aspects of planning and delivery of instruction. Instructional support will be provided by  two paraprofessionals: One fluent in Spanish, and a 1:1 (as mandated by the IEP of one of the  students participating in the program).    The students participating in our program are from our upper elementary site (P226M@P185) in  Upper Manhattan. This site was chosen for the implementation of our program due to its  proximity to students’ homes and public transportation. Its accessibility will make it easier for  parents to attend. The program will consist of 20 two-hour sessions that will take on Tuesdays  from 3:10pm to 5:10pm, from December 2018 to May 2019 (excluding holidays and school  closures). An administrator will be on hand to supervise all sessions and will be remunerated  from 3:50pm to 5:05pm.  The rationale for choosing this population is to reach students with significant communication  needs by utilizing a number of creative approaches embedding ENL strategies in the areas of  literacy and visual arts in order to extend participating students' reading, writing, speaking and  listening skills. This multifaceted approach will be the basis of the P226M Title III plan, in order  to facilitate students' acquisition of language/ communication skills.  The focus of the Title III program will be on language development in English through fine arts.  Students will make a piece of abstract art during each session and discover various styles of  contemporary art. The students' work will be displayed in the school, creating their very own  Abstract Art Museum. ENL methodologies (i.e.,Total Physical Response, The Language  Experience Approach) and strategies (i., Graphic Organizers, Think-Pair-Share, Modeling) will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46            Part C: Professional Development   also be utilized. Many of our students are non-verbal or have severe language delays, and require  specialized systems to support their communication. ELL students succeed when instruction is  focused on communication (Krashen, 2006). This program is designed to develop students'  vocabulary and expressive language skills in English.   During each session of the program, the students will work to create a piece of abstract art. Both  teachers will utilize ENL methodologies, supporting strategies and specific writing activities  designed to foster English language acquisition. Art books from Knowledge Industries will be  used as a resource to support instruction. All instructional activities will complement ENL  services required under CR Part 154, which our students are receiving during the regular school  day. P226M will use a number of assessment tools and rubrics in order to determine the  success/impact of the support provided to our students. Bulletin boards will showcase art work  and instructional activities from the program.    Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

The ENL teacher, the art teacher, paraprofessionals, and the  administrator in the Title III program will collaborate in three sessions, on Thursdays, two hours  each to share expertise in sharing their knowledge on how to support the needs of the ELL  students . These sessions will occur after school hours from 3:30 to 5:30pm, entailing scheduled  visits to various art museums, such as the Metropolitan and the MOMA, to study the paintings  and the artists reviewed during the sessions with the students. The ENL and Art teachers will  facilitate these PDs.   Additionally, Title III staff will take part in a 'Learning Study' session, analyzing and engaging in  collaborative discussion around the museum visits and strategies that best support language  acquisition.  By engaging in this professional inquiry,  the Title III staff will be better equipped  to meet the individualized needs of our ELL students with disabilities. The supervising  administrator will be remunerated from 3:46 to 5:31 PM.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

To assess early literacy skills and to demonstrate literacy growth, our data is based on the SANDI,  ABLLs, DRA,  Brigance, P226M Writing Continuum, student work, rubrics and updates to student goals in the IEP. ENL teachers meet with an  administrator and a district ENL coach to review assessments, student work samples, and monitor progress toward individual  annual goals.   Most of our English Language Learners in grades 3-12 participate in the New York State Alternate Assessment  (NYSAA) and in the ongoing P226M portfolio assessment.  As a result, new assessment-based tasks are always being  developed.  These tasks are designed collaboratively by the special education teachers, related service providers, and the ENL  teachers.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Twice a week, teachers meet in their teacher teams to evaluate student work and identify instructional next steps. ENL  teachers meet monthly to evaluate student work and identify next instructional steps as it relates to ENL annual goals.  Additionally, special education teachers, ENL teachers and coaches participate in task forces to collaboratively adapt and revise  curricula,  tasks and student assessment tools to best meet the needs of our ELLs. ENL teachers utilize the integrated (push-in)  model in order to instruct ELL students in the context of the classroom. Both the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher plan  collaboratively to provide appropriate instruction for ELLs that specifically targets their ENL goals.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs by analyzing the data collected on a variety of assessment: ABLLs-R,  Brigance, DRA  the P226M Writing Continuum, and attainment of IEP goals.In addition, classroom teachers in collaboration with ENL teachers  are engaged in inquiry- based structured professional collaborations to review IEP- driven student work samples linked to the  Common Core Learning Standards and determine next steps towards the attainment of ELA and ENL IEP goals.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Classroom teachers, related service providers and ENL teacher meet to collaboratively evaluate student progress toward ELA  and ENL IEP goals. These staff members participate in pre-IEP conference meetings to identify areas of need, develop realistic  and attainable goals for ELLs and identify management needs and supplementary aids that will support individualized  intervention.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   None of our ELLs grades K-2 take Standardized Assessments. Our entire instructional program incorporates AIS strategies, as  we differentiate across the curriculum for each individual learner.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Most of the ELL population at P226M is not eligible to take standardized assessments.  Instead they participate in the NYS  Alternate Assessment. In the 2017-18 school year, 100% of ELL students in grades 3-12, who received ENL services,  participated in the NYSAA.  Students in alternate assessment do not take standardized tests due to the severity of their  language and/or cognitive impairments,  as the data collected would not be meaningful.  Nonetheless, these students are  required to take the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT, including those who are served as per their IEPs.  Consequently, the results  of the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT do not reflect the true abilities or progress of our students. The NYSAA scores from these  ELLs students range from 3 and 4. This means the these students meet the Alternate Grade Level Achievement.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The NYSESLAT results from the 2017- 18 school year reveal that 16 ELLs scored at the entering level, 15 scored at the emerging  level, 4 scored at the transitioning level and 2 students scored at the expanding level. This data shows that the scores of most  of our ELLs are low due to language and processing deficits related to the students' diagnosis of autism or intellectual  disabilities. The result of the NYSESLAT suggest that we need to shift our focus to differentiating our instructional resources  and communication strategies to better meet the needs of each individual learner. For the 2018-2019 school year, the school  wide focus will be designing coherent instruction by producing clear and sequenced lesson and unit plans.  The information is shared through meetings with site coordinators, including the  ELL teachers . This information is transfer to  the teachers and at team meeting to the paraprofessionals.. During IEP meetings, the outcome of students' assessments data  and P226M student Portfolio are shared with parents.           Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   For ENL instruction, we use both the integrated ( push-in)  and standalone ( pull-out) model.  Using the integrated  model, the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher collaborate and co-teach to implement adaptations for the student  during whole class instruction. In this model, the ENL teacher spends blocks of time in the classroom with the  mandated student(s) and his/her classmates.  As the classroom teacher is instructing the full class, the ENL teacher is  specifically targeting the goals of the ENL students.  Both teachers plan collaboratively to provide the appropriate  instruction for ENL students. In the standalone model, the student is removed from class and works individually or in a  small group with the ENL teacher. Students are grouped by homogeneous proficiency levels. Students with no more  than a three year age difference are grouped together, and we follow student's IEP staff ratio when grouping. The  work done during these sessions typically targets the specific needs of the students in a certain subject area.  It is  always connected to the work they are doing in their regular classroom and it is used as a time of intensive practice or  skill development.  This standalone model is used for students to be able to generalize and apply the information they  are learning in one-on-one sessions back in the classroom.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We currently do not have  a TBE program    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We currently do not have  a DL program        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Generally, our K-8 students receive the CR Part 154 mandated minutes for ENL services at the beginner level (360 minutes)  using both standalone and integrated model, as well as a minimum of one 45-minute period daily of interventions,  imparted  by special education classroom teachers who have received Jose P. Training.  Our high school students receive up to 540  minutes of ENL, using both models, as well as instructional interventions for a minimum of one 50-minute period daily by  special education classroom teachers who have received Jose P. Training.  Within the context of our multi-sites school  organization, ENL providers group students in order to maximize the number fo possible minutes.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   We differentiate instruction in all content areas following the Common Core Learning Standards to address the individualized  needs of every learner.  We utilize a variety of curricula to address the different needs of our students, including the  P226M ELA Units of Study, EveryDay Math,  Go Math, Passport to Social Studies, STEMscopes,  Fundations, SMiLE and Writing  Without Tears.  We have also created a Transition Curriculum for our students ages 18-21. We address the social skills of our  students by implementing the Social Skills In Our Schools Curriculum by Dr. Michelle Dunn, the P226M Universal Positive  Behavior Support Protocols (CHAMPs), and Emotional Literacy.  Teacher dialogues with parents and guardians include a  discussion of students’ home language literacy levels.  This information strongly influences English Language Arts curriculum  design and individualized language development strategies.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   At this time we do not have bilingual classrooms. Our bilingual students are placed in monolingual classrooms with alternate  placement paraprofessionals that speak the students native language. The alternate placement paraprofessionals through  informal assessments evaluate students in their native language and with the collaboration of the ENL and special education   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      classroom teacher design the instructional lessons to accelerate English language development.  In addition, our bilingual  special education students are again evaluated at triennial conferences with the SBST and a bilingual psychologist  to ensure  the appropriate placement.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our students receive instruction in English through ENL methodologies by special education teachers. Instruction is  differentiated for each one of the students depending on their performance skills and their disability. Presently we have 30 ELL  newcomers. The school plan for new ELL students entering the English Language School System includes providing a nurturing  environment to facilitate language production via an experienced special education teacher and alternate placement  paraprofessional that are familiar with bilingual and ENL techniques.These techniques are learned through in-house trainings,  professional development opportunities offered at the District 75 office, and ongoing collaboration with ENL teachers.  If it is  possible, we also group students that share the same first language. This facilitates communication among students and  facilitates adaptation to the school system.  Strategies and instruction are focused around providing students with access to  classroom instruction related to grade level standards, with adaptations as needed.  Instructional materials include Core  Curriculum resources in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies, Mayor-Johnson visual supports, technology devices for  mandated students, and leveled libraries.  Most materials are presented in English, translated with the support of the  alternate placement paraprofessional who speaks their assigned students' home language. In the event that we receive a SIFE,  the same supports would be provided.  There are 11 students who have been receiving services for more than three years, but  less than 6 years of service. We continue providing ENL services as per their IEP and in accordance with their proficiency levels  indicated on the NYSESLAT.  Students who have received ENL instruction for 6 years or more, 8 students, receive additional  support in various areas including job sites, ADL, and community based instruction.  For these students, the emphasis of  instruction has shifted from classwork to community-based learning, to prepare students for their post-secondary  transitions.  We have no former ELLs, as no students test at the commanding level.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All of our students have IEP and they labeled with a disability.  We differentiate instruction in all content areas following the  Common Core Learning Standards to address the individualized needs of every learner. We utilize a variety of curricula to  address the different needs of our students, including the District 75 ELA Units of Study, EveryDay Math,  Go Math, Passport to  Social Studies, STEMscopes, Fundations, and Writing Without Tears.  We have also created a Transition Curriculum for our  students ages 18-21. We address the social skills of our students by implementing the Social Skills In Our Schools Curriculum by  Dr. Michelle Dunn, the P226M Universal Positive Behavior Support Protocols (CHAMPs), and Emotional Literacy.  Teacher  dialogues with parents and guardians include a discussion of students’ home language literacy levels and the the strategies  and/or materials used to promote understanding and communication. This information strongly influences English Language  Arts curriculum design and individualized language development strategies.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Most the students at P226M are classified as having autism and are placed in classrooms with a student to staff ratio of 6:1:1  or 8:1:1.  Three classrooms include students classified with Intellectual Disabilities and Emotional Disturbances, with a student  to staff ratio of a 12:1:1. Students spend time with non disabled peers during the lunch period and during specific designated  instructional times to promote appropriate social skills.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Common planning times are scheduled to optimize instruction in all Core areas  (Reading, Writing, Math, Science, and Social  Studies) in order to foster language acquisition. Classroom teachers, related service providers and ENL teacher meet to  collaboratively evaluate student progress toward ELA and ENL IEP goals. These staff members participate in pre-IEP conference  meetings to identify areas of need, develop realistic and attainable goals for ELLs and identify management needs and  supplementary aids that will support individualized intervention.  During instruction, the collaboration between the special  education teacher and the ENL provider is very important. They work as a team and they provide the appropriate instruction  for ENL students. During team meetings, the teacher, paraprofessionals, related service providers and ENL teacher  discuss strategies to optimize instruction for the ELL student; they develop cross curricular IEP goals utilized throughout  environments and periods within the instructional day. For high school students, Transition is considered a primary focus.  The  team collaborates to develop lessons that apply research-based ENL methodologies to all core content areas, such as ELA,  Math, Social Studies and Science,  that will be incorporated during instructional periods to maximize English language  acquisition for ELLs.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will continue with the programs that we had in place for the 2017-18 school year      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not discontinue any programs or services.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all P226M school program as they participate in monolingual classrooms with embedded  supports alongside their peers who qualify for programming with the same instructional ratio. The supplemental instructional  services provided through the Title III serves eleven ELL students whose ages range from 7 to 10, and grades ranging from  second to fifth grade.  The after-school program will runs for two hours. The rational for choosing this population is to reach  these students with communication disorders by utilizing a number of creative approaches in embedding ENL strategies in  music, the arts, culinary arts, dance/movement, and technology, to extend the ELL students’ literacy skills.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Technology supports, such as Boardmaker and digital cameras, are integrated into ENL and the content areas.  Multi-sensory  and multicultural materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction.  The classroom library includes a variety of books  at all levels reflecting the backgrounds, needs and strengths of ELLs.  A Balanced Literacy approach, Fundations, and Go Math  for elementary and the Everyday Math and Number Sense curriculum for middle school and high school are followed.  In the  high school, for those students ages 18 to 21, we utilize the Transition Curriculum developed by a group of P226M teachers.  Components of the Syracuse Curriculum and other resources specifically designed to address the very special needs of our  transitioning ELL students are also utilized. Content area instruction follows the Common Core Learning Standards.  Functionally based instruction is provided across the curriculum in order to foster generalization of skills and increase  independence levels. Additional ENL support is provided in areas including job sites, ADL, and community-based instruction.  Materials from FOSS and Harcourt are used in our hands-on science program. Community-based experiences, field trips, and  Adaptive Physical Education complete the program for our ELL students.                 13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our bilingual students are placed in monolingual classrooms with bilingual paraprofessionals that speak the students' native  language.  Classroom libraries include a variety of books at all levels reflecting the background and language of our ELL  students.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our students are placed in our school by the CSE; the services provided are those mandate by their IEP. Curricular materials  are adapted to the skill and age level of the student.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Technology supports, such as Boardmaker and digital cameras, are integrated into ESL and the content areas.  Multi-sensory  and multicultural materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction.  The classroom library includes a variety of books  at all levels reflecting the backgrounds, needs and strengths of ELLs.  A Balanced Literacy approach, Fundations, and Go Math  for elementary and the Everyday Math and Number Sense curriculum for middle school and high school are followed.  In the  high school, for those students ages 18 to 21, we utilize the Transition Curriculum developed by a group of P226M teachers.

Content area instruction follows the Common Core Learning Standards.  Functionally based instruction is provided across the curriculum in order to foster generalization of skills and increase  independence levels. Additional ENL support is provided in areas including job sites, ADL, and community-based instruction.  Materials from FOSS and Harcourt are used in our hands-on science program. Community-based experiences, field trips,  and  Adaptive Physical Education complete the program for our ELL students. It is not necessary for P226M to share these resources  with our co-located sites.                16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our students are placed in our school by the CSE. We provide tours for the parents and with interpretation services available  by our Parent Coordinator for Spanish-speaking parents.  For other languages we utilize other staff P226M staff members that  speak the language of the parents or we utilize the interpretation services from the DOE. The Chapter 683 summer program is  offered to newly enrolled students prior to the start of the regular school year.   The school plan for new ELL students entering  the English Language School System includes providing a nurturing environment to facilitate language production via an  experienced special education teacher and alternate placement paraprofessional that are familiar with bilingual and ENL  techniques. If it is possible, we also group students that share the same first language. This facilitates communication among  students and facilitates adaptation to the school system.

What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All of our students are second language exempt as per their IEPs.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We currently do not have a dual language program       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  P226M will provide a variety of opportunities for teachers to master the teaching strategies, curriculum practices and  behavioral approaches which address the particular needs of our ELL students.  P226M provides ongoing professional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         development to all staff, including those teachers and paraprofessionals with ELL students in their classrooms.  Due to the  needs of our students with autism, English Language Acquisition methodologies are used throughout the curriculum.  Professional Development is provided to staff in differentiated instruction and goal setting to promote student learning  according to the needs of all students, including ELLs.  In addition, all of our students receive Speech and Language Services.  The therapists work closely with and train pedagogical staff.  The primary purpose of this instruction is to promote English  language communication skills for all students including those who are ELLs.   The P226M Administrative Team also provides  Professional Development addressing the needs and specialized topics specific to ELL students.  For example, strategies that  support English Language Learners have included professional development on methodologies for language acquisition and  language instruction, standards-based instruction and assessment, emergent literacy, reading readiness and writing  procedures, and IEP writing techniques. In addition, ENL staff provides specific training to classroom teachers about pertinent  topics, strategies, and materials for ENL instruction. They also provide support to paraprofessionals on ENL techniques through  their classroom “push in” model.  The Language Allocation Policy (LAP) is collaboratively developed with the Administration  and ENL staff.  It is then explained and distributed to teachers who have ELL students in their classrooms.   Portfolios  completed by classroom teachers, Speech and Language providers, and ENL teachers demonstrate English Language  acquisition and development of communication skills.  Each portfolio compiled by ENL teachers is organized to specifically  address the needs of ELLs and related progress on their IEP goals.  P226M provides ongoing Professional Development on the  Common Core Learning Standards and how to adapt the curriculum to students with severe cognitive delays. Collaboration  between the school and the district-based ELL support coach has been established. Teachers and paraprofessionals serving  ELLs are supported through the coaching services provided by the District’s instructional coach. The coach visits the school  several times each year and trains staff in ENL techniques. Team cohorts were created for teachers, including ENL teachers, to  collaborate in the development of tasks and rubrics related to the CCLS and appropriate to the skill level of our students with  autism.             2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  We continue with the support and professional development provided  so teachers can master the teaching strategies,  curriculum practices and behavioral approaches which address the particular needs of our ELL students. We provide staff  support by encouraging attendance at District, City, and Statewide seminars focusing on the education of ELLs with severe  disabilities. We also provide ENL trainings during our full days of Professional Development to all our staff members. Most  members of our teaching staff have participated in the mandated 10 hours of Jose P. ENL staff development.  Records are kept  in the Main office with agendas and attendance records from their professional developments.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parental involvement is a key component of our school, including parents of ELLs. In addition to students' annual IEP meetings,  a variety of events are held throughout the school year to promote parental involvement. We hold parent teacher conferences  twice a year.  During this time the parents have the opportunity to visit their child's classroom and meet with the teachers,  including their ENL teacher. In addition we hold parent meetings each fall. These meetings are geared towards the specific  issues and needs of the parents, including the needs of our ELL parents, across each school site.  Aside from these individual  meetings there are many other opportunities for parental involvement.  We host monthly "Family Friday" visitations to the  classroom, Parent Association events, School Leadership Team meetings,  Art Shows, a Science Fair, and our annual Spring  Fling.  DOE translation services and funding are utilized to translate school-specific written material into the home language of  our families, to provide them with full access to all school publications and information sources.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Our school offers parents ongoing information in their home language and trainings on different aspects of their child’s  education, such as effective parent participation in school activities, home activities to support learning, assessments,  standards, and achievement of goals.  In addition to Educational Planning Conferences and Triennial Conferences at P226M,  parents, again, receive the options for Special Education English Language Learners from the school’s Parent Coordinator,  School Leadership Team meetings, semi-annual site parent meetings, school newsletters and parent-teacher conferences.  This  information is also available in the P226M Parent Handbook.  In addition, parents are involved during the Title III program. Two  Workshop sessions are provided for parents of students who participate in the Title II program. These parents are invited to  attend the instructional sessions with their child. Our ENL teacher, in collaboration with the visual arts teacher, provides direct  training to parents by modeling in the classroom with the students during the sessions of the Title III after school program, in  order to  help parents create a consistent approach to language practice by using ENL strategies at home and school. In this  way, parents can practice with their children in English and their native language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Inmaculada Jardi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P226M                                                                              School DBN: 75M226  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs we will:  a. Survey all parents regarding language needs as per the Home Language Survey completed within the first 10  days of students' admission to the Department of Education  b. Document the different languages spoken by parents as per ATS as each student is admitted to P226M  c. Require teacher consultation of Student Profile and Summary Page in SESIS prior to each IEP review.  Our Parent Coordinator engages in outreach to families regarding their need for language assistance to  communicate effectively regarding all Department of Education matters. In addition, the Alternate Placement  paraprofessionals assigned to support mandated students assist with needed translation of materials, notices,  information, etc. to families. The Department of Education translation services are utilized as needed to further  support parents' language interpretation needs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63     2.
