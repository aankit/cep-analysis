This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Bronx Collaborative High School students are academic detectives applying their research skills, analytic methods, and  critical thinking to solve real-world problems. Our students bring New York City’s unique resources and rich history  into the classroom to investigate real-world challenges. Our students produce technology and multimedia; trained to  express their voices, critically evaluate evidence, and share their own innovative ideas beyond the school’s doors.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our learning is challenging and fun. Our courses tap into students’ natural curiosity. Students learn new topics by  experimenting under the guidance of teachers; they learn by doing meaningful tasks. Students work in teams, accept  feedback from experts, and meet real-world expectations to prepare them for university and job experiences.   Our collaborations with scholars, government, community-based organizations, cultural institutions, educational  programs, and outside professionals enrich our classes, offer field trips and provide resources.   We recognize each family and student as having individual needs for support. We encourage students to develop their  myriad talents. Our counseling and guidance team support families from admission to graduation to make college  attendance and success a reality. We prize individuality, diversity, and authenticity--working together to address  issues of social justice and to create positive change in the world.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school's design and practices promote the vision championed by the Framework for Great Schools.    Rigorous Instruction- Our curriculum is highly customized and incorporates thirty-plus years of expertise on delivering  performance assessment instruction which prepares students for college-level work that captures the common-core  skill-set. As a member of the New York State Performance Standards Consortium, we are part of group of schools  approved by the New York State Department of Education to use extensive research papers in each core subject and  oral defense panels in place of Regents exams. The New York Performance Standards Consortium provides us a model  and constant professional development for engaging students in rich reading, writing, research, and oral defense  practices and demonstrate these in each discipline. In particular, we meet monthly with the other 7 Bronx Consortium  member schools to cultivate communities of practice among our respective faculties and to explore problems of  practice as a critical friends group of principals.   Supportive Environment- In accord with the vision expressed on the Framework, a central tenet of our school  throughout our six years has been the use of restorative practices and “holistic discipline” to ensure that students  experience the decency and trust. Before opening the doors in 2013, we partnered with the Morningside Center for  Teaching Social Responsibility to ensure a high-level, high-quality of restorative practices integration. Using school  funds we have maintained customized curriculum developer on-site support of the restorative practices as our school  grew to size. As a pilot school for Morningside's Rethinking Discipline initiative and with our principal as a member of  the second cohort of the Smart Schools Leadership initiative, we have engaged deeply in these practices. We have  done multiple presentations with Morningside around social justice and Culturally Responsive Education at multiple  local conferences. During the summer of 2018, we co-hosted a campus-wide restorative training with the DOE Office  of Safety and Youth Development. We continue send approximately 7 faculty per semester to formalize their Tier I  and Tier II restorative practices certification through collaborations with OYSD.   Strong Family-Community Ties- Our school deeply adopts the principle of strong family and community ties by  inviting our family and surrounding communities to participate in two significant ways. When we conduct on-site  performance assessment panels and presentations, we request that families, community organizations, and those  with specific expertise join us to help evaluate and provide feedback to students on their academic efforts. In  addition, one of our school’s central themes is to utilize the full scope of New York City (especially the Bronx) as a  space for community-based problem-based learning. We engage both our school families and our external  communities as learning opportunities, visiting city-council members and doing walking ethnographic study tours of  Bronx neighborhoods with support from community residents, activists, and leaders. We have had activists from all  over the city meet with students to further the school’s social justice theme embodied in our motto, “Solve a  problem. Change the world!”    Collaborative Teachers- From the founding of the school, our faculty have been treated as professionals and sought  for their subject-area expertise and their meaningful emotional commitments to the well-being of our students. In  creating leadership opportunities for our founding staff, many of them have continued on to serve as department   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      coordinators supporting the year two through four hires as they develop their curricular skills and find their place  within the department.    Trust- Central to our school vision is the “tone of decency and trust” which is shared by the Framework and the  Coalition. Our faculty have worked closely with parents and students to create an environment in which we treat  students like our own children — valuing their strengths and setting high standards for them to work on “their  growing edge.” From our school’s first weeks, we have empowered students through meaningful leadership  opportunities. Student government and student leadership opportunities abound, including student-led assemblies  each month.   Effective School Leadership- To embody the principles and walk the walk of a school that embodies SEL and  restorative practices, our school continues to work with the Morningside Center, the DOE, and other organizations  that address Culturally Responsive Education to explore how to deepen our school's commitment to equity,  challenging implicit bias, and solving for disproportionality. Our founding faculty and leadership teams are firmly  committed to educating Bronx students without applying “deficit-model thinking,” by offering problem-based applied  innovative coursework, strong elements of student choice, collaborative faculty design, and restorative practices. Our  strength is to provide a deeply-connected community which values students as public intellectuals and challenges  them to develop their full potential. We have been asked to speak at multiple local and national conferences about  our particular success with trauma-sensitive restorative practices in both academic and clinical arenas.    Beyond the above Framework, our school embodies central values in a central focus on democracy in education and  providing secondary education as an "essential" experience. Much of this commitment to instruction, climate, family,  and community is due to our school’s membership in the long-standing educational reform organization the Coalition  of Essential schools, whose 10 Common Principles have shaped our founding- principles of strong goals;  personalization; teacher-as-coach; mastery-based learning; a tone of decency and trust; a school-wide commitment;  resources dedicated to teaching and learning; a tone of decency and trust; and democracy in the classroom.    As we are entering our sixth year we have experienced the challenges and benefits of growing to a larger scale than  originally expected. We have continued to outreach and hire faculty who are deeply committed to treating students  as they would their own children rather than as "other people's children." With a deep commitment to the Bronx, to  problem-based learning, to technology, and to social-emotional learning, our faculty is seeking to create a great  school. Our faculty does not have a racial or ethnic majority and represents a diverse group of adults who are  reflective of the linguistic, racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of our students.    During its fifth year our school was recognized by the DOE Showcase Schools for its promising practices around  affirming student identity through student choice, individualization, restorative practices, and community-building  foundational work that had been noticed by visitors to the school. We believe these are important tools to support a  Culturally Responsive Educational learning environment.   To meet increased graduation rates, another key element of supporting the highest possible achievement for all  students, we will engage in several practices:   1) More "best practices" training/exchanges and a doubling of the Lead Advisor program, providing two trained  Advisors per grade to support their peers in a format and level of communication that drives student achievement  through collaborative family engagement. This includes increasing the number of Advisors trained in the Restorative  Practices/Community Circles model as well as providing comprehensive curricular coaching around Advisory-based  activities.   2) An increase in school-based technology moving towards 1-to-1 computing to support faculty in utilizing  instructional techniques that favor constant research and writing across all grades-- to enhance students' endurance  with completing reading and writing tasks.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      3) Enhancing the existing Advisory and guidance structures with a "House" or "Team" infrastructure that separates  the school into 3-4 guidance entities that can be engaged with healthy positive reinforcements of achievement, as  well as have incentive to provide peer mentoring, tutoring, and support within the structure to support the success of  everyone within that team.   4) Collaborate with high-quality initiatives that are aimed at supporting overall instructional coherence-- initiatives  which provide our faculty high quality training to support their Performance Based Assessment Task preparation  through common best practices. To that end, we will be participating in the Computer Science 4 All initiative with the  Department of Education. In addition, we have been selected by the College Board to participate in two innovative  programs which allow us to blend our original expertly designed curriculum and the structural coherence and  expectations of the best practices in the community of AP teachers, through engaging ALL 9th graders in the Pre-AP  curriculum in all subjects, and engaging our 10th grade in year 1 of the AP Capstone sequence through the AP Seminar  course.   5) We will also continue to work close with the Department of Education, our Superintendent's team, and the Affinity  Center to build more close ties with the NYCDOE office of college and post-secondary programs. As part of these  collaborations, we have connected with a number of cohort programs to support our own further development. Two  main areas we are focused on developing this year are to extend our Mastery Grading and College for All initiatives  into formal goal setting and change initiatives to enhance existing programs and practices and take them to the next  level. By more deeply connecting with these college and post-secondary initiatives, as well as the Computer Science  for All initiative, and AP Capstone programs we are seeking to further define and refine the college preparatory  activities that have been successfully happening in the past as a further means to encourage achievement and on- time graduation.   During the summer 2017, our school became an active member of the Mastery Collaborative as we have been  substantively building into school-wide mastery-based grading for two years, and felt ready to join a larger  community so we can begin to concretize and refine best practices around long-term implementation. As a result of  these programs success, our 2018-2019 goals include further expanding community capacity among all stakeholder  groups to generate and share community-facing documents to address frequently asked questions and core  philosophical concepts in mastery grading. We feel firmly that clearer definition and incorporation of these mastery  grading concepts in student-to-family communication will serve to anchor expectations about on-time success.   In addition, our College for All efforts during the previous school year brought off-site college visitations programs a  year earlier in the exploration sequence, connected a College Bridge program with a former graduate as a liaison for  registration and college campus connection, and a more full use of the Naviance system to support the college  application process. During the 2018-2019 school year, we have several concrete goals built from this year's assessed  needs-     expand the College Discovery curriculum into the 9th grade through a grade-wide elective course addressing   college exploration and providing a series of in-city and local area trips to college campuses-- including Ivy  League campuses     drastically increase the amount of private-scholarships that students apply for through guided workshop and      counselor follow-up opportunities to support increased attendance at private universities  further delineate a "highway to college" benchmark process through which the distributed leadership of  Advisors can help students stay up-to-date with their pre-college efforts   In addition to these academic goals, we continue to partner with the Morningside Center for Teaching Social  Responsibility to support a school-wide Restorative Practices program which has led to students feel safe and develop  social and emotional skills. Students participate in weekly Community Circles as part of their ten to fifteen student  Advisory groups. Their Advisor engages their student members of the Advisory to take personal responsibility for their  actions and academic performance, to work collaboratively as a group, and to develop an ongoing future-bound plan.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      During 2018-2019, we intend to further expand on these practices in several ways:     define Advisor responsibilities in collaboration with faculty through their PROSE voting process to name      Advising as their Administrative duties  sponsor campus-wide exploration of restorative practices through collaborative support from the Office of  Youth Support and Development     offer faculty a cohesive four-year Advisory curriculum for which they have increased professional   development consultation to support consistent implementation     enhance distributed leadership structures that allow for routinized communications around restorative   practices.   6) We use off-site experiential learning opportunities and problem-based learning in real-world contexts to further  develop students’ connections to the world beyond the school’s doors. In focusing on these skills, we prepare  students for college and career by tapping into the wide-range of expertise and showcasing students’ capacity to  achieve in all of these settings. Through partnerships with Lehman College and New York University, we extend  students’ college access on a weekly basis through free college classes at college campuses, through participation in  free weekend programs, through work with the College Advising Corps, through on-site social work, college, and  student teaching staff; and through on-site and off-site college-bound programming.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Student Populations Support      Approximately 20% of our school are students with IEPs. We have achieved meaningful success with our IEP student  population, establishing an effective student choice inclusion model which ensures IEP students the same levels of  choice of academic courses as the general student body— placing IEP teachers where students have elected to be. IEP  students at our school have higher attendance than our general education students and perform at high levels in  courses they have selected with the same course choice model as the rest of the school. Our continued work of  providing two sections of IEP options at each grade level has allowed us to engage faculty-wide exploration of the  ways to best scaffold student learning. Our school was one of six (6) to be selected by our Affinity special education  team to serve as a Model ICT Lab School for the 2016-2017 school year. In assessing IEP students’ needs, we have set  an ongoing process within the special education department of exploring the unique ways in which accommodation  and differentiation must be defined and scaffold to ensure that students can meet the high-quality standards of  Performance Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs). To support select students that also need SETTS services around  organizational and academic techniques, we hired a SETTS teacher during the 2016-2017 school year who operates a  designated SETTS space to provide the services. Our school was provided funding for the 2017-2018 school year to  have an IEP teacher engage in specialized intervention training of the team and to ensure that quality IEP writing and  practices are uniformly engaged. In addition, we have engaged a dean who has special education licensure and  training to ensure that best practices around functional behavioral assessment and sound improvement plans are  integrated as part of restorative practices rather than punitive practices.      Our ENL student population also represents approximately 20% of the student body and is served via a Transitional  Bilingual Education program at all grade levels. For the 2017-2018 school year we have tripled the size of our ENL  department to support increased push-in services to complement our range of ENL, elective, and support services.  Our student choice program is also carefully engaged to provide ENL students maximum choice of course interest; we  deploy ENL staff to courses that topically interest our ENL students to maximize engagement.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Overall School Successes      In all six broad areas of the Framework for Great Schools we have demonstrated strengths, showcasing proficiency.       We have had a number of great successes during our first five years at the school. We have continued to build a well- developed community of learners that has been recognized via School Quality Review as well as during various NYC  Department of Education officials' visits. Our school has worked well with our entire campus and we together hosted  a visit from the schools' chancellor as one of the last cohort of Campus Showcase schools. Individually, we have  worked hard to expand out success with the number      With the Class of 2018, we were successful with exponentially stronger collegiate outcomes for those who graduated- - with the Class of 2018 having been accepted to 70 different schools, with over $1 million of financial aid, and  attending a wide-range of 2-year and 4-year public colleges and universities AND private universities including several  "new ivies" like New York University and Sarah Lawrence. We worked closely with the New York City Department of  Education College 4 All initiative, including the implementation of a Bridge program.   In addition, we have been selected by the New York City Department of Education as a Showcase School beginning in  the 2018-2019 school year with a theme of Affirming Student Identity, inclusive of LBGTQ identity. Our school has had  repeated invitations to present and local and national conferences, which speaks to our clinical and educational  strength in reaching and maintaining student engagement. We have met the Framework for Great Schools  requirements for proficiency in all areas.      Our school has successfully partnered with Lehman for the College Now program sending over 125 students to college  classes in a three year period-- the vast majority of whom have completed with As and Bs.      There has also been powerful family/community choice in the school, as we have exceeded register projections for  the last four (4) school years, expanded by high school admissions beyond our original planned targets. Multiple  families have sent younger siblings, cousins, and other family friends to apply through the High School Enrollment  Process, which is the highest endorsement. The matching of over 179 students to our school for the 2018-2019 school  year and the over 1,650 applicants for our 9th grade seats speak to community and family engagement.      Our school has successfully maintained a highly effective environment of respect and rapport-- challenging students  to meet college preparatory academic standards while helping them find themselves. This is all the more impressive  as we've grown from 90 students to 570 and from 7 staff to 65. As we've expanded, we've maintained the small class  size and the small-school feeling-- keeping all students deeply connected in a loving and respectful atmosphere.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Additionally, we have built a successful program of out-of-city expeditionary learning experiences-- one per grade that  support students in developing their thinking about personal goals and social justice. Our 9th grade participates in an  environmental learning/challenge camping program, our 10th grade in multi-state college tours customized to expose  them to a range of higher education experiences, and our 11th grade in an Washington, D.C. experience meeting with  legislators and activists to better understand the mechanics of creating change.      Our key areas for focus for the 2018-2019 school year are Supportive Environment, Collaborative Teachers and Strong  Family & Community Ties.       Within the area of Supportive Environment, we are focused on two areas-- Classroom Behavior support and Peer  Support for Academic Work. With our first cohort of graduates a lower than expected four year graduation rate  showcased the need for practices that pushed students' peer-to-peer expectations and supported increased student  embodiment of professional academic commitments. With our second cohort moving toward 70% four-year  graduation rate, and out third cohort set to reach over 80%, our infused practices have already shown promise to  communicate the balance of holding high-quality expectations AND meeting students specialized learning needs. To  further support positive peer-to-peer academic encouragement, we intend to focus on:     Generate more academic student leadership opportunities like Peer Tutoring, Mentoring, and supervised   student employment     Create peer leadership roles within our new "house/team" structures to highlight student leadership and   generate positive peer challenges to increase daily student attendance, credit accumulation, pass rates, and  performance assessment success     Reengage the "Secret Circle" youth restorative leadership team to take an active part in raising awareness   around fairness and restorative practices to make peers aware of how consequences look in restorative  models   Within the area of Collaborative Teachers, our focus is to expand a highly differentiated approach to professional  development that anchors sustained, coherent initiatives and provides faculty the time to both work productively  with teachers from other schools and explore and qualify new practices and effective ideas. To do this, we intend to:      Formalize an Inter-Visitation model grounded in teacher/admin identified areas that match practice areas of  need and interest     Modify schedules to maximize opportunities and options for coordinated co-planning time    Collaboratively use the PROSE process to modify teacher contractual professional time into a format that   allows for more targeted meetings to ensure faculty-admin information exchange, inquiry team meeting, and  departmental planning while flexibly allowing for external professional development when needed.   In the area of Strong Family & Community Ties, our goals involve increasing the effectiveness of parent outreach and  solidifying increased consistent forums for parent involvement in school. To that end, we he are seeking to create  more opportunities for faculty to invite parents into their classrooms through thematic subject-area nights, trainings  and participation in performance assessment at school, exploration of curricular themes, and meaningful volunteer  opportunities. To that end, we intend to:     Provide multiple "curriculum night" programs to engage families in deep-dives of our innovative custom   designed curriculum, including the content of our exciting new collaborations with the College Board     Offer a range of College Nights that provide enhanced exploration of potential scholarships and financial   supports to make college a more achievable reality on the family decision-making level     Create a "help-a-classroom" program through which families can donate time, resources, funds, or guest   lecturing in areas of their interest and expertise   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15              Engage parents to serve as panel-members on Performance Based Assessment Tasks initiatives    Provide open classroom and academic program events where parents can learn more about STEM,   Humanities, Arts, Athletic, and Linguistic opportunities         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X351   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   553   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        During the last few years, the school has focused its goals around increased coherence across the curriculum. During  the 2015-2016 school year, a number of departments focused on developing a set of department-wide goals that  reflected the commencement. During 2016-2017, these departments focused on paring down the expansive set of  standards into a more limited and aligned pool. The departments worked within individual courses to further ensure  that each course was aligned to 5-7 specific standards. Our major implementation shift goal for 2017-2018 was  coherent Outcomes Design. Teachers across departments have gained the experience of implementing more  "modular" assessment activities, such as free-writes at the end of each chapter or article to support sense-making and  enhanced critical reading and writing skills. Coordinated assessments like these enhanced our previous goal of  increased mastery standards per week to capture the mastery activities authentically captured in that week’s two 90- minute lessons (our school is on an A/B modified block system.       During 2018-2019, we are exploring how incorporation of the College Board's AP Capstone research pedagogies and  methodology curricular design and Pre-AP practices can provide complementary support for students' integration of  these skill sets as well as increased inter-departmental coherence.      We examined our past efforts in setting our new goal:     During 2014-2015, we focused with faculty on the implementation of the Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe’s   Understanding by Design framework to ensure that teachers have planned courses in which they define their  course’s essential questions, problem statements, skills, content, assessments, and weekly/daily activities. We  did this work to improve our reflective practice and ensure that we responded to our then Superintendent  Elaine Lindsey's feedback that all classrooms at our then new school had common practices.     During 2014-2015 we also focused with faculty on the implementation of the Harvard University’s Project  Zero -- Visible Thinking Protocols as a core method for consistent student-centered instruction that would  support consistent pedagogies implemented across teachers and grades.     During the 2015-2016 school year, we focused with faculty on the development of Vertical Plans within each   department, which culminated in the launching of our school's first set of Performance Based Assessment  Task (PBAT) graduation requirements as per the NYS Assembly waiver that allows PBATs to replace Regents  exams for the Regents Diploma. In addition, that fall we involved ourselves more deeply to analyzed our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18   coursework and curricular choices against the Moderation Study of the New York Performance Standards  Consortium through our ongoing participation in this research-based assessment professional development  community.     During the 2015-2016 school year we launched the use of digital teacher development system, Teachboost,      through which teachers can see a durable representation of supervisory feedback.   From 2015-2018, we have used observational activities and teacher coaching to support implementation of a  wider range of Webb's Depth of Knowledge in pedagogical practices.             Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  We engaged in systems redesign and implemented practices during 2017-2018 that yielded significant increases in on- time completion:         Students participating in Advisory curriculum, student-led parent conferencing, and transcript analysis so that  they can better embody a sense of their on-time status  Subject teachers utilizing Google Sheets to capture academic struggles on a weekly basis and to time-line and  track senior circle graduation requirements on a week-by-week task basis.     Teacher Advisors working closely off shared data to engage families and students in a routine self-analysis and   in face-to-face problem solving opportunities to keep students on track.   Although these practices supported increases for students to meet our high academic standards, we have not yet met  our ideal goal of on-time completion at or above New York City averages-- although evidence suggests we will meet  this goal with Cohort 3-- the Class of 2019.       Our work with our first cohort of students informed deeply the practical improvements required to meet our diverse  student body's academic needs. During 2017-2018, this has meant incorporating increased student-led protocols and  processes to help students fully embody their academic requirements in ways parallel to what colleges require. This  has meant, for example, that students needed to do a self-transcript analysis to examine how their credited courses  meet state standards and identify further course choices they needed to meet all requirements. Also, students who  were in 12th grade had a formal Application for Graduation modeled after universities' "intent to graduate" through  which students had to get signatures to affirm with the appropriate departmental coordinator or counselor that the  range of credit, test, or performance assessments required of them had been met. These practices contributed to  increases in students' on-time completion.    Social and emotional learning is one of the three pillars of the school. To support our goal of engaging a school-wide  social and emotional learning plan, we have engaged in extensive school-wide planning and external collaborations.  As part of being steadfast in our resolve to innovative restorative practices and holistic discipline we have engaged in  ongoing critical needs assessment, and done so under the guidance of the Morningside Center for Teaching Social  Responsible, who are in turn reviewed by the nationally-recognized SEL research entity CASEL, and who as an agency  document their own efficacy in collaboration through Metis Associates.   In reviewing our past efforts to help plan this year's goal, we noted the following:     During the 2013-2014 school year, Principal Schneider was a member of Cohort 2 of the Smart Schools   leaders and the Principal and Assistant Principal were invited to present workshops at the organization's  Courageous Schools conference   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22        During the 2014-2015 school year and the 2015-2016 school years, we participated in the Rethinking   Discipline pilot, through which our school documented and rolled-out within our student community an array  of restorative practices including the incorporation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 OSYD trainings.     During the 2015-2016 school year we successfully launched a student-led restorative practices/holistic  discipline leadership group-- The Secret Circle-- who has written and served as circle keeper for original  materials on self-image, discrimination, peer violence, etc.   Students school-wide reviewed and commented on our restorative policies.      Our school’s strengths regarding this goal are a clear record of creating a safe and rigorous learning environment for  students during the school’s first five years. Student’s reporting through Advisory surveys and to student government  leadership is that they have embraced the safe climate of the school-- persistently commenting on the rarity of  physical fights, physical aggression, or verbal aggression.   Upon noting students' concerns of the need for increased peer-to-peer communication of expectation to embody  rules and academic success, we have discussed with our School Leadership Team during Spring 2018 meetings the  model of implementing a "house" or "team" structure to further build positive peer-incentives for leadership and  academic achievement.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school has been committed from its earliest days to teacher development and to do so has created a climate of  open door classrooms and encouraged visits from external educational entities and NYCDOE staff. Our community of  teachers has volunteered much time to participate in steering and leadership activities, staff-wide hiring committees,  and other distributed leadership activities. Our faculty applied alongside administration to join PROSE and has made  successfully innovations around teacher evaluation, mastery-based grading, student choice/innovative programming,  and internships.   We see teacher professional development as the central "collaborative teachers" experience because it is so central  to shaping a coherent discourse which students and families can feel empowered to join because it “makes sense.”  Our overall work this year is to utilize professional development, collaborative planning, and community-wide events  to develop a school-wide transparent understanding of Mastery/Competency-based grading among all stakeholder  groups. To that end, we envision engaging faculty in PD around key elements of Mastery-based learning discourse so  that they can then fine-tune their practices around this discourse through the existing Critical Friends structures  within our learning community.      In our lead-in to mastery practices during the past two years, faculty have identified that they need a lot more  support on the “how to” elements of working with students and parents around discussing mastery and  leveraging these discussions into actual improved achievement. To meet these needs, our PD plan includes  (but is not limited to) engaging in the following sessions so that faculty can take ownership of the student-led  mastery discussions from administration by Spring 2019.     PD Session 1: Walking the Walk- This PD session will rely on interdisciplinary table work as faculty (guidance   and teachers) role play dialogues with students and families so they can “norm” their communication and  mastery and test out approaches for engaging and leveraging others to take action for improvement.     PD Session 2: Talking the Talk- Faculty will collaboratively draft and share written documents, Advisory   lessons, and visual aids which they believe can be used across classrooms to provide consistency and guidance  in understanding mastery-based grading evaluations, the continuum of detail embedded in them, the  common school-wide language, and the implications students should expect when they see such evaluations.    PD Session 3: Preparing Students to Drive- This PD will focus on existing models of student-led conferencing   and explore the concrete ways in which our school can prepare students to organize and lead the Student-Led  Mastery Conferencing mentioned elsewhere in our 2018-2019 annual goals.   In setting our current goal, we reviewed past work which includes:     Creating a teacher-led Scheduling Team that moderates faculty preferences and student needs and has  greatly expanded their work from 2013-2014 with the incorporation and fine-tuning of a student-choice  course process in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016     Presenting at the November 2014 Fall Forum conference on instructional design practices we had engaged in   during the creation of the school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26         Identifying a group of Departmental Coordinators who work to ensure high-quality standards are discussed  and integrated in departmental committee work, as expressed through the Vertical Plans developed during  2015-2016.     Collaborated on school-wide problem solving on a weekly basis during all three school years through  representation on the Steering & UFT Consultancy Committee- a weekly meeting among faculty and  administration.   We have previously in this document identified that participation in Critical Friends Groups or Critical Pedagogy Pairs  are a key part of our vision toward peer accountability around establishing and maintaining rigorous instruction.   Our SLT sees relevance in setting an additional goal around how collaborative teachers at our school can establish and  maintain a distributed leadership model that expands the reach of school programs, activities, and communal self- evaluation.

During the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years, our school continued to be recognized via the 2016-2017 Quality  Review and 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 PPO reviews as having proficient or well-developed leadership around the  development of climate and culture as well as innovative use of resources. Our visits from external DOE individuals  have identified myriad ways in which the school has been solidly good and consistent in its existing innovations and  through which the school can push toward greatness in these areas. For the 2018-2019 school year and two following,  we have been selected as a Showcase School by the DOE on the basis of our strengths in affirming student identities  for all, including LBGTQ students and setting high expectations for all.   Despite the clear messaging, a recent survey of the school community since its expansion in size has reflected a  slightly more diffuse consistent communication of the key practices of our vision across all classrooms and peer-to- peer conversations as well as showcased lower-than-expected on time graduation rates. To effectively anchor  increased on-time graduation rates and pass rates, our school leadership and extended leadership team have  identified the need to establish clearer routines , increased faculty ownership of student achievement, and consistent  structures for our entire faculty to review and take action on struggling students' needs.

Bronx Collaborative is deeply committed to social justice, restorative practices, and culturally responsive education.  During the first four years of our school, we have particularly focused on Active Teaching Methods, Reshaping the  Curriculum and Delivery of Services, and Small Group Instruction. We have done this through our commitment to  Problem-Based Learning and the inclusion of student voice initiatives in all of our operational design. Students worked  closely with faculty to develop a “student choice” system modeled after college in which students take initial “intro”  courses in each department and then choose core classes from a bulletin of possible and often multi-grade offerings  that tailor to the intersection of student interest and teacher expertise.   During the 2017-2018 school year we doubled our parent participation by utilizing Student-Led Conferencing as a  model to engage the Communication of High Expectations, the Inclusion of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse  Students, and Student-Controlled Discourse. We feel that this goal is a high-leverage model to bring in Family as  Learning Partners in a relationship in which students are supported as the “driver” or change agent. We find that too  often students feel they are being tattled on by faculty for failing to meet their obligations during parent conferences.  Students will often not even be present during the process.    As a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools and the NY Performance Standards Consortium, our school has  always been deeply committed to rigorous student-centered and culturally responsive learning. The 10th Coalition  principle—democracy in the classroom— is central to how we have developed the school. Youth voice has helped  shape our “student choice” based course schedule, modified A/B schedule, and diverse course offerings. To support  students in empowering themselves as public intellectuals, we introduce all incoming 9th graders to our Habits of  Work (Problem Solving, Media Literacy, Civic Participation, Social Justice, Support & Perseverance, Social & Emotional  Learning, and Excellence).    As we converted to school-wide mastery grading during 2016-2017, many families wanted to better understand the  impacts, the outcomes, and how the system would help or hinder students’ understanding of where they stand and  preparation for college options. We truly believe that this goal will have students take increased responsibility to  understand the mastery grading approach so they can feel confident in serving as a translation bridge during the  conferencing. In starting early through Advisory and classes, we will provide modeling around discussing mastery so  that students can take over the discourse and communicate key questions and concerns they want answered to help  them meet the conferencing goals.   Our school-leadership team and parents’ association have been successful during the last two school years in  engaging in high-level planning work, appointment of administration through C-30 processes, Title 1 School Wide  Programs applications, and other major initiatives. At the same time, parent leadership have found tremendous  difficulty in sustaining attendance and participation in face-to-face models given 92%+ of the school being Title 1  Eligible. As a result they have recommended we establish more effective and consistent communication systems built  around sharing the specifics of time/date/format of students' key academic requirements.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Our school engages in recruitment of high-quality teachers through our effective partner relationships with New York  University and Lehman College and through our long-term hiring and informational exchange with other local CUNY  and private schools like Columbia University. We participate at local university’s teacher fairs, such as Manhattan  College. Additionally, we outreach through the New York Performance Standards Consortium which provides access  to a wealth of educators trained in our performance-assessment model. Our outreach for new teachers for the 2015- 2016 school year yielded a number of teachers with between 6 and 12 years experience teaching.   To provide connection to other high quality educational programs, we engage our faculty in professional development  both on-site and at local and national conferences. A number of our faculty presented at the national Coalition of  Essential School’s Fall Forum 2015. In addition, our faculty participation in physical education, math, science, history,  and English PD off-site. Our faculty routinely takes place in PD activities with local performance assessment      Our school won a competitive program development grant to work with Facing History and Ourselves around social  studies curriculum development.   To create a high-quality atmosphere on-site for professional development, our faculty voted to use the DOE’s contract  time to merge Professional Development and Inquiry activities into a weekly “Staff Meeting” through which we can  teacher practice.   In addition, our faculty have elected to be part of the first cohort of PROSE schools who are innovating the UFT  contract elements to ensure the development of an innovative learning community-- which we jointly believe is key to  long-term retention and sustainability.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Bronx Collaborative High School is a member of the New York Performance Standards Consortium, an organization  recognized by the New York City Department of Education through the formation of an affinity group. The Consortium  has spent the last 20 years developing and refining high-quality professional development around instruction and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      assessment. For 20 years, the Consortium’s focus has been on the research, critical reading, critical writing,  presentation, and debate skills that are central to the Common Core State Standards even before the CCSS were  developed. The teacher moves that are part of CCSS are already ingrained into the professional development  practices which are shared across a wide range of teachers through teach Consortium days, inter-visitation, and  Summer Clinic sessions. In addition we participate in an annual Moderation study in which assessment tools and  grading professional development activities occur. These activities provided a constant stream of professional  development for teachers around the teaching and assessment practices central to our school.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Not Applicable        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Faculty write their own curriculum that are aligned to the completion of the New York State approved Regents  alternative Performance Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs). Teachers participate in the Moderation activity studies  through which inter-rater reliability is maintained across members of the Consortium of performance-assessment  schools.    In each class, teachers have created unit projects to serve as Interim Assessments to provide multiple and ongoing  measures of student learning, and to provide formative assessment to students and their families. This model has  been long tested and refined at our sister school, the Institute for Collaborative Education. Based on effective   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      standing best practices at that program, our faculty participate in Looking At Student Work and Looking at Teacher  Work protocols to study their own Interim Assessment Course Unit Projects and examine their alignment.   Bronx Collaborative uses Fred Newman’s research regarding the alignment of authentic assessment projects,  authentic instruction, and authentic student tasks. We apply Newman’s framework as a protocol model to support  teachers in making assessment revisions and improvements to ensure maximum instructional effect.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bronx Collaborative, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  ESSA Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and  support of student achievement between the school and the families.      The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Bronx Collaborative will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      · providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   · providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   · fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      · providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   · sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   · providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      · actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

In grade 12, there are 14 students whose proficiency level is Entering and 4 students whose  proficiency level is Transitioning.  All of these students have demonstrated a challenge in  meeting on-time PBAT projects and are overdue in meeting the English Regents exam  requirements.  For these twenty-six (26) students, we believe this supplemental program will provide  exponential benefits to anchor the work they are doing during the regular school day in their  ELA and ENL classes.  We will be targeting these students' specific language acquisition and  support needs for successful completion of Performance Based  Assessment Tasks and English  Regents exam graduation requirements.   An ESL teacher and a Bilingual Special Educator will  meet with the identified students up to 4 hours per week through after-school and/or Saturday  Academy hours starting mid-November (immediately after first grades are issued), until the last  week of June before the Regents/ Assessment week.   To supplement students' regular school day support programming around this, we intend to  create a weekly supplemental program - el Proyecto Prodigio.  The model of this after-school  supplemental program is to engage students around the specific interventions and supports they  need beyond the school-day classroom in order to showcase their full intellectual power through  a completed set of panels and projects.  Two instructors (one ENL trained and one Bilingual Special Education trained) will hold  alternating after-school hours each week to enable students to find four (4) hours per week of  supported time-- with a vision that 4 extra hours of supportive intervention per week will yield  120 more hours a year-- which will add a supplemental form of support that serves comparably  to the participants covering an entire additional course-worth of support practices per semester  outside of the regular school day.   Even though they are not taking this program for credit, it is of intellectually rich character in  supporting students' increased linguistic independence in project-completion.  After school and  Saturday Supplemental Direct Instruction: to accelerate English language proficiency in the four  modalities of language-reading, writing, speaking and listening.  This supplemental instruction  will support students additional after-school opportunities to be engaged in group and individual  reading and writing, Socratic discussions and presentations.  A major goal of this supplementary  instruction is to support mastery of the writing and speaking demands of the PBATs they must  complete and present in order to graduate as well as the reading and writing demands of the  ELA Regents.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   All of the afterschool curricular supports rely on Bronx Collaborative teachers' self-created  materials that are tied to existing well-developed curriculum. They incorporate multimedia  source materials from other educational institutions (colleges, libraries, archives, documentaries)  through the use of Smartboards, laptops and/or iPads.  As such, the teachers leading this  supplemental instructional intervention will develop customized, language-rich materials  consistent with core instruction strategies and methods.  Academic and attendance records will be recorded in Jumprope (our grading software)  and Excel/Google Sheets. The guidance counselors who cover these respective grades will  outreach to students around their continued participation and will email and call parents in  preferred languages to address any academic attendance issues.  The teachers may choose to engage select students in completing 40-50 hours of Reading Plus(an  enrichment reading program): Within the aforementioned supplementary instructional program,  students will have time to practice reading comprehension skills through this online  reading program, which is designed to simultaneously build reading stamina.  Because students  will have individual accounts and access to this program, they will have the added benefit of  practicing reading at home and on weekends.  The instructors will have administrative power to  monitor their regular use of the program and guide their progress.  This will be a supplementary  portion of their core ELA classroom instruction.  We believe funding these supplemental after-school/Saturday program supports will allow for a  safe, highly supported small environment for upperclassmen ENL students on the lowest and  mid-range proficiency levels, beyond the basic support options funded on Fair Student Funding  and/or Title 1 SWP.  Our rationale for this program activity is to use Title III funds to provide  direct instruction support in a smaller ratio through the use of an intimate after-school setting,  where ENL and trained learning specialists support students directly on project completion and  Regents prep.   Our school already funds additional types of after-school support with non-Title II funds;  however we are applying the majority of the Title III monies to direct instructional through per  session for a customized ENL-only tutoring program to ensure students in grades 11 and 12 (our  two oldest grades) are able to meet project and testing graduation requirements in a timely way.   rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             We run a wide-range of professional development programs at our school at no cost to Title III  that offer the ENL faculty and general faculty training in ENL areas.  To avoid one-shot or  limited PD, we work with other schools with English Language Learner populations to showcase  their best practices.  More specifically, we engage in inter-visitation to the other performance- based Consortium members of the Internationals Network to explore their best practices around  supporting students through a Performance Based Assessment Task (PBAT) process.  We fund our ENL staff to engage in inter-visitation though funding their substitute teachers and  prep-coverage as needed to visit a wide range of program activities. This ensures that over 50%  of the ENL faculties' PD time is focused specifically on ENL needs.  This allows both inter- visitation and participation in district-wide Consortium PD and planning around ENL supports   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Part C: Professional Development   and services.

A welcome orientation will be offered in  November to engage the parents of participants to understand how each student is expected to  meet at least four (4) hours per week of direct support through opting into the approximately 6-8  hours of service weekly.  To support increased parent engagement and increased achievement for English Language  Learners- we are utilizing school translation funding at no cost to the Title III LEP funding to  support this outreach event through food and/or specialized translators.    The meeting agenda will cover ELL student achievement PBAT graduation requirements, use of  our grading software to track student class success, and NYS state graduation requirements like  the ELA Regents. Our parent outreach in advance of this event will consist of mail home form  letters, school messenger robo-calls, Advisor emails, and grade level Guidance Counselor  meetings and contact to maximize parent participation at this orientation event.   We intend to fund the Big Word to provider translation services for this program orientation, and  to engage parents to attend further programs-- PTA meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences,  Performance Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs) Evaluator Panel trainings, New Family  Orientation, College Night, Family Math Night, Family English Language Arts Night, and  Family Spanish Night.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As a high school, Bronx Collaborative makes use of the results of the NYSITELL in combination with existing standardized  testing to get a baseline idea of students' literacy levels.  As a project-based school that focuses on multi-layered assessment  rather than traditional testing, we heavily use teacher-created assessments to engage in a deeper process of assessing  students' literacy skills and determining  instructional activities that provide the greatest levels of support.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school looks at three sets of data to evaluate our program for ELL students.  First, we review the data provided by  students' performance on the NYSESLAT in assessing our students' progression toward meeting proficiency targets in our  program. Second, our faculty assess the data regarding the ELL students' performance in their academic classes. Third, we  analyze the qualitative data on our ELL students' progress to meet the Performance Based Assessment Tasks (PBATS), a state- approved Regents alternative for our school, to assess students' progression toward graduation requirements.  Like our entire  student body, the ELL students must complete annotated research work and pass an oral defense panel during their 11th and  12th grade school years in each core discipline subject content area.  Our school has developed both Mini-PBAT panels for 9th  and 10th grade, an Interim Assessment Projects that occur on a quarterly basis in each course.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school is not an elementary school and therefore is not teaching within the RTI framework.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our review of data, shows that students who have spent a year or two in our TBE program have been successful with moving  across performance levels toward proficiency-- with seven (7) students recently achieving a commanding level and shifting into  the post-proficiency services.  In addition, 4 students moved from Intermediate to Expanding and 2 students who were labeled  as advanced are in the expanding proficiency level.  The transitioning proficiency level has the most diverse group of students  who were previously tested and were labeled as beginning, intermediate and advanced.  The majority of entering students at  all grade levels have been in the country for less than 2 years.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Following the CR Part-154-2 delination of instructional minutes per program model, we have arranged a series of  appropriate courses.  Our English Language Arts teacher team-teaches with our ESOL teacher to provide ENL/ELA  programming for ELL students.  In addition our ESOL teachers provide stand alone ENL coursework for Entering and  Emerging students. In addition, we provide specialized supplemental coursework with ESOL teachers to meet the  Flexible scheduled portion of CR Part 154-2, through standalone coursework. At our school, all students are in  ungraded classes and engage in "student choice" of their coursework.  For freestanding ENL students, there is an  Advisement requirement to select the appropriate integrated ELA/ENL and stand alone-ENL courses.  There are  heterogenous groupings in these courses to maximize teacher capacity and to ensure that students in our ENL  program have a range of courses in other subjects to select from that are not limited by their ENL requirements.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Following the CR Part-154-2 delination of instructional minutes per program model, we have arranged a series of  appropriate courses.  Our English Language Arts teacher team-teaches with our ESOL teacher to provide ENL/ELA  programming for ELL students.  In addition our ESOL teachers provide stand alone ENL coursework for Entering and  Emerging students. In addition, we provide specialized supplemental coursework with ESOL teachers to meet the  Flexible scheduled portion of CR Part 154-2, through standalone coursework. At our school, all students are in  ungraded classes and engage in "student choice" of their coursework.  For Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE)  students, there is an Advisement requirement to select the appropriate integrated ELA/ENL and stand alone-ENL  courses, as well as a Home Language Spanish course on Level 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate to past performance and  coursework in Spanish.  Additionally, students are directed the course choice options for subject content areas that  have bilingual teachers. There are heterogenous groupings of proficiency levels in all courses to maximize teacher  capacity and to ensure that students in our ENL program have a range of courses in other subjects to select from that  are not limited by their ENL requirements.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Our school does not offer a Dual Language Instruction program.:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 Following the CR Part-154-2 delination of instructional minutes per program model, we have arranged a series  of appropriate courses.  Our English Language Arts teacher team-teaches with our ESOL teacher to provide ENL/ELA  programming for ELL students.  In addition our ESOL teachers provide two standalone (using the flexible option on the second)  courses and one integrated ENL/ELA course program to provide Entering students their 360 minutes of support.    Emerging  students are directed to a 180 minute integrated and 180 minute standalone/flexible ENL coursework for Entering and  Emerging students. Transitioning students are enrolled in 180 minutes of an integrated ENL/ELA course. Expanding students  selet an integrated model180 minute per week course.  Additionally, students are enrolled in a home language arts class  totaling 180 minutes. The bilingual course for TBE students options is history.  Our LOTE teacher with extensive experience  teaching Spanish home language students, provide three-tiers of home language arts instruction for all spanish-speaking  students. Students are enrolled in a home language arts class totaling 180 minutes.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   For freestanding ENL students and Transitional Bilingual Education students, core content is provided through a  student-centered pedagogy that was developed over 30 years ago to meet what are now called Common Core Learning  standards.  Our school was recognized by the NYC Department of Education via membership in the Affinity Group for  Perfomrance Standards Consortium and Internationals high schools, a district that focuses heavily on language development  and CCLS.  Through inter-visitation and showcase activities, we collaborate on innovative instructional approaches.  For TBE  students, these approaches include bilingual educators innovatively presenting the content work in Spanish and English.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   Our Spanish and ESOL staff evaluate student's understanding of all content areas through student-facilitated  discussions in Spanish class, and our Advisories in which bilingual staff engage students in academic goal setting and student  conferencing.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A.  Our focus with SIFE students is to differentiate instruction with special scaffolding (graphic organizers, re-teaching of  material, supplemental graphic documents, etc.) to bridge learning content they may have missed. All eligible ENL students are  given testing accommodations that include: a separate location, time and a half, bilingual dictionaries (excepting ELA exam)  and third reading of listening section (ELA only).  B. To support Newcomer learning, our ELL content areas focus on providing extensive home language instructional support  and locate supplemental materials in students' home language. All eligible ENL students are given testing accommodations  that include: a separate location, time and a half, bilingual dictionaries (excepting ELA exam) and third reading of listening  section (ELA only).  C. Developing students receive differentiated support through scaffolds that bridge their CALP and BICS language skills,  supporting them at achieving higher levels of independent academic writing. All eligivle ENL students are given testing  accommodations that include: a separate location, time and a half, bilingual dictionaries (excepting ELA exam) and third  reading of listening section (ELA only).  D. Long Term ELLs receive additional support from a combination of ESOL, ELA, subject-content, and learning specialists to  identify the additional skills and support they need to become proficient. These students too receive testing accommodations  that include: a separate location, time and a half, bilingual dictionaries (excepting ELA exam) and third reading of listening  section (ELA only).  E.  Former ELLs receive differentiated support to assist them in meeting graduation requirement performance based  assessment tasks (PBATs).  Each semester they choose (with advisor and ESOL coordinator consultation) choose either a full- course or .5 elective with integrated teaching model.  These students receive testing accomodations that include: a separate  locations, time and a half and third reading of listening section (ELA only).     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Bronx Collaborative utilizes the instructional strategy of problem-based learning in which a teacher provides a hands-on  student inquiry driven experience, through which they coach the students to create a product that represents their learning.  To support the ELL-SWD students, and all students, we engage teachers to create original handouts for each course at each  grade level- cognitive "scaffolding" documents-- that provide graphic organizers, visual tools and conceptual imagery, and key  terms/concepts and ideas.  This serves as a best practice to ensure ELL-SWD have academic content area support and further  accelerate their English language learning around academic vocabulary and writing skills.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school is a PROSE school that has worked closely with its student government leadership to develop a schedule that allows  students the highest levels of "student choice" around their coursework.  To ensure ELL-SWD students maintain this level of  choice, IEP teachers are assigned to courses based on students' pre-identification of their academic interests.  Additionally,  80% of our IEP teachers providing ICT services are bilingual Spanish, matching our TBE program.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  To support ELLs in their ELA, Math, Science, and History content areas, we have targeted the ELL subgroup of 10th and 11th  grade students who are in the Entering and Emerging categories.  We have focused our targeted intervention in three  areas-  1) providing PM school coursework (pro-rata) to ensure students can remediate past credit issues  2) providing after- school tutoring and support to assist students with current content area challenges  3) providing a Saturday school help  program to support students with meeting current graduation requirements and preparing for PBAT activities.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, we are hoping to develop an independent reading program to supplement ELL students'  classroom academic reading.  In addition, based on expressed interest, we are seeking to host ELL Family programming,  providing linguistic and technology classes.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not identified any services for ELLs that we are planning to discontinue.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students in our school participate in "student choice" through which they are able to make program requests for thematic  courses that align to their interests.  Students receiving ELL programming participate in select courses mandated on their  program by their proficiency level, but have "student choice" in all other courses. Student requests for all students are  reviewed by their Advisor, who provides the student one-on-one counseling regarding the courses.  ELL students in the TBE  program are made aware of their program requirements to participate in some subject-content classwork with bilingual  educators, but are provided support in ensuring they meet the maximum number of student choice courses.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support ELLs, our school has purchased a range of supportive materials like translation dictionaries for instructional and  assessment use, iPad technology for reading programs, laptop and SmartBoard technology for visual learning support.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All students whose home language is Spanish, in our TBE program receive Home Language Spanish at one of the three levels in  which it is offered.  Students who have other home languages, take Spanish or Japanese as part of our Foreign Language  Learner program at one of three levels.  Our ENL students have a choice of Spanish or Japanese.  Select Home Language  Spanish students are able to take additional coursework as part of the College Now program. Our school does not offer a Dual  Language Program.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our school operates as an ungraded or multi-grade classroom.  After one semester of mandatory introductory classwork, all  students including ELLs are able to select course with advisement which match their interests and needs.  As a result we are  able to most effectively ensure that services and resources are provided to students that respond to their age and instructional  neeeds.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    To support ELLs, our school has purchased a range of supportive materials like translation dictionaries for instructional and  assessment use, iPad technology for reading programs, laptop and SmartBoard technology for visual learning support.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are engaged by our parent coordinator during the summer preceding their start to obtain effective  communication points of contact and to engage them in an on-site family orientation event.  Our ESOL coordinator and our  bilingual faculty participate in the orientation events to provide an additional opportunity to assess family and student  language needs.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    English Language learners are able to take either Home Language Spanish or Foreign Language Learner Japanese courses.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Our school does not offer a Dual Language program.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our professional development plan for all ESOL personnel at the school to provide them extensive ELL focused PD, involves a  combination of off-site professional development at local and national ESOL conferences and particpation in inter-visitation  with other members of our Consortium/Affinity Schools Performance Consortium & Internationals High School district of  which we are a part.  Staff in all content areas gets ongoing professional development (amounting to 15% of the professional  development time) from a combination of our principal, ESOL coordinator, NY Performance Standards Consortium staff and  partners from Columbia University during our weekly professional development on Mondays, at the rate of once monthly with  additional hours from  teacher visitation day activities organized by the New York Performance Standards Consortium on  November 12 and November 17, will participate in a whole day PD organized by the NY Performance Standards Consortium on  February 1, 2016 and the spring teacher visitation days scheduled for March 2016.         Our participation in the Affinity Schools Performance Consortium & Internationals High School district affords us an ongoing  highly specific set of PD around Common Core Learning Standards, as cross-walked, taught and tested in our Performance  Based Assessment Task papers and oral defense presentations.  This wide range of professional development around the skill- set found in the Common Core Learning Standards, is most appropriate because the International schools in our district have  refined working with ELL students on these PBAT skills over a twenty year period as part of our Regents' Waiver.  By utilizing  inter-visitation and collaborative planning with this range of schools who have served ELLs with specialized suport for these  learning standards, provides our faculty high-quality professional development.     Teachers of ELLs get additional ongoing professional development from our partners at Colombia University, the Affinity  Schools Performance Consortium. Our partners at Columbia University offer additonal professional development hours to our  teachers of ELLs at our school. Additionally, our teachers of ELLs have participated with our ESOL teachers in the teacher  visitation days organized by the New York Performance Standards Consortium on November 12th and 17th and will participate  in the February 1, 2016 PD and the teacher visitation days scheduled for March 2016.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school provides faculty a comprehensive Social and Emotional Learning curriculum that has been customized through a  collaboration with the Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility.  This curriculum focuses heavily on supporting  students as they adjust to high school by focusing on building a sense of community and increasing personal responsibility.  We document the weekly "staff meeting" PD activites described above through our Google drive collection of  PD  materials.  These weekly mandatory Monday sessions provide the opportunity for 15 % of the time to be spent on ELL- specific programming that is kept in digital presentation format for staff to use as an ongoing tool.   We document the ELL  instructors' progress toward the 50% time goal by logging their inver-visitations and participation in high-quality off-site PD  along with their direct work with suprevisors around developing the stafff-wide presentations.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During the spring semester, our school will be hosting a series of one-on-one family meetings that are "student led  conferences," following a school designed protocol to help parents meet the current mandates for annual meetings and  explore the path for continued entitlement and services.  These are in addition to the DOE-scheduled parent teacher  conferences.  The ESOL coordinator will be tasked with working with ELLs to include discussion of language delevlopment  progress, language proficiency assessment results in all content areas. In addition, the ESOL coordiantor will work with the  DOE interpretation unit to provide interpretation services for parents whose preferred language is not Spanish (which she  herself can translate).      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our school has a history of ELL parent participation in PTA executive board and School Leadership Team meetings, with  translation provided as needed to support parent participation.  In addition, our parent coordinator works with our ESOL team  to provide events cusotmized for ELL parents.  Also, many of our ELL parents are engaged to serve as panel evaluators for our  Spanish language Performance Based Assessment Task (PBAT) panels, during which they serve as the native speaker evaluator  to assess language learner's skills and defense of their work.     During these next two years, we will offer family ENL special  classes as well as sessions to support parents in utiizing our school's grading software and parent training sessions as schoolto  to recruit and train parents for sitting on both Spanish-language and English-language PBAT panels as evaluators.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brett Schneider, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Collaborative High Schoo                                                                              School DBN: 10x351  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration, our Translation and Language team, including our ESOL teachers, Parent Coordinator, and  school secretaries engage in a structured outreach process to achieve verbal and written communication with all  families. In addition to our use of the DOE Emergency Contact "blue cards" which we have supplemented with  additional questions, we also engage families to participate in the Home Language Identification Survey and  review the RAPL and UPPG. Our secretarial team and assistant principals work with our ENL coordinator to review  ATS attributes, including any existing entries on the ATS reports including the RPOB geographic code and home  language code.    The HLIS, ATS reports, and Student Emergency Contact cards establish Spanish as our super-majority Translation  and Interpretation area of need. We have organized our hiring process around this. Currently, both secretaries  and our Parent Coordinator are bilingual Spanish speakers. In addition, over 50% of our teaching faculty is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      bilingual. Additionally, one of our faculty members is a bilingual Arabic speaker, who provides language services  support for the approximately 2-4 families needing these services in an average school year at our site.    Whether or not the parents of students express a comfort in English, we maintain copies of key douments in  multiple languages to meet all our families' home language needs. In addition , we have also reviewed procedures  for using the DOE translation unit services and in house services to support getting translation materials and  shared these with our faculty.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Following each city-wide DOE family event, the school T&I planning team reviews quantiative participation and  attendance data regarding parents with T&I needs. In addition, the team contacts a small sample of families for a  more in-depth qualitative interviw engaging T&I services to conduct the outreach and conversation. We also  administer a parent survey in the parents' preferred language to ask a series of questions to determine family's  knowledge, comfort, usage, and further needs regarding our T&I services.
