This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            The mission of the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science (AMS) is to prepare all of our students to  become compassionate, critical thinkers capable of successful pursuits after high school. We expect that our  graduates will be well-prepared for college study and that they will be equipped with the skills to make solid career   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      choices. From individual and group explorations into math and science-based projects to dynamic internships, our  school will be simultaneously compelling, rigorous, supportive, relevant, and fun. We believe that as young people  attempt to make sense of the world around them, they are led quite naturally to mathematics, and that math can  therefore be a powerful, unifying tool for learning. We further believe that all disciplines should be explored in an  engaging manner that asks students to consider the real-life applications of their work, and that all students are  entitled to a rich, college-prep education.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science (AMS) is a small school in the Bronx serving over six  hundred students in grades six through twelve. The school was founded in 2004, “phased in” for several years, and  has now graduated six classes of high school seniors.   AMS is located in District 9 and is part of the Urban Assembly Affinity Group, which seeks to provide a college- preparatory education to students in all communities. AMS is a non-screened school, and we are extremely proud of  our school population, which includes approximately 28.5% students with Special Needs, 13% English Language  Learners, and students with a wide range of backgrounds and achievement levels. Most of our students live in the  Morrisania neighborhood in the Bronx, and we are proud to serve the families in our community.   During the fourteen years since AMS was founded, the school has earned successful achievement results in most  areas. AMS has had a cumulative graduation rate of approximately 90% for the past seven years, and has earned  among the highest possible ratings on NYC DOE Progress Reports and Quality Reviews. (See School Quality Guide,  2015-16 and Quality Review report 2016, indicating 88% 4-year graduation rate each of the past two years, and "Well  Developed" rating in almost all categories.) All of the AMS Quality Reviews have consistently expressed strong support  for AMS’s focus on teacher collaboration, with a well-developed system of “team planning” for all instructional teams  from grades six through twelve. This focus on collaboration helps create a consistent and clear view of instruction that  focuses on engaging and relevant student work.   We also believe that students benefit from a rich and varied set of experiences during their adolescence, and we hope  that our school can “fill the gap” in after-school programming available in this neighborhood. Our community is  under-served, and we strive to provide a wide range of programming (during school, after school, on Saturdays and  over the summer) in academics, enrichment, sports and the arts. Many of our current school initiatives fall into these  areas. This year, AMS is part of the Middle School Quality Initiative and the New York State Extended Learning Time  grant program. Both of these programs provide extensions to our school programming to provide additional reading  time, after school programs, and extensive art programming. AMS also participated in the DOE’s Summer Quest and  Summer in the City programs, allowing AMS to provide a middle school summer enrichment program for five weeks,  open to all students in grades six through eight.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   AMS has a wonderful student population that is diverse and representative of our community. Approximately 28.5%  of our students have disabilities (including physical disabilities, learning disabilities, etc.) and approximately 13% of  our students are classified as English Language Learners. AMS is committed to providing the highest quality education  to all students, providing whatever accommodations they need to thrive in school and in their post-secondary  pursuits.    For students with disabilities, we provide a wide range of extra supports, including smaller classes, team teaching,  extra help (resource room, push-in help, paraprofessionals, tutoring and after school), in addition to a wide range of  additional supports. For English Language Learners, we provide all the extra help and supports that any student  receives within classrooms as needed, in addition to extra support provided in small ESL classes and with an extra   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      teacher in the classroom. Our school also provides a wide range of extra programming to support our Title I students-- including after school programs, trips, Saturday programs and summer programming.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The AMS leadership believes the school has made strong progress this year in several areas of the Framework for  Great Schools. Our school’s strengths (over the past few years especially) are clearest in the areas of academic rigor  and in collaborative teachers. Our school is proud of the seven-year sequence of project-centered math instruction  and the achievement results that have followed. We also have a system of collaborative planning for all core  academic teachers, which is a central structure of our school. All teachers are members of collaborative teams that  work together to share all lessons—and this structure provides mentoring for new teachers, support for curriculum  development and professional development, all in a single, supportive system of collaboration. The progress is  evident in the school survey results from 2017-18, demonstrating high rates of satisfaction in the area of rigorous  instruction and teacher collaboration (4.05 & 4.03 respectively).    Last year (during the 2017-18 school year), AMS also made progress in the area of “supportive environment” (from a  2.62 in 2017 to a 3.35 in 2018). The school continued its emphasis and development in this area--for example, we  used the citywide Monday staff development meetings to focus on training our teachers on effective advisory  practices; and continued to expand our summer programs (enrichment programming open to all middle school  students and innovative programs for at-risk high school students). This progress is evident in successful improvement  in student attendance and in the relevant portions of the school surveys.   In 2018-19, AMS will focus primarily on improving our school in the following areas: (1) Supportive Environment— focusing on new programming, enrichment and Arts programming; and (2) Rigorous Instruction—increasing the rigor  of writing assignments across all grades and subject areas, and working with teachers to align the writing curriculum  and rubrics across grade levels and subject areas.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X241   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   616   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        In the area of Rigorous Instruction, the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science has conducted a needs  assessment, and we have determined that our school has a variety of strengths and weaknesses. AMS continues to  have significant successes in the areas of:   (a) Consistency of Regents Exam Passing Rates--AMS has experienced consistent success across all grades and subject  areas in overall Regents examination pass rates. Although AMS has a widely differentiated student population, 28.5%  students with disabilities and 13% English Language Learners, the school continues to consistently achieve almost 90%  on-time graduation rates. Over 50% of the AMS students pass the Algebra Regents exam in 8th grade; 95% of the  students pass the ELA regents exam by the end of 11th grade; and the school continues to demonstrate consistent  success in standardized testing and credit accumulation.   (b) College Readiness—AMS has also experienced success in the area of college readiness, with a historical rate of  approximately 90% of its graduates enrolling in 2- or 4-year post-secondary institutions after high school. Although  AMS has only had 8 graduating cohorts of seniors, it is clear that students are succeeding in college. AMS was  featured in the DOE’s “School Time Lab” study as a model school that uses innovative programming strategies to  improve college and post-secondary success.   We also have identified an area of need:   Writing instruction and vertical alignment of our writing instruction across grade levels. Specifically, in 2017-18,  approximately 25% of AMS middle school students met standards on the NYS ELA exam (50 out of 259 scoring at  Levels 3 or 4). In addition, 16% of high school seniors in 2016-17 had scored 80 or higher on the NYS ELA Regents  examination. We have identified the need through data analysis and discussions with administrators, teachers,  students and parents. We are seeking to increase the level of engagement and rigor regarding writing by focusing and  aligning our writing rubrics and instruction and making sure they are progressively more rigorous across the grade  levels. We seek to increase the rigor of writing assignments, increase the number of students reaching proficiency  (levels 3 or 4) on the NYS middle school exams, and increase the number of students scoring above 80 on the ELA and  history Regents exams.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, we will refine our reading and writing data analysis and targeted instruction for all students, as evidenced  by an increase of 4% in the percentage of students scoring at Levels 3 and 4 both the middle school NYS ELA and Math  exams, from 25% to 29% in ELA and a 17% to 21% in math, and in students meeting college readiness benchmarks in  both ELA and Math Regents, from 16% to a 20%.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

All students  6-12   September  to June      To be more specific, approximately six of the Monday after  school professional development periods will be devoted to  writing-based professional development, infusing new writing  strategies into our work with general ed, special ed, and ELL  students. The Election Day professional development session will  also be devoted to training teachers in all subject areas on  reading and writing strategies (with a particular focus on using  texts in math and science classrooms, and using consistent  writing routines and rubrics across grade levels and subject  areas). Finally, the school's Team Leaders will provide support for  all teachers in their small-group collaborative planning meetings  (twice each week), and will report progress and needs in their  monthly meetings with the administration.      Research-based materials will be included in the curriculum  design work, including new units from Engage NY. Our previous  goal (from the past three years) was to focus specifically on  reading and engagement in higher-interest texts; this year, we  will continue to push for more comprehensive curriculum shifts  that increase the rigor of the writing assignments that assess the  reading and interpretation of text. Therefore, we expect higher  achievement results on the reading and writing portions of State  assessments will result.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15   Increase the programming of intensive reading interventions for  students with disabilities, English Language Learners, and other  struggling readers, as needed.

Specifically, we will host PTA meetings that align to the needs of  individual grade levels, including workshops to support parent  strategies to help students with homework, and also "Open  Library" Saturdays when parents can join their children at the  school library.   All students  Monthly PTA   meetings  and  workshops,  October to  May    Assistant Principal  Reginald Scott; PTA;  parents             3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  AMS uses a wide range of strategies to engage and support parents in their work supporting their children's  instruction. AMS parents are highly engaged, with over 90% attending parent teacher conferences three times each  year. At these conferences, the students' advisors provide detailed information and together (student, parent, and  advisor), the team designs goals for the students to accomplish during the next marking period. At those conferences,  teachers and advisors can provide advice in how to best support students' academic needs. Assistant Principal  Reginald Scott and Parent Coordinator Yelena Ramirez provide overall support and supervision of the parent  conferences, which take place in November, February and June.   In addition to our student, parent, and advisor conferences, both teachers and advisors will call home at least once a  week to communicate student progress. Through our advisory system, parents have access to one consistent adult in  the building (the advisor) who serves as the liaison between the school and the home.   Additional supports for parents occur during: Home Visits for all new students in August (supervised by Principal  Ingrid Chung, Teacher Anthony Madison, and Parent Coordinator Yelena Ramirez); Open House in September, where  all academic teams provide information for parents on curriculum and instruction, as well as information about after  school and enrichment opportunities; and College Nights, provided each year for 11th and 12th grade parents  (supervised by the college counselor Benjamin Ramos).           Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  We plan to shift our focus from reading to writing instruction, and we will measure the progress toward this goal by  analyzing middle school NYS ELA exam results and high school ELA and social studies Regents exams. We believe it is  achievable because we will focus our yearlong professional development on creating a culture of rigorous and  engaging writing instruction, use of consistent writing routines and rubrics across all grade levels and subject areas,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16      and to increase the time students spend writing and receiving feedback from teachers. This goal is relevant because it  aligns with a data-based area for improvement of the school, and will impact student achievement and engagement  across all subject areas. It is time-bound because we will monitor and assess progress toward this goal at key  benchmarks throughout the year, and we will expect to see the increases in assessment results (and decreases in the  number of students who are far below grade level) by the end of the school year in June 2019.   This goal will be met by using our school’s standard DOE budget for testing and professional development. We will  also use additional funding and supports from the Middle School Quality Initiative, and the NYS Extended Learning  Time grant program. AMS provides reduced teaching assignments for several teacher “team leaders,” including ELA  and Special Education teachers who will provide leadership in the areas in this initiative.    Specifically, Principal Chung and humanities team leaders Tyree Alexander, Virginia Ford, Angel Rivera, and T'keyah  Robinson will supervise this initiative and devote approximately 30% of their time to supervision and professional  development for staff in these areas. Teacher team leaders will have reduced teaching assignments of up to two  periods each per day in order to facilitate collaboration and support in this area. Approximately 20 per diem days of  substitute teacher assignments will be utilized to provide coverage for teachers to attend PD sessions on writing and  other related training. A portion of NYSTL funding will also be devoted to expansion of classroom libraries and leveled  reading texts, in order to support rigorous and engaging writing assignments. The Middle School Quality Initiative will  provide a monthly coaching visit from an ELA instructional expert.      Part 4b.

By February 2019, AMS will see, on average, a 2 point increase in the percentage of students reading at grade level.  The DRP reading assessments will be administered in September, December and May/June. We expect to see upward  movement in at least 75% of our students between the September 2018 and December 2018 administrations of that  assessment, with at least a 2 point overall school-wide increase in the number of students reading at their respective  "grade level" benchmarks according to the DRP.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The AMS School Leadership Team has conducted a needs assessment in the Framework for Great Schools element of  “Supportive Environment.” In that needs assessment, we have identified several areas of strength and success at  AMS:    a) Advisory: The AMS advisory program is a crucial support for every student in the school. Advisory provides an  opportunity for students to engage with each other (and with staff) in a supportive, non-academic setting. It provides  space for discussions, goal setting and self-improvement. It also provides a crucial link between the school staff and  parents.   b) Home Visits: The AMS system of home visits is another mechanism for creating a supportive environment. The new  AMS staff visit all new, incoming students during the August before their enrollment to meet, answer questions, and  to establish a relationship before the school year begins. The AMS leadership teams hopes that the home visit  tradition helps to create a supportive sense of “team-work” between the school and the families that we serve.   c) Summer Quest/Summer In The City: AMS was a member of the DOE’s Summer Quest initiative for four years, and  continued similar summer enrichment programming in summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 as a part of the Summer In  The City initiative. This program provides a rich, engaging, summer enrichment program for 100 of the AMS middle  school students (approximately 40%). It allows us to take students on hiking and camping trips outside of New York  City, and to engage in a variety of enrichment activities (focusing on STEM and the Arts) for five weeks every summer.  Summer In The City aims to reduce “summer learning loss,” (and therefore, it also supports the goal of “rigorous  instruction”), while also creating a more supportive environment for our students by giving them fun and exciting  opportunities during the summer.    The needs assessment also identified an area for potential growth:   AMS should create a more “supportive environment” by providing increased opportunities for after school and  Saturday programs through intentional summer programming, enrichment, remediation, homework help, trips, and  family workshops. By providing additional programs, AMS will fill a crucial need of its students and families—to  provide enrichment and different spaces for inclusivity, as well as a wider range of options in sports, the Arts and  reading.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18      By June of 2019, AMS will broaden the scope of its programming beyond the traditional school day and increase the  options in the Arts, sports, and additional time for reading, resulting in an increased sense of belonging among AMS  students, as evidenced by an increase of 7% of AMS students with over 90% attendance, from 29% to 22% with a  specific focus on the sub-group of young men of color.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   AMS will provide at least 5 additional hours of programming for  every student per week, throughout the school year, for all  grades from six to twelve. This goal is “Achievable” because AMS  has been granted funding through the New York State Extended  Learning Time grant program. We have already identified a  leadership and organizational team for this work, and we will  work together with the Middle School Quality Initiative to  implement the programming. This goal is “Relevant” because  extended learning time opportunities support the families of  AMS in countless ways. Students benefit from enrichment  programming; they learn to skills and develop talents;  attendance improves; and struggling students will have more  frequent opportunities for extra help. This goal is “Time-Bound”  because the objective will be met immediately—extended time  programming will begin in September, and the NYS grant will  continue for two years. After those two years, we will work on  new strategies and budgetary options for making the work  sustainable.      NYS Extended Learning Time grant program will provide 20%  additional hours of programming (above and beyond the normal  school day) during summer, weekends and after school. These  extended time programs will include Arts programming; small  group reading clubs; and sports and fitness.      At least one Team Leader will have a reduced teaching  assignment to serve as a co-coordinator of the ELT programming.  The ELT planning team will meet weekly with Principal to assess  data and plan programming.

DOE and CBO partners will provide  PD opportunities for all staff on social-emotional supports for all  children (DOE training session for all staff on Election Day, and a  CBO training for all advisors in January 2019). These two training  sessions will support staff in identifying social emotional needs  of students.   This goal will also be addressed through new parent involvement  strategies.

Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for  implementation and oversight.  AMS uses a wide range of strategies to engage and support parents in their work making the school a supportive  environment. AMS parents are highly engaged, with over 90% attending parent teacher conferences three times each  year. At these student-led conferences, the students' advisors provide detailed information, including goals for the  students to accomplish during the next marking period. At those conferences, teachers and advisors can provide  advice in how to best support students' academic needs. Assistant Principal Teri Russiello and Parent Coordinator  Yelena Ramirez provide overall support and supervision of the parent conferences, which take place in November,  February and June.   Student leaders share their ideas with Principal Ingrid Chung on a monthly basis in what we call "The Breakfast Club."  Nominated by their peers, two students per grade meet with respective members from other cohorts to discuss  school-wide concerns, design new clubs, and share ideas on how to make AMS a more supportive environment.  Student leaders of our young men's leadership program led by Principal Ingrid Chung, Assistant Principals Teri  Russiello and Reginald Scott, Teachers Chaka Baker, Tommy Gonzalez, and Bismark Oppong, and Community  Assistants Alain LaTortue, Julio Martinez, and Jose Medina, will also play a key role in mentoring younger students and  serving as models of excellence.   Additional supports for parents occur during: Home Visits for all new students in August (supervised by Principal  Ingrid Chung, Teacher Anthony Madison, PTA Vice-President Addinea Manigualt, and Parent Coordinator Ramirez);  Open House in September, where all academic teams provide information for parents on curriculum and instruction,  as well as information about after school and enrichment opportunities; and College Nights, provided each year for  11th and 12th grade parents (supervised by the college counselors Ramos and Rojas).

AMS is participating in four programs  that all provide staffing, resources and funds—the NYS Extended Learning Time grant; the NYC DOE Middle School  Quality Initiative; and the DOE/DYCD middle school after school grant program.    All of these programs will provide support and funding to allow for substantial increases in programming outside of  school hours. Although there will be no official extension of the school day or shift in start/end times, AMS will  partner with CBOs (Wingspan Arts and New York Junior Tennis and Learning), and will provide teacher overtime, in  order to provide a wide range of Saturday and after school programs.   Specifically, AMS will run the following programs (in addition to others TBD):   a) Saturday programs that will operate in four, six-week cycles over the course of the year, with various inter-grade  course options in reading/book clubs, sports and the Arts;   b) a five-week summer camp program for middle school students, Monday to Friday from 8:30 to 3:30;   c) two, week-long summer intensive intervention programs for struggling and at-risk high school students for young  men & women of color;   d) after school enrichment opportunities for all grades from Monday to Friday.   A team of leaders supervising the Extended Learning Time program will include Principal and Assistant Principals.  During the 2018-19 school year, AMS will devote substantial funds from the NYS ELT grant for per session (for  teachers working after school, Saturdays and summer) and per diem work for substitute teachers and non- pedagogues for similar programming.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   One of the most significant areas of strength of the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science is in the  area of teacher collaboration. In conducting our Needs Assessment, we confirmed that teachers work together in  collaborative teams on virtually all of the work that they do, on a daily basis. Virtually all of our core academic  teachers work jointly with other teachers to plan daily lessons, to align their curriculum across grade levels and  disciplines, and to create grading and feedback consistency across various classrooms. These collaborative teaching  teams are led by a dedicated group of teacher team leaders that is composed of assistant principals and talented  veteran teachers who are instructional leaders in their relative content areas.   Data that supports this assessment is found in the 2015-16 Quality Review report, which found the indicator "Teacher  Teams and Leadership Development" to be the school's "Area of Celebration." The reviewer noted that, "All teachers  are engaged in collaborative inquiry based teacher teams. Distributive leadership structures afford teacher teams the  opportunity to make key decisions about teaching and learning through the analysis of student work products leading  to the revision of curriculum."    Additionally, we have a team of eleven team leaders, five of which are administrators and six of which were teachers.  Within this group, two of our assistant principals were within their first or second year and four of our teacher team  leaders were brand new. Towards the latter half of our school year, our principal began the process of transitioning  out of our school and one of our teacher team leaders made a career change, leaving our team leader team with only  nine members, most of which were new and inexperienced. We will begin next year with two of our more veteran  teacher team leaders on maternity leave until December.   AMS has a few areas where teacher collaboration could be improved and expanded. Teacher team leaders continue  to express (during team leader meetings) a need for additional coaching to support the academic teachers and  advisors on their teams. Teacher team leaders and administrators agree that additional time should be devoted to  developing and preparing our newest team leaders, assistant principals, and emerging leaders so that they can be  strong mentors, rigorous instructional leads, and inspiring role models for other teachers at our school so that we can  have exemplary instruction in every single classroom for all of our young people.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

The Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science has a strong and cohesive leadership team, consisting of a  large group of administrators and teachers who have worked together at AMS for many years. This team includes  instructional leaders in all subject areas, all of whom have worked on collaborative planning teams at AMS for several  years before they transitioned into leadership roles.   The report from the 2015-16 Quality Review clearly demonstrates that leadership development is a school strength,  stating that "The work, frequency of meetings, and variation of teacher teams, provide all teachers with opportunities  to engage in shared leadership and professional collaborations, resulting in improved teacher capacity and student  outcomes across the school community . . . Distributed leadership is embedded into the teacher teams." With that  said, we would like to increase the amount of distributed leadership on all administrative levels, developing new and  emerging leaders, including, but not limited to, opportunities for teachers to get involved with programming, testing,  advisory leadership, discipline, and instructional leadership.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   One of the most important strengths of the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science is the school's deep  and valuable relationships among the staff and the families. The AMS School Leadership Team is devoted to  continuing and strengthening these staff-family relationships, and to continue to improve our children's education as  a result.   AMS has many measurable and demonstrated successes in this area: Over 90% of our families attend each of the  three parent teacher conference sessions per year ("Student Parent Advisor conferences"); the staff of AMS conducts  "Home Visits" for all new, incoming sixth grade students and ninth grade students; and our PTA and SLT are actively  involved in the school's leadership decisions and enrichment programming.   As a part of this Needs Assessment, we noticed on the NYC School Survey that our data increased from 3.10 in 2017 to  3.83 in 2018. And while this is a substantial increase, we would like that numerical to increase to around 4.00.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, we will deepen our home-school partnership, as evidenced by a 5% increase in family participation in  educational planning meetings and conferences (including PTA meetings, parent-advisor conferences and IEP  conferences), from 85% to 90%. We will increase opportunities for parent engagement by 50%, including, but not  limited to, Family Game Night, Family Circles, and Literacy-based PDs for parents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science uses a variety of strategies to maintain the highest possible  standards of qualifications for its teachers.       For teacher recruitment, AMS organizes a team of teacher team leaders, administrators, and students to participate in  the recruitment process. We seek diverse candidates from programs like the NYC Teaching Fellows program, Teach  for America, NYCMenTeach, and through the Open Market Transfer system. We also attend open houses at various  local graduate schools of education. We actively seek candidates who have substantial undergraduate and graduate  level coursework in their areas of instruction.      For retention, AMS conducts regular meetings with all teachers (at the beginning and end of the school year) to  discuss “career path” options and to provide mentoring and support for teachers hoping to pursue a career in  teaching (or in school leadership). AMS actively encourages its teachers to continue with further graduate coursework  and to earn additional degrees that lead to “highly qualified” status.      AMS also has a school-wide system of professional development that is tailored to the individual needs of each  teacher. We focus our P.D. on a system of grade/subject level team meetings --- with veteran teachers and  administrators acting as “team leaders” for twice-weekly meetings and P.D. sessions for every core academic teacher  in the school.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      The strategies for professional development and support of high quality teachers is focused at AMS on the system of  collaborative team planning. All teachers work together in subject area/grade level teams, supported by a Team  Leader (who is an administrator or veteran teacher with a demonstrated record of strong achievement results. These  teams meet at least twice-weekly to plan their upcoming lessons and to support the development of a curriculum that  is strongly grounded in the Common Core goals. These teams include Special Education teachers, general education  teachers and administrators. These meetings are individually tailored to meet the needs of individual teachers, and to  support the areas of the Danielson Framework for Teaching that best supports that individual team.   In addition, AMS completed an SBO vote to include an opportunity for grade-level advisory teams to meet for  professional development as a group every Monday, from 3:05-4:15 p.m. At these “Grade Level Advisory Team”  meetings, staff discusses the progress of individual students (and focusing heavily on the support of at-risk students),  and the team leaders provide professional development on additional strategies that the teams can implement to  support struggling students. These meetings take on an even greater importance, in light of the additional rigor set for  in the Common Core Standards.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     School administrators provide professional development for all staff during the first two days of September; on  Election Day; on parent teacher conference days (pending DOE approval of schedule change); and in June. On all of  these days, teachers, team leaders and administrators discuss the various assessment measures that are administered   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      at each grade/subject level, and the school leadership solicits input from the teachers regarding these assessments. In  August and September 2018, the school’s MOSL committee will meet to provide recommendations to the principal  regarding the MOSL decisions, as a part of the NYC DOE Advance system for teacher evaluation.    The administration will continue to seek feedback and suggestions from teachers throughout the year regarding the  value and effectiveness of all assessments in order to make decisions about assessments and curriculum needs that  will benefit the students in future years.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X241, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science (09X241) will support parents and families of Title I  students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   09X241, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

We offer after-school  reading and writing programs designed to help students gain a greater understanding of grade- appropriate reading which include guided reading groups. These groups help students gain a  greater understanding of the academic language they will be facing in their core academic  classes.  Our after-school programming for ESL students will be integrated into our general education  after school programming.  Programs are offered to all students in grades 6-12, and we will seek  to include 50% of our total ESL population in the programming (depending on their availability  and willingness to stay after school).  The program identifies ELL students and ELL students  with IEP's who are struggling in any core academic class, and encourages them to participate  (and fills remaining seats with other ESL students). The primary goal of the program will be to  provide students with support on assignments from their academic classes.  The licensed  ESL teachers will provide targeted ESL strategies to support the work being completed. After  school programming occurs school-wide, across all grade levels, from October through May,  five days a week. Monday is arts/enrichment only (no ESL or academics for staff PD meetings);  Tuesday to Thursday, 3:30 PM - 5:30 PM, and Fridays 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM. The coursework and  materials vary throughout the school year: in the fall, we focus on reading support and support  for in-school assignments; in the spring, the work shifts to targeted test-prep based on the needs  of individual students. Programming is done in groups of 15 or fewer.  Additional support for our school's ELL students will occur during our Saturday Academy.  This  program happens on two Saturdays per month in the fall, and three Saturdays per month in the  spring, from 9:30 PM - 2:00 PM.  ESL students who attend Saturday Academy will receive  similar academic supports as they receive in our after-school program. In the fall, the focus is on  providing ESL and language supports for in-class assignments and readings. In the spring, focus  will shift to preparing students for State assessments, depending on the strengths and weaknesses  of individual students. Work will be done in groups of 15 or fewer. Instruction runs from 9:30  PM - 12:30 PM, followed by a break for lunch and physical activity (sports or fitness).    The language used in instruction will be English.  However, translation dictionaries are available  to students as needed to help foster student independence to look up new words encountered in  the readings, improve vocabulary and grammar in essay writing, and use the correct parts of  speech in English.  Our after-school and Saturday academy support will be provided by our ELL team, consisting of  Mr. Romain, Ms. Carsky, Ms. Urena,  and Ms. McGrath.  These teachers are all ELL licensed,  and some have additional content area licenses.  We will be allocating approximately 30 hours of  per session for this work which will begin in October and end in April.  We will likely use our  additional funding from our Extended Learning Time (ELT) grant.  The materials required for these programs consist of laptop and desktop computers; LCD  projectors; iPads; Digital, hardcover, and paperback books; and Dictionaries and Thesauri.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Specific instructional programs will be linked to the content and curriculum taught in the  students' main academic courses.  Attendance sign-in sheets will be maintained for all after school and Saturday programming.  Some additional funding is provided for our after school and Saturday programs this year  through the NYS Extended Learning Time grant and the DYCD middle school SONYC  program. All records for attendance will be maintained through those program coordinators and  will be available in their offices at all times.

At our school,  Professional Development is generally merged into collaborative planning work of small,  grade/subject specific teams who meet twice a week. (The times and dates of these meetings vary  by team, based on the teaching schedules of each teacher.) All of our ELL teachers are included  on one of the main academic co-planning teams, and much of their PD occurs on these teams.  The professional development occurs in two directions: (1) the school's instructional "Team  Leaders" provide PD for the ESL teachers, during these twice weekly team meetings, where ESL  strategies are discussed in the context of the daily planning. And (2) the ESL teachers provide  PD for non-ESL teachers in how to incorporate ESL strategies into general education lessons and  instruction. Much of this PD occurs in the same common planning teams. This common planning  ensures that ELL supports are truly offered in context, and not unrelated to students' specific  academic needs.  Additional, in-house professional development will happen in a number of ways.  1) ELL teachers will be provided coverage for their classes, allowing them to attend an off-site  PD session provided by the DOE. (The principal will work with them to select an appropriate  session or arrange an inter-visit to a school that has demonstrated high levels of success at ELL  instruction.) The dates and times of these PDs have not yet been determined, and will be  discussed with the ELL teachers depending on their individual needs and goals this year.  2) Throughout the year, our ELL teachers will join the Team Meetings for teams they are not on  to provide training on strategies for supporting ELL students in all of their classes.  3) Our school will dedicate two of our Monday whole-staff PD sessions to provide school-wide  support for English Language Learners.  This support will be aligned with out school-wide  writing initiative.  Our ELL team will lead this PD to provide strategies for non-ELL teachers to  help them achieve our school-wide writing goals. These Monday PD sessions will occur on  February 4, 2019 and March 11, 2019. The sessions will include all teachers, from 3:10 PM -  4:20 PM.  Attendance records are maintained by the principal on sign-in sheets (in a file in his office or  digitally for the full staff sessions; and attendance records are maintained for daily team meetings  by the Team Leaders (teachers always must attend, barring absence from school). Agendas are  maintained by the principal (in a file in his office for full staff sessions) and by Team Leaders for  daily planning sessions.  The PD programs will be at no cost to the program (part of normal teacher salaries or external  PD provided by the DOE Borough Support team.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49        Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Parents of ELL students will attend three mandated conferences per year, November,  February and June. During these one-on-one conferences, parents will have meetings with their  child's advisor about his/her progress during the marking period.  ELL Coordinator Mr. Romain  and ELL Teachers will coordinate with advisors and meet with parents to discuss the next steps  students can take in order to increase their understanding of their newly acquired second  language by focusing on reading strategies and skills students will be exposed to at school and  should practice at home.  These conferences coincide with the parent conferences for all students  in the school, and will be supplemented by ELL information, and status updates regarding the  students' ELL supports and needs.  The ELL team will provide additional feedback and suggestions to parents for ways to increase  the success of the ELL student.  In addition, we will ensure translation services are provided at  all of those meetings to assist with communicating effectively with the parents. We will also  show parents how to use free on-line services that will help their child in reading, math and  history.   Mr. Romain, will work with the Parent Coordinator, Ms. Ramirez, to plan and facilitate three  workshops for parents of ELL's, that will provide parents with additional information to support  their children.  Topics will include:  On-Line Resources to Support the ELL Child (to help their  child with reading, math, history), Education Outside the Classroom for ELL's, Creating Home  Conditions to Support Learning for ELL's, Family Literacy in Both Languages, Social and  Emotional Development for ELL's and College Information and Application Support for ELL's.    Although some parent workshops are still in the planning stages, several specific programs have  already been scheduled:    1) Open House: for all parents, with ESL information available (along with any other Q&A for  parents), September 2018    2) College Night: for parents of 12th graders, one session for English speakers, and a separate  room for Spanish speakers, providing a detailed overview of the college application process.  Program provided by AMS and its college counseling office (supported by the College Bound  Initiative)    3) PTA Fall Brunch (Saturday, November 17 , 2018)    4) College Night: spring event for parents of 11th graders (date TBD)    Approximately half of the students at AMS speak Spanish at home. Therefore, all written parent  communications (letters home, flyers, emails) are provided in English and Spanish. A Spanish- speaker is always available in the Main Office to translate for visitors and those who call on the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    phone. Approximately 1/3 of the AMS teachers speak Spanish fluently, and all others may ask  for translation assistance any time they call parents. The DOE provides translation service for  parents who speak languages other than Spanish, as well.    Attendance, sign in sheets and agendas for parent sessions are all maintained by the principal (in  coordination with the Parent Coordinator and main office support staff).

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to assess the literacy skills of our ELL students, we use the DRP reading assessment three times per year. We  administer the DRP assessment in September, December and May for all students in the school, and it allows us to quickly  assess reading levels and growth over the course of the year. For our middle school students, we also use NYSESLAT and NYS  ELA assessment results. For our low level readers, we also use more detailed assessments, such as Fountas and Pinnell or other  individual reading assessments.  The results of our reading assessments demonstrate that our ELL students are often (but not  always) among our lower-level readers. Specifically, it seems that the ELL students who have been long-term ELLs (who arrived  in our school after several years of ELL service in their elementary schools) are very often students with Special Needs, as well.  As a result of this data, we try to shift our instructional supports to match their needs. Specifically, our lowest level ELL  students will often be placed in reading intervention programs in 6  th   or 9  th   grade, when they arrive in our school, in an  effort to improve their reading levels more quickly.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have a comprehensive, school-wide system of common planning meetings for every grade/subject team. All teams share  daily lesson planning responsibilities and analyze data in teams. Given this structure, our school can support the ENL students  because a licensed ENL teacher is a member of most grade teams. If a team does not have an ENL teacher on the team, the  ENL teacher can join the meetings to provide support and input into the planning and data analysis process in order to  guarantee that the needs of ENL students are incorporated.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate success of our ELL program by looking at their reading fluency as well as their test scores in all of their main  academic courses throught the course of the year. We also look at student scores on state tests such as the Regents in order to  determine our ELL students' progress in gaining cognitive academic language proficiency in their second language. We also  strive to focus on long-term intellectual and social-emotional development of our students. As a school serving students from  grades six through twelve, this long-terms focus is our school's goal for all students--and it is especially important for Students  with Disabilities and English Language Learners. By focusing on long-term development, we expect to see small, consistent  data-based progress for all students every year--and, as a result, our goal is for the on-time graduation rate of our ELL students  (at the end of twelfth grade) to be equal to our on-time graduation rate for non-ELL students.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Again, our school has team meetings to share and analyze data and curriculum information at all grade levels on a daily basis.  In addition, staff PD and grade-level meetings occurs on Mondays after school--this provides another structure where student  information is reviewed and interventions are planned to address needs. These teams provide direct feedback to the school  administration and programming team to ensure that appropriate interventions are available for all students who need them.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   During the Monday PD sessions, the school has regular meetings of ENL teachers; SpEd teachers; and the SIT team. These  teams review data, identify at risk students (in any category) and plan interventions appropriate to the needs of students. The  SIT team, SpEd leadership team, counseling team and ENL team all communicate to make sure the RTI and AIS frameworks  include attention to ENL supports when needed.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the NYSESLAT grades we have received, many of our ELL students struggle with writing informative/explanatory  texts to examine and convey complex ideas, concepts, and information clearly and accurately through an effective  selection.  Due to this fact, our literature courses have been structured to include many more critical reading passages that  expand in length and difficulty as the year progresses in addition to analytical questions and longer writing assignments.  This  enables them to get a deeper and more analytical understanding of the literature's main idea, plot, setting and character  development in the text.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Based on the data identified, the school organizes routine meetings of "Team Leaders" to address school-wide instructional  shifts, as well as interventions and shifts needed for ENL students. Assistant Principal Russiello supervises the SpEd, ESL and  RTI/counseling teams and attends all meetings of those teams--when adjustments to programs are needed, she communicates  directly with Principal Krulwich, who supervises the programming team, to ensure that proper programs are available to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         address all needs.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Middle school ESL students will attend a self-contained ESL class (separate from core academic classes), where they  will focus on building language through literacy. Additionally, an ESL teacher will provide push-in support during main  academic classes for our beginner and intermediate students, and those who are receiving SETSS services during the  ESL Literature period. This year, we also expanded our ESL teacher team, and are providing some additional push-in  ESL support during math classes. (We are piloting this support in 7  th   grade math classrooms.) Our middle school  ESL groups are mostly heterogeneously grouped, except for some groups that will receive targeted reading  interventions. Students who will benefit from the Wilson reading program will be grouped together. In high school,  our ESL support is provided through push in support in core academic classes--mostly in ELA and history classes,  where ESL students traditionally need the most support. Students are grouped heterogenously.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.           c.  DL program.  If applicable.               2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Students are grouped in blocked classes heterogeneosly.  Individualized literacy instruction is based on data from  previous exams and current in-class assessments, and is focused on the child’s most difficult modality of literacy: reading,  writing, listening, or speaking.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The majority of our ELL instruction occurs in core academic subject-area classrooms. Our ELL teachers are included on  common planning teams, where they help infuse ELL strategies into the daily lesson plans delivered to all students. These  common planning teams, which meet regurlary (bi-weekly) to plan all core academic curriculum, are aligned to the Common  Core Standards. The ELL teachers also push-in to join these common planning meetings throughout the year to provide ELL- based PD to all teachers.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      When needed, we provide staff who are fluent in Spanish or Translation Services using the DOE Helpline. We have a small  number of students (approximately 4 students in 2016-17, and the number in 2017-18 is TBD) whose English is so limited that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      they benefit from translation and extra support. In virtually all of these cases, AMS has been able to provide at least one core  academic teacher who is fluent in Spanish who can assist. Teachers can seek assistance from these staff members to help  arrange assessments in the student's native language. Our school arranges NYS and Regents testing in native languages when  permitted and available.    The majority of our ESL population, as well as at least one teacher at every grade level, speak English and Spanish. In addition  to our certified ESL teachers, the school employs two certified foreign language teachers who teach Spanish, all whose  certifications are on file.  When necessary, use of the Spanish language to those Spanish speakers is dependent on the  individual language needs of the Spanish-speaking student, and native language glossaries are available to students in each  subject area. Those ESL students with Special Education needs will also receive regular assistance from our Special Education  Coordinator, Mr. Broad, as well as the special requirements set aside for each individual student based on their IEPs.  ESL staff  members will continue to oversee students transitioning out of the ESL program for one year in order to provide any needed  support.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status        a.  In order to ensure that our 3 SIFE students get the small group individualized attention that they need, Rahsaan Romain  will have them in a small group for a more individualized literature in order to ensure SIFE students more regular individualized  attention.b.  Middle school students who have been in the US for 1-3 years are given smaller literature classes, with 6-8  students, at the end of the day with one of our certified ESL teachers. High school students will typically have an extra reading  intervention class that meets on alternating days for one period.c.  ELL students who have been receiving services for 4-6 years  receive push-in services in their main academic classes 3 times a week by one of the certified ESL teachers in order to help  them master their new language, and aid them from moving from BICS to CALP by reviewing new academic vocabulary in their  newly adopted second language.d.  Long-term ELLs are also given push-in services in their main academic classrooms by their  certified ESL teachers 3 times per week in order to help them attain mastery in their second language.e. Teachers of ESL  students use the SIOP model of instruction in their classrooms in order to help ELLs with solving and completing long-term  goals. They are given written and internet materials by ESL teachers and administrators in order to help them effectively  accelerate the language development of ELLs     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our school uses a rotating schedule that allows ELLs to have a variety of different classroom experiences in the course of a  week.  By having both small group instruction as well as whole class instruction (with push in) students are able to gain  experience functioning in varied environments.   Additionally we have health paraprofessionals in order to help some of our  ELLs with physical disabilities.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As described above, all of our school's instructional decision-making and curriculum design is done in small-group collaborative  teams that meet at least two times every week. All curriculum teams share lessons among all classes at the same grade level.  These teams are deliberately designed to include input from both SpEd and ELL licensed teachers. The schedule, therefore,  requires input from both SpEd and ELL instructional leaders, and it provides support for all ELL students, including those with  disabilities, within the least restrictive environment.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For all subgroups, our targeted interventions include strategies designed in the collaborative team planning meetings  described above.  These include differentiated readings, deliberate groupings, providing students with background knowledge  prior to lesson delivery, and designing curriculula that values ELL's home cultures and languages.  As noted above, lessons are  also designed to provide students with opportunities to acquire knowledge and demonstrate understanding in all four  modalities.  Whenever possible, entering and emerging learners are programmed in classes with teachers who speak their  home language (most often Spanish), even if that teacher is not ELL licenced.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year, we are expanding our small group interventions for ELL students.  We recently trained a group of teachers in the  "Wilson" and "Just Words" programs, and will be infusing these interventions into small group instructional groups when  appropriate.  These small groups meet every three days in middle school and every two days in high school.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have never offered a bilingual program.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. In fact, we have deliberately and carefully planned all of our ELL  supports so that they do not interrupt any other programs. All of the push-in support allows students to participate equally  without missing any time in core academic classes; and all of our small-group ELL support programs happen during  Independent Reading time for other students. ELL students have equal access to all electives, all academic programs, and all  after school opportunities.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructionally, ESL students are allotted access to our school rolling laptop carts in order to allow students to play interactive  language learning games and access content in other languages.  In addition to this, each class that ELL students attend is  equipped with video projectors. This allows all classroom teachers to implement ESL instructional strategies by providing visual  support for new vocabulary.  All ELL students are encouraged to attend after-school enrichment programs, homework help  and Saturday programs for additional support.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As noted above, many ELL students are enrolled in core academic classes with teachers (or at least one teacher) who speak  their home language (usually Spanish).  In addition, Spanish speaking ELLs in grades 8 through 11 are enrolled in a Spanish  Language course for native speakers, in which they read and analyze Spanish literature.  These lessons have similar design, and  similar student outcomes to those of our ELA classes.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    As noted above, our school has common planning teams for all core academic subject areas in all grades.  Lessons are planned  in collaboration with ELL teachers, who ensure that services are grade-level and age appropriate. Our administration does  periodic curriculum audits to ensure that the needs of all ELL students are being met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         When students receive pull-out ELL service, they are grouped by grade-level to ensure that interventions are age-appropriate.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share instructional resources in significant ways in our building. However, we do have a building library which is  shared, and we work to guarantee that all students have access to the space, the books and the computers as  needed. Instructionally within AMS, ESL students are allotted access to our school rolling laptop carts in order to allow  students to play interactive language learning games and access translation services, or to access content in their native  language.  In addition to this, each class that ELL students attend is equipped with video projectors. This allows all classroom  teachers to implement ESL instructional strategies by providing visual support for new vocabulary.  All ELL students are  encouraged to attend after-school enrichment programs, homework help and Saturday programs for additional support.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the school year begins, our parent coordinator schedules "Home Visits" for all ELLs students.  The Home Visits team  includes teachers who speak Spanish.  Parents have an opportunity to share specific needs of their students, and ask questions  about the services we provide.  Newly arriving ELLs also meet with our ELL team to discuss the services received in previous  schools, which were successful, and which were not.  Services for the upcoming year are planned based in information  gathered in these meetings along with analysis of student achievement data from previous years.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We offer a sequence of Spanish for Native Speakers courses, in addition to our traditional Spanish courses offered to non- Spanish speakers.  We occasionally offer a course in Latin or French, depending on staff availability.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N.A.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ELL department & leadership team consists of Principal Krulwich, Assistant Principal Russiello, and teachers McGrath,  Price, Carsky, Urena, Suppo, Rivera and Romain. These teachers range widely in experience level, and we are committed to  providing the needed training and support. Our goal is to provide substantial PD and support during bi-weekly subject area  planning meetings for all teachers; additional monthly ELL team meetings, with rotating topics for professional development;  and we will work together with the ELL teachers to choose targeted PD opportunities (provided by the DOE Central or BSC) in  areas that would benefit them the most.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         In addition, approximately three of our weekly Monday staff PD meetings will be devoted to ELL professional development  that our ELL teachers will provide for all other teachers in our school.      Finally, for all teachers, at least one of the Advance observations will focus on the supports the teacher is providing for Special  Ed and ELL students within the general ed classrooms.     The full PD plan is described in question 1, above. Our PD sessions in the bi-weekly curriculum planning meetings is designed to  target student work in the Common Core Learning Standards. These meetings occur twice each week for all teachers, and ELL  teachers will join and support those meetings to provide targeted support for ELLs.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As a 6-12 school, we focus heavily on supporting all of our students in transitioning from middle school to high school. We  focus heavily in our Advisory program at the end of 8  th   grade on preparing all students for high school. We have  individualized meetings with every parent in June in order to discuss the students' strengths and weaknesses, and to plan any  extra supports needed for high school. We also provide PD for all teachers (ELL teachers, Gen Ed teachers, and all advisors) on  identifying and supporting students of various sub-groups (SpEd, ELL, etc.) as they complete their first marking period in 9   th   grade.     School wide documentation contains the schedules for all common planning meetings in every small-group instructional  planning team throughout the school. In addition, all Monday school-wide PD meetings are documented, with agendas that  are circulated via email on a weekly basis. Assistant Principal Ingrid Chung coordinates the Monday PD sessions and maintains  records of those hours. Monthly ELL team meetings are scheduled and agendas are maintained.     More specifically, one PD session in September is devoted to training all teachers to understand the needs and  accommodations of all sub-groups, including IEP and ESL accommodations. Two PD sessions are provide during the spring for  all teachers--training them formally on specific ESL accommodations that they can provide within their daily lesson plans. In  addition, staff engage in PD in their twice-weekly grade/team meetings that focus on collaborative planning and data analysis.  In these meetings, AMS plans to have a licensed ESL teacher on all grade level teams, allowing them to infuse ESL support into  all collaborative planning meetings. If a team does not have an ESL teacher on the team, an ESL teacher will join the meetings  once a month to provide that support.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   This year, we will implement a procedure whereby the ELL service providers will call the parents of all ELL students twice per  year -- once at the beginning of the year to discuss their service and goals; and again in June to discuss assessment results and  progress over the course of the school year. Parents will be invited to individual meetings for further discussion and support,  or the discussions will happen on the telephone (at the parents' discretion).    In addition, AMS provides a huge amount of structured outreach to all parents, and we provide support for ESL students within  those structures. For example, all new students are visited at home in August by a team of 2 or 3 teachers (including a Spanish  speaking staff member) for a welcoming "Home Visit." At this meeting, we will discuss any specific needs or supports for the  child and answer any questions for parents. This will allow us to assess the home language and begin an open line of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59            communication with all families.    Finally, all parents attend 3 annual parent conferences, with individually scheduled appointments with their child's advisor. If  these meetings raise any questions or issues regarding the ESL supports for the child, an ESL teacher or administrator will join  the meeting to discuss and answer any questions about the student's goals.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our school greatly values parent involvement. We have three parent-teacher conference sessions every year, with individually- scheduled appointments for every parent and child to meet with their advisor. These conferences consistently achieve 90%  parent participation. We also have a variety of parent workshops--many of which are designed to benefit parents of ELL  students (as well as all others). We have parent workshops for (1) college application support; (2) College information  and FAFSA workshops; (3) "How to Speak with your kids about…." workshops about issues for teens; (4) PTA and SLT meetings;  September/October Open House. All of these meetings and workshops are translated and accessible for non-English speaking  parents.        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.                              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Krulwich, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   UA Sch Applied Math & Science                                                                              School DBN: 09X241  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      All documents given to students are produced in both English and Spanish (whenever possible). Families with  other language needs are translated by appropriate staff members or the Language Line (over the phone  interpretation service) provided by New York City Department of Education. Emergency contact cards are given  out and collected the first week of school and parents are contacted by their child's advisor to make sure that the  telephone numbers are valid. Attendance Coordinator and Parent Coordinator Yelena Ramirez supervises the  Main Office staff and confirms that all students who are new to the NYC DOE are provided with the Home  Language Identification Survey. These responses are then noted in ATS. Our school also conducts "Home Visits"  for all new students during August before their enrollment--staff members visit the homes of the students. During  these home visits, staff visit the homes in teams (all teams have a Spanish speaker) and make sure the family  receives information that they need. If necessary, translations are available through the DOE's translation unit.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, we try to call home in the presence of the student to allow the student to translate for  the parent by phone. If the student is not available to translate, we typically attempt to find a staff member who  speaks the family's language, or would use the DOE's translation service.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Staff members will receive this information at an all staff meeting in September. Resources available include many  staff members who speak Spanish and will translate on the phone or in a face-to-face meeting. The Department of  Education translation services are also available, if needed.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

We will also have multilingual posters up that welcome incoming parents.  Parents will be given the Parent Bill of Rights (available in multiple languages) during the Open House in September.  The Language ID guide will be made available available for security guards at the security desk for all formal and  informal parent meetings.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school will administer a parent survey in order to get feedback from parents on the quality of communication  between the school and families--and we will specifically seek information regarding the adequacy of translation and  interpretation for families who speak languages other than English.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Also, advisors communicate with parents frequently and will determine if parents need translation support and inform  the Language Access Coordinator.
