The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission: With a strong focus on environmental stewardship, sustainability and wellness, the Brooklyn Environmental  Exploration School (BEES) fosters high academic achievement, independent thinking, problem solving and civic  engagement. Through a dynamic interdisciplinary curriculum all students become active, creative and enthusiastic  learners who see the value of knowledge and apply their school experiences to affect real world change. Continual  assessment and evaluation inform the educational program. BEES prepares students for success in high school,  college and beyond by instilling the urgency of protecting and nurturing our natural world, our communities and  ourselves.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School (BEES) was founded in September of 2013 and reached full capacity in  school year 2015 – 2016 serving grades 6 through 8.       We believe in the ability of all students to achieve high academic success. Based on this belief, our school is one in  which all community members are accountable for students making the strides necessary to be college and career  ready. Through lessons that feature high levels of student ownership, personalized instruction, frequent checks of  student understanding, and high levels of engagement, our school can ensure that when students leave our school  they are prepared for success in high school, in college, and beyond. We are a small learning community that  recognizes the inherent struggles that face middle school students each day and yet we will not offer excuses for not  reaching the highest achievement levels.       We use several partnerships to support students’ social-emotional, academic, and character growth which include:    ● SONYC After school Program: In partnership with New York Edge / SASF our 6 th -8 th grade classes are enrolled and  participating in comprehensive after school programming. Students participate in athletics, arts, academic support  and academic enrichment from 2:40 to 5:40 Monday-Friday with additional camp days during school vacation days  and over the summer.           ● ArtsConnection: In partnership with ArtsConnection BEES students receive arts instruction in six different  specialities over the course of the school year. BEES students participate in three cycles with two different  arts disciplines per cycle. The residencies correlate to the Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in: Visual Arts,  Dance, Music, Theater, Play writing, Theater Production.   ● Urban Advantage: Urban Advantage is a standards-based partnership program designed to improve students'  understanding of scientific inquiry through collaborations between urban public school systems and science cultural  institutions. BEES science and special education teachers receive monthly weekend professional development on the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11      UA model. In addition BEES students participate in workshops at UA cultural institutions across NYC to enhance their  understanding of scientific inquiry.   ● Ramapo For Children: In partnership with Ramapo for Children, BEES classes participate in a team building overnight  retreat to the Ramapo Camp in Rhinebeck, NY each fall. In addition, BEES teachers have all been trained in the  Ramapo model “Teachers as Leaders”. A Ramapo coach visits, observes and coaches new BEES staff each fall  semester.      ● Learning Partner school for fall 2018-2019 which partners us with one Liberty Ave Middle School (LAMS)   and School of the Future Brooklyn (SOFBK) to share best practices and collaborate in the spirit of mutual  benefit. Our teachers will serve as model teachers both for our own staff and for staff from our partner  schools to visit.            ● Middle School Quality Initiative: (MSQI) Another important initiative for the 2018-2019 school year is continued  participation in MSQI. This citywide initiative is to support literacy across the entire school. With guidance and  support from the MSQI coaches and partner schools, we will be able to establish and implement school wide literacy  initiatives that are research based and tailored especially for middle school students.      In September 2016, BEES was awarded a School Improvement Grant (SIG Cohort 7) from the New York State  Education Department. In 2018-2019 the SIG will support the following partnerships:           Teachers College Center for the Professional Education of Teachers (CPET) - CPET is the lead partner for the   SIG grant. CPET's initial work with BEES will be centered at the instructional core. Developing a curriculum  plan that is relevant, authentic, and comprehensive is as challenging as it is important. Curriculum maps will  set both aspirational and realistic goals for teachers and students. PD coaches support content area teachers  to design, adjust or adapt curriculum customized to their school community.     Achievement Network (ANET) - ANET Four times a year, ANET provides interim assessments that give   educators timely, actionable, and student-specific data. We meticulously develop assessment questions that  align to the standards and reflect the demands of state summative assessments. This helps teachers  understand what students know and can do. But the data from our assessments don’t capture only right and  wrong they provide information about which students are struggling, with what, and why.     Creative Connections - Creative Connections will provide College and Career discovery courses for 6, 7, 8th   grade students at BEES. In addition, Creative Connections will serve as lead partner in our College Access for  All program, arranging college tours for BEES students. In 2018 BEES students visited Barnard College,  Princeton University and Queens College with Creative Connections.    3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school population comprises 85% Black and 15% Hispanic students. The student body includes 4% English  language learners and 21% students with disabilities. Boys account for 53% of the students enrolled and girls account  for 47%. The average attendance rate for the school year to date is 90.6%. Specific needs include academic gaps, and  social-emotional support.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As a school, BEES has made the most progress in the "Rigorous Instruction" section of the Framework for Great  Schools. The school had a 19% increase in proficiency scores from 2016-2017 on the NY State ELA Exam. The school  had a 9% increase in proficiency scores from 2016-2017 on the NY State Math Exam. Our focus for the 2018-2019  school year will be on Collaborative Teachers. We are devoting significant resources to continue raising student  achievement in ELA and Math through partnerships with Teachers College Center for the Professional Education of  Teachers and Achievement Network as we establish our Curriculum. We will provide teachers the opportunity to  participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.               2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 23K664   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   95   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   X               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   During the 2016-2017 school year BEES was visited by SED Integrated Intervention Team (IIT). The purpose of this review  is to provide the school with feedback regarding the practices across the school and to provide a number of actionable  recommendations to direct the school’s work in the immediate future.    Recommendation for Tenet 3 – Curriculum Development and Support: The school leader should direct teacher teams to  review planned lessons to make certain that they include ongoing checks for understanding; multiple entry points;  explicit strategies for re-teaching; and higher-order thinking questions to support authentic student discussions and high  levels of engagement.   In the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey, over 80% BEES students indicated that they "know what their teacher wants them  to learn in class" and "it is clear what I need to do to get a good grade."    An analysis of BEES NYS Math State Exam Data reveals the following:   Overall Proficiency (Levels 3 and 4) Percentage    2014 - 2.3%   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             16      2015 - 5.5%    2016 - 4.2%    2017 - 13%   2018 - 24%   Proficiency Levels (3, 4) Percentage for Studentds with Disabilities   2017 8%   2018 13%   During the same time period the there was a decrease in the percentage of students scoring at Level 1 on the NYS Math  Exam:   2014 - 47.7%   2015 - 74.0%   2016 - 67.7%   2017 - 54%   2018 - 47%      Formal and informal observations indicate that a need exists for specific planning for and execution of ongoing checks  for understanding; multiple entry points; explicit strategies for re-teaching; and higher-order thinking questions to  support proficiency for all students, specificially students with disabilities.       These data indicate that students with disabilities performance in math is the priority need for the 2018-2019 school  year.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   As a result of using math and special education team meetings to conduct weekly reviews of lesson plans to ensure they  include checks for understanding, multiple entry points, explicit strategies for re-teaching for students with disabilities,  we will see an 7% increase in students with disabilities scoring at levels 3 and 4 on the 2019 NYS Math Exam.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             17        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             18     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   During the 2016-2017 school year BEES was visited by SED Integrated Intervention Team (IIT). The purpose of this review  is to provide the school with feedback regarding the practices across the school and to provide a number of actionable  recommendations to direct the school’s work in the immediate future.    The school leader should direct the Single Shepherd social worker to conduct ongoing weekly teacher trainings on  conflict de-escalation practices and trainings for students to learn behaviors that increase ownership of learning and  promote college and career readiness.   The school leader has instituted programs to address students’ social-emotional developmental health needs. Students  earn Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School (BEES) Bucks for exhibiting positive behavior under the provisions of  the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) program. Students may exchange BEES Bucks for privileges or  inexpensive merchandise. The school leader stated that the PBIS program has helped to improve student behavior and  attitudes in combination with other school initiatives such as the Ramapo program. Students spoke favorably about the  team-building experiences and trips offered through this program. School data reviewed by the IIT showed that  instances of misbehavior have decreased and student attendance has improved since the institution of these initiatives.  However, students told the IIT that although they feel safe in school and the school leader and teachers are supportive  and helpful, there are incidents of bullying and fighting in the school. During the student support staff focus group, the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             25      IIT learned that there has not been training for teachers on de-escalating conflicts and preventing bullying. The school  leader agreed that the Single Shepherd social worker could engage the teachers in this work. The Single Shepherd social  worker has been provided to the school in a city initiative to train students to learn behaviors that increase ownership of  learning and promote college and career readiness. The school leader agreed that teachers could benefit from  additional training focused on building better student behaviors..    Our students, staff and families feel safe and supported as per our most recent QR, PPO visits and NYC School Survey.  100% of our teachers scored Effective or Highly Effective in Advance on component 2D Managing student behavior.  School data collected from students during 'lunch with the Principal' meetings indicate that students would like to  develop better relationships with their peers. Additionally, we have observed that most behavioral incidences occur  when students are in large group settings, such as the cafeteria or gymnasium. Staff at Brooklyn Environmental  Exploration School are invested in educating the whole child, academically, socially, and emotionally, and have put in  place measures to ensure that all scholars are having their needs met in all areas.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment.

During the 2016-2017 school year BEES was visited by SED Integrated Intervention Team (IIT). The purpose of this review  is to provide the school with feedback regarding the practices across the school and to provide a number of actionable  recommendations to direct the school’s work in the immediate future.    Recommendation for Tenet 4 The school leader should engage teacher teams in discussions intended to increase the  use of clearly stated student-friendly learning targets and develop specific next steps to increase the level of student  thinking through ongoing checks for understanding, higher-order thinking questions, and authentic student discussions.   During class visits, the IIT found that instruction was typically teacher-dominated. Teachers introduced the topics,  provided lengthy explanations of the skills to be learned, and conducted large group practice with modeling. Teachers  typically provided limited opportunities for students to engage in deeper thinking and discussion of concepts and  content. In many classes, the review team observed students completing assignments and annotating texts. Students  highlighted vocabulary and sections of the text and wrote definitions and comments. The questions that most teachers  asked often elicited brief responses from students and teachers typically did not pose follow-up questions to encourage  deeper thinking and more complex answers. Classes were orderly and calm; however, teachers rarely encouraged  rigorous thinking and intellectual discovery. • Teachers’ instructional practices did not effectively consider all students’  needs by providing multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning. In observed lessons, some  students expressed confusion and waited passively for further direction. While teachers grouped or paired students to  work together, the IIT saw few instances of students interacting with one another. The IIT observed some students  working independently while others had stopped working. Teachers rarely paused to allow for whole group share-outs  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             29      or to check for students' understanding. During discussions with the IIT, students expressed the view that teachers  should not expect all students to be at the same level and that teachers should provide more opportunities for students  to participate in discussions with one another.   During the 2017-2018 school year BEES was visited by Dr. Miatheresa Pate, Superintendent of CSD 23 multiple times.  Feedback given was As a next step, the principal must collaborate with their Teacher's College partner to ensure that  teachers are able to create opportunities for students to access the content and skill to be learned. This can done via  professional development and creating an observation and feedback cycle that looks for and examines trends around  the practice providing multiple entry points to navigate new learning. Additionally, the principal should build more in- depth context and knowledge around the Five Entry Points to Build Understanding.   Our most recent Quality Review (2014-2015) indicates that "across classrooms, teaching practices reflect an articulated  set of beliefs about how students learn best and incorporate strategies that support students in developing work  products and engaging in discussions at even levels."   In the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey, 100% of teachers indicated that our students built knowledge through content -  rich non-fiction.   In the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey, over 80% BEES students indicated that they "know what their teacher wants them  to learn in class" and "it is clear what I need to do to get a good grade."   An analysis of BEES NYS ELA State Exam Data reveals the following:  Overall Proficiency (Levels 3 and 4) Percentage   2014 - 13.3%  2015 - 5.5%  2016 - 7.3%   2017 - 26%   During the same time period, the percent of students scoring at Level 1 on the NYS ELA Exam was:  2014 - 41.4%  2015 - 63%  2016 - 41.7%   2017 - 30%   These data indicate that student performance in ELA is the priority need for Collaborative Teachers in the 2017-2018  school year.

Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   BEES based on both the NYC School Survey and the School Quality Guide has received high levels of satisfaction and  effectiveness around school leadership as well as trust. The principal attempts to incorporate teacher voice into all  decisions as well as parent voice whenever possible. The school's needs lie in the fact that about half of our teachers are  in the beginning stages of their educational career. Thus, as we move into school year 2018-2019 we want grow the  leadership potential of our teachers within all departments. We can do this by sending teachers to professional  development series at the district level, at the Field Support Center, and through Learning Partners and MSQI. After our  staff attends these professional development sessions, we can have them turnkey the information they learned by  facilitating professional development sessions for relevant teachers upon their return. This cycle of teacher  development and then teacher led professional development using model teachers as facilitators will nurture the  professional growth of teachers and paraprofessionals while keeping the fundamental goal of student learning as our  central focus.   The Advance (teacher evaluation) system indicates that on formal and informal observations, teachers scored an  average of 2.75 (on a 1-4 scale) for effectively using assessment in instruction. This remains a priority need for the 2017- 2018 school year.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             36     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

As a result of frequent announced and unannounced informal observations of all teachers by school leader, aligned  TCCPET coaching with the instructional focus teachers will use higher-order questioning to engage students in authentic  discussions, and we will see an increase in the average teacher rating in component 3b from 2.75 to 3.00 by June 2019.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             37     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

During the 2016-2017 school year BEES was visited by SED Integrated Intervention Team (IIT). The purpose of this review  is to provide the school with feedback regarding the practices across the school and to provide a number of actionable  recommendations to direct the school’s work in the immediate future.    Recommendation for Tenet 6 – Family and Community Engagement: The school leader should expand the existing  Community Circle events to include students’ families in order to strengthen family-school partnerships and increase  family engagement.   Based on our School Quality Guide, parent engagement was one of our lowest indicators. Outside of parent teacher  night which is highly attended, we struggle to get parents actively engaged in the school and our activities. Based on our  NYC School surveys, most families feel welcomed and are invited to events, however consistent turnout is low.   Our priority need that will be addressed in the 2018-19 school year is the continued C growth in our BEES PTA and SLT as  levers for increased individual parent participation rates in workshops and parent teacher conferences.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    In December 2017 Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School was designated "in good standing" by NYSED.  However, we will continue our ELT program in the 2018-2019 school year in order to foster a culture of continuous  improvement. By June 2019 the ELT attendance rate will be at least 60%.        Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?   X   Voluntary      Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   Several specific moves were undertaken to ensure greater than 0% participation in the BEES ELT program.   1. Principal outreach to identified families during the summer (letter in mail, phone call, email)    2. BEES ELT is a partnership between the school and CBO New York Edge / SASF.    3. Participation in the BEES ELT program is required for participation in the New York Edge after school program.   4. Phone calls are made daily to homes of students who do not attend program.   5. Expanded academic course offerings including Algebra for 6th and 7th grade students.   6. Maximum of 10:1 student to staff ratio for academic period.   7. Expanded enrichment activities in STEAM.   8. Weekend enrichment activities "Winter Clubs"        Part 3 – ELT Program Description    The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of  serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47        Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   The BEES ELT period will address all elements of the SED requirements by partnering with New York Edge/(SASF)..    In December 2017 Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School was designated "in good standing" by NYSED.  However, we will continue our ELT program in the 2018-2019 school year in order to foster a culture of continuous  improvement. By June 2019 the ELT attendance rate will be at least 60%.   The school and SASF will continue to meet the SED requirements for the ELT program in a Priority School, however in  December 2017 BEES was designated in "good standing". We will continue to meet the requirements in the following  ways:            Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.   o  The school will partner with New York Edge for three hours per day of after school academics,   enrichment and skill development through their "Champions Club" program.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as   to promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of  graduation   o  The ELT period will begin each day with academic support and small group tutoring periods for   identified students. In addition, select students will participate in an advanced course of Algebra.  Finally, New York Edge allows students to create their own enrichment schedule of courses for their  week of after school programming.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.   o  The New York Edge program has opportunities for students to participate in dance, visual art and   music each day after school.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the   supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.   o  All academic periods will be taught by teachers from the school with a New York Edge tutor as   classroom assistant. In addition, New York Edge must hire an educational specialist who is a licensed k  - 12 special education teacher.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   o  All families are contacted daily regarding their child's attendance and participation in the program.

For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support  your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website:  http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf     Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS      1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your  school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in  DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.)   Currently we  have 16  Students in  Temporary  Housing. This  number is  approximately  15% of our  population.       2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population.   We provide services to our STH population. We provide at least five full uniform sets for each child and provide more  uniforms as the need arises throughout the year. We also ensure that all STH have full access to field trips, class  activities, and senior events by allocating our funds for their participation. We also purchase backpacks with supplies  and age appropriate books in the backpacks so that students are fully able to participate in school and read at home.  Through the Single Shepherd program the school has a social worker who will provide social emotional supports to all  STH students and connect families to area resources. Additionally, metrocards are provided for STH students to  attend all extra curricular programs and Saturday Academies. Finally, we ensure that students have access to our  school food program, know the community resources available to them. BEES has partners with SONYC and New York  Edge to provide after school programming five days per week. This program features a hot dinner served daily.    As a District 23 school, we have a Single Shepherd social worker on staff who supports a cohort of students from 6th  grade to college.

Teachers are integrally involved in developing and selecting performance tasks that measure student achievement  within each unit of study. These tasks are CCLS aligned and promote critical thinking as well as requiring students to  use their higher order thinking skills. Teachers develop these tasks in common planning time and during teacher team  meetings. We also provide professional development around assessments and the use of data to drive instructional  decisions.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             56      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             57      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   BEES will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             58      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             59      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Brooklyn Environmental Exploration School (BEES), in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             60      student achievement between the school and the families.

We use the teacher created assessments and  student work to evaluate student reading levels and comprehension ability. This  data will drive differentiated instruction for our ELLs, as well as determine guided/independent reading levels .   The early data  shows a need for explicit vocabulary instruction.  This has led to a focus in our planning for ELLS and SWD.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We host bi-weekly "Child Study Team" sessions with the Special Ed / ENL / Related service personnel.  We have the progress of  the ENL students on the calendar for the second week of each month.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66          To evaluate the success of our program for ELLs, we will closely monitor progress for all students.  To ensure that we are  meeting AYP for ELLs, we will  -Track students DRP, ANET, Periodic Assessments level.  -Use various assessments to determine levels in listening, reading, writing and speaking.   -Use data from Imagine Learning for identifying student growth.   -NYSITELL and NYSELAT scores, patterns     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We host bi-weekly "Child Study Team" sessions with the Special Ed / ENL / Related service personnel.  We have the progress of  the ENL students on the calendar for the second week of each month.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Using the Standard Treatment Protocol, we will use the data received from (**F&P,**) SOLOM, NYSESLAT/NYSITELL and  regular assessments to determine if our ENLs are in need of intervention to increase their overall English proficiency.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The data reveals different areas of student success, and also areas in need of improvement. We have 1 student at a Beginner  level, 2 at intermediate, and 1 at advanced.  It allows for creation of subgroups of students for targeted, specific programs to  help students have successful academic outcomes.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We host bi-weekly "Child Study Team" sessions with the Special Ed / ENL / Related service personnel.  We have the progress of  the ENL students on the calendar for the second week of each month.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We deliver services through pushing in AND pulling out students.  Integrated ENL will be delivered by co-teaching by  our enl teacher and a certified content area teacher. Our ENL educator works closely with the classroom teacher to  develop the most effective plan for students while pushing in and pulling groups. Depending on needs of students,  groups are formed and may be flexible throughout the year, especially as students grow academically and in their  proficiency.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67                 Our ESL pedagogue creates a schoolwide ENL schedule to ensure all ENL students are serviced most appropriately and  effecively. Schedule is designed for each student considering levels, related services, lunch period, times of core subjects  scheduled, and times of related services. The new CR154-2 chart is also used to ensure each level is receiving the appropriate  number of minutes. Ie: Entering students will receive the same 360 minutes, however 180 minutes will be stand alone ENL,  and 180 minutes will be integrated ENL.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In our ENL program, the ENL and classroom teacher work together to deliver core content with learning objectives and  simultaneously incorporate a language objective to further build English language proficiency. Based on the assessment of  students academic needs, this may be delivered to the entire class, push in or pull out while developed in small group  instruction.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      For our newcomers, we regularly give assessments in the students home language. Many of these students have the  language proficiency of a beginner, but have the academic skills and knowledge for grade level math, social studies and more.  Later we assess with home language book reports, conversations, and other assessments.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status          A. Currently, we do not have any SIFE students. However, an individualized instructional plan for future SIFE students will  receive the mandated amount of ESL instructional minutes as per CR Part 154, according to proficiency level. Their instuction  will be differentiated based on their specific knowledge and needs. Additionally a blended learning model using Reading A-Z,  Rosetta Stone and i-Ready will be put into place in case we enroll any students who are SIFE.  B. Newcomer students are often serviced in small groups with children from mixed level groups until they have acquired basic  inter-communication skills (BICS). Using the SOLOM measuring tool, newcomers are frequently informally assessed in their  speaking and listening skill in order to begin instruction to improve their BICS and later CALPS.  Newcomers also often need to  build foundational knowledge in phonics.   C. Developing students instuction is driven by various assessments to determine and build upon student levels. Students are  given language objectives through content area learning.  D. Long Term ELLs are given assessments to determine which specific areas of english language the student needs to develop.  By targeting the areas they need assistance in, we can help these students reach proficiency.   E. ENL teacher works with classroom teacher to identify english proficiency skills of these students which may still need  intervention     More specifically all ELL students follow an ICT program.  Their classrooms have at least 1 content teacher, 1 Sped Teacher, 1  paraprofessional in addition to services being provided in ESL.  The ICT classes follow the SIOP model for all students in the  class as a means to enhance vocabulary and provide support for ENL students..      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    We currently have ELL-SWDs in Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classrooms.  All students are serviced by an ESL  teacher using the push-in and pull-out approach.  Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principals will serve as a guide to provide  access to academic content areas and accelerate English Language Development.  This method will give each student   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             68      meaningful access to the curriculum by assuring access to the environment as well as multiple means of representation,  expression, and engagement.    The following principles should support English language Development for ELL-SWDS:  1. inclusiveness- a classroom climate that communicates respect   2. physical space- equipment, resources and materials provide access for participation, a little physical effort in obtaining  3. delivery methods- content is delivered and presented in multiple modes  4. information access- use of captions videos, accesible electronic formats and printed work  5. interaction- accessible to everyone, use of multiple ways for students to participate  6. feedback- effective prompting during activity and constructive comments for all studentwork completed  7. demonstration of knowledge- provisions for multiple ways to demonstrate studentwork: group work, portfolios,  demonstrations, and presentations.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use flexibility for our ELL-SWDs. Students may attend lessons in other classrooms in some subject areas, as well as receive  support in small groups to progress to proficiency.  This flexibility gives our students the individualized and differentiated  support they need.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Based on the students needs, various interventions are provided to best accommodate these learners. For students that need  to develop and strengthen phonics skills, they will receive support in Foundations. For students that need to grow in  comprehension, lessons will be targeted accordingly.  For students that need support in math, instruction will be provided to  target academic math vocabulary.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      With more flexible programming and specific targeted instruction for next year, we will assist our students reach their  academic goals.  We feel a move to a flexible schedule, across grades will ease scheduling issues with the shared ESL teacher.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no discontinuation of any programs or services next year.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs including after school and supplemental services. Any before or after  school programs, as well as other programs will be available to ELLs. Notification will be sent home in the families preferred  language to inform about such programs. After school programming is through DYCD and led by a site director.  Under the  direction of the principal the DYCD site director issues notifications in parents preferred home language and provides ENL  students seats in the after school program.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  23k664  Go Math,  and Ready Gen. Based on students needs, different materials are used.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL model, students are offered assessments on a classroom level and state level in their home language. In our ENL  model, we assess listening skills with note taking, revise previous written pieces, assign book reports in l1, and more.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69         Each of our classrooms with ELLs are equipped with age appropriate grade level books and resources. For classrooms in need  of appropriate books, we supply them. For our beginner 6th grader, we are not using big books , but are presented with  information in a more age appropriate and grade level appropriate format.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    23k664  Go Math,  and Ready Gen. Based on students needs, different materials are used.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In order to help ELLs and their families become acclimated to our school, these new students are given an orientation and a  tour of our school. If possible, they will meet their new teacher before the year begins (or before their 1  st   day for enrollment  mid year)    Penny Lewis (Parent Coordinator) supports families who enroll before the school year begins with tours, information and  translation services.  Olga Beylis - ESL Teacher has a "Welcome Night" for ESL families in September.  Tiffany Pierre - School Counselor supports families throughout the year with all issues.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not currently offer any language electives at 23k664     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel at 23k664 attend the congruent PD as general staff in addition to targeted training in NYSESLAT, ELL content  and/or updates, NYSITELL, compliance, LAP/LTI and more. Classroom teachers that work with ELLs will be provied with PD to  improve their practices for ELLs.  Brooklyn North PD series for ELL Instructors  Monday PD Calendar for K664   ELL teachers receive equal support as classroom teachers as they engage in the CCLS . When targeted training and support are  offered, our ELL teachers will attend to further improve practices as they progress and/or change.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  We support our ELL teachers by examining what our students need to move up to their next school, and helping our teachers  provide this to students.       2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70         Our ENL teacher will attend various PD to reach the required number of hours. Through PWeekly and email blasts, we will be  kept aware of PD opportunities. Our school secretary keeps records of PD attended inside and outside the building. Sign in  sheets are kept on file on Room 300A.  Monday K664 PD series once per month focuses on ELL and students with disabilities             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual individual meetings are scheduled with families/parents of ELLs through the ENL teacher and parent coordinator.  Students program goals, language development progress, assessment results, and language needs are reviewed and  discussed.  English-Spanish translation is completed by a bilingual BEES staff member (Mr. Sibilia), Arabic translation is not  required as the two Arabic speaking families speak and understand English.  1.

Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   FOR NUMBER 2 ABOVE---- Written records are kept to keep track of attempts to have annual individual meetings as well as  records of the meetings themselves. These records are stored in the ESL classroomby Olga Beylis.     3. Parental involvement is encouraged to ALL our families, including families of ELLs. School and after-school events are open  to all, and families of ELLs are sent a translated invite or flier informing them of the event(s). For example, we have various  events showcasing our students work throughout the year. We send a notice to parents in their home language. We also  encourage them in our initial registration and meetings to be a part of the school community, and to attend these events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Craig Garber, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
