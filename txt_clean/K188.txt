This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school’s Mission Statement is as follows:   Mission Statement    The Michael E. Berdy School is committed to creating a school environment which teaches all students to respect and  appreciate the diversity of our cultural backgrounds. Our goal is to create a safe, secure environment which will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      nurture our students to develop to their fullest potential. Through our partnership with our parents and community,  we will lead our children to become responsible, educated and informed citizens.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Michael E. Berdy School, P.S. 188, was built in 1923. 21K188 is a Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 5 Title 1  Elementary School located in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. This is a low income community. We have two all  day Pre-Kindergarten classes. We have approximately three classes on each grade from Kindergarten through Grade  5. We service students with disabilities in four self-contained classrooms and five integrated class (grades K, 1, 2, 3,  and 4).   Our current student enrollment is 391. The ethnicity break down at 21K188 is as follows: Hispanic: 35%, African  American: 50%, White: 8% , Asian: 4%, American Indian/Alaskan: 2%, Multi-racial 2% , Gender Make-up: Male- 50%,  Female-50%, SWD- 25%, ENL-7%   Breakdown of the classes for the 2018-2019 school year is as follows: 2 Full day Pre-K classses, 2 Kindergarten classes:  1 Kindergarten General Education and 1 Kindergarten ICT, 1 K/1 Bridge 12:1:1, 2 First Grade Classes : 1 General  Education and 1 ICT Class, 2 Second Grade Classes: 1 General Education and 1 ICT class, 1 Grade 2/3 Bridge 12:1:1, 3  Third Grade Classes: 2 General Education and 1 ICT Class, 3 Fourth Grade Classes: 1 General Education, 1 ICT Class,  and 1 fourth grade 12:1:1 class, 1 Grades 4/5 Bridge 12:1:1, 2 Fifth Grade Classes: Both ICT Settings.    The student body is served by 62 professionals and support staff, including the Principal, 1 Assistant Principal, 1  Universal Literacy Coach, 1 UFT Coach, 37 teachers, 1 full time School Psychologist, 1 full time Social Worker, 14  Paraprofessionals, 2 Secretaries, 2 School Safety Officers, 1 Parent Coordinator, 1 Resource Coordinator, 4 School  Aides, 1 full time Speech Teacher and 1 part time Speech Teacher. 100% of our teachers are fully licensed, certified  and permanently assigned to our school. We also have an in-house U.F.T. Teacher’s Center. For the 2018-2019 school  year there will be five cluster positions; Technology, Physical Education, Library, Dance and Science. Art will be taught  by the classroom teacher one period a week.    Our school is unique, as compared to other New York City schools, because of several projects which we are involved  in. Our school is also the Brooklyn elementary model for a Collaborative Learning School (C.L.S.) environment. We are  committed to developing the “whole child.” We are addressing this goal by building the first Lenscrafters/One-Sight  Optical in a NYC Public School. We house Lutheran Hospital which provides the following services: counseling, basic  physicals, dental service. We are partnered with multiple outside private organizations such as Lutheran Medical  Center; YWCA; counseling in schools; Childmind.org; UFT; and CSA. Our facility has been transformed into the “hub”  of the community and services are directly delivered to the students and the families based upon the needs they put  forward.    During the 2017-2018 school year, we also partnered with and will continue to partner with for 2018-19 school year,  the Positive Learning Collaborative (PLC). The PLC, in conjunction with the United Federation of Teachers and the NYC  Department of Education, provides an intense, on-site and off-site training where staff members learn how to work  with and provide tools to help students monitor and regulate their behavior. All of our seasoned teachers, aides and  paraprofessionals have been trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools (TCIS). Teachers learned various  strategies and skills to help students co-regulate, prevent/de-escalate potential behavioral crises with students, and  how to safely manage crisis situations. All newly hired staff will receive TCIS training this year. We worked and will  continue to work closely with the PLC team on Monday and Tuesday afternoons to devise a plan to help reduce  occurrences in our school.   In our continued work to maintain and establish even stronger community ties we began Tea Time Tuesday. This  allows parents of our Pre-K and Kindergarten students to attend morning class with their children.

They are also given the opportunity to contribute any information that may be helpful  to us. We have also established a School Newsletter where we highlight our celebration and events. The Newsletter  also provides parents and the community with other pertinent information about our school. We have an Honor  Society that celebrate student achievement and we hold assemblies where parents can celebrate in their success.      PS 188K will be implementing TC Reading and Writing Curriculum during the Reading and Writing workshop time. All  students will be responsible for completing Units of Study in writing and completing a writing performance task as a  summative assessment for each unit. In addition to TC Reading and Writing for English Language Arts (ELA) curriculum  we decided that Passport Social studies will be the resource used for all Social Studies units. We will align all Social  Studies units to the writing pacing calendar to reinforce what the students are learning in ELA and carry it over into  our Social Studies content area.   We at PS 188K place a significant emphasis on the important roles that parents, families, and the community play in  raising student performance and closing the achievement gap. We have an active PTA that engages in planning and  facilitating educational, fun and engaging activities for students and families. They also support teachers and staff,  fund events, organize and provide volunteer assistance when needed. We are always striving to maintain and develop  the collaborative partnership between parents, families, the community, and the school.    PS188K is a growing school and community of learners. We are committed to our students, parents, and teachers. We  seek improvements in teaching and learning; we seek knowledge and reform, we seek information and researched  based practices, and we seek and aspire to be the very best. Our students deserve no less. Our teachers and  administrators are eager to support our students and are continuously making changes and enhancements to their  teaching practices. We embrace diversity, respect all cultures and communities and live by our motto – "Reach higher,  be Outstanding, and remain Courteous and Kind" (R.O.C.K.)     3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We currently have 30 ENL students who require services to expand their fluency in English. Based on each students'  status of emerging, expanding or transitioning the students are receiving ENL services by a licensed teacher. The ENL  Teacher provides support to these students based on their ENL status. Based on last year's state data this subgroup  struggles with determining the meaning of general academic and domain specific vocabulary, identifying the main  idea of a story and recalling the details of a story to support the main idea, describing characters in a story and cause  and effect. To accurately diagnose the cause of these deficiencies, further diagnostic assessments will be  administered to identify which of the 5 Pillars of Reading the student is deficient in.    Currently, 27% percent of our student population are Students with Disabilities (self-contained; integrated  classrooms; SETTS related services) students. The breakdown is as follows:   Total number of students with IEPs: 96   Students receiving Related Services only: 69   Self-Contained 12:1:1: 43   Integrated Co-Teaching: 40   Alternate Assessment: 1   SETTS: 12   On the 2018 NYS ELA exam, 6% SWDS were proficient compared to 4% that were proficient on the 2017 NYS ELA  exam.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      On the 2018 NYS Math Exam, 11% of SWDs were proficient in Math compared 12% that were proficient on the 2017  NYS Math Exam.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past year, we have strengthened our family outreach, which was evident in our survey data, where we  showed an increase in this element. Teachers have used Class Dojo to communicate daily with parents, post  homework and share pictures throughout the day with families. Our Community Learning Schools (CLS) Director has  organized several events, such as the CLS Forum and Family Fun Saturdays, which have brought more families into our  school community. With the opening of our Vision Center, parents will now be able to utilize this community resource  to benefit their families.    Our key area of focus for the upcoming school year is in the element of rigorous instruction. We scored significantly  low in this area on the school survey. Also, our state scores from 2017-2018 show that only 27% of our students met  the state standards in both ELA and Math. We will focus on increasing our Level 3's and 4's in Reading and Math by  providing Professional Learning Opportunities and collaborative professional opportunities to our teachers to improve  teacher practice in these core subject areas. We will also be making changes to our curriculum in order to ensure that  all student needs are being met and instruction is rigorous, engaging and differentiated. We will also be providing our  students with academic intervention services, which will allow providers to focus on target standards. These  standards will be determined after analyzing the 2017-2018 state test data.    We set high expectations for all our students at P.S. 188. We believe in a partnership between the parents,  community and school in order for all of our students to reach their potential.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K188   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   437   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As reported by the state via the Student Information Repository System (SIRS), only 22% of our students were  proficient (Level 3's and 4's) in the 2018 ELA State Assessment. Compared to the 27% level of proficiency recorded in  2017, the aforementioned percentage of 22% represents a 5% decrease in the number of proficient students in ELA.  District 21 reported 57% of Level 3's and 4's. This data reveals that there is a 20% gap in reading achievement  between our school and the rest of the district. Further analysis of the data demonstrated the following trends:      From 2017-2018, "Males" recorded a noticeable decline in their levels of proficiency by 6%. Another decline  was noticed by our African American scholars, 29% to 12% of levels 3's and 4's, resulting in a 17% decrease.     Our White scholars have shown a 19% increase in their levels of proficiency from 2017-2018, 28% to 47%. We   have also seen a 4% increase in our Hispanic students from 26%-30%.     Our students with disabilities have shown a 2% increase in proficiency levels.   We recognize that more time needs to be included in the daily schedule to address the deficiency of reading stamina  and higher order thinking skills. The application of guided reading and adoption of instruction, making changes  designed to meet the needs of all students, is essential in providing rigorous instruction, facilitating College and  Career Readiness and preparing the students to meet the CCLS and State Test criteria.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   Through rigorous instruction targeting guided reading strategies that are aligned to the Common Core, by June 2019,  75% of students in grades K-5 will reach their individualized learning targets in ELA as evidenced by TC Running Records.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan     Teachers will receive professional training on effective   All Students   Sept 17 - 21   Administration   application of TC running records and guided reading  instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Through collaboration with the Positive Learning Collaborative (PLC), which is an outside learning consultant and  along with a deeper analysis of the OORS data, we determined that we must focus on making PS 188K a supportive  learning environment for all teachers and students. We currently have 583 occurrences: 12 Level 5, 122 Level 4, 363  Level 3, 59 Level 2 and 27 Level 1. For the 2017-2018 school year, we had 42% of infractions reported in OORS  occurring in classrooms. Out of those reported, 78% were levels 3, 4, and 5. This data will drive our work with the PLC  Team resulting in new procedures and resources for the classroom teachers to help them maintain and foster a safe  and positive learning environment for their students. Our main focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to train the  staff in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Services (TCIS) which will help them learn how to de-escalate situations that  will result in better classroom management, ultimately leading to increased student performance.    We have also partnered with Childmind.org, which is an organization that provides counseling to students in crisis.  They will be utilizing classrooms in our building to meet with students to address their emotional needs. This in turn  will lead to better behavior in the classrooms, which will drop our rate of incidents. There is also Art Therapy offered  in our school to give students another tool to use to deal with their emotional issues. Again, this tool should allow us  to see a decline in classroom incidents.   With the help of the PLC, we have also introduced a Cafeteria and Play Area Rubric, which focuses on the following  three values: Be safe, Be respectful, Be responsible. The language of this rubric is used during lunch time and we plan  on continuing to expand these three values into other areas of the school building, such as the classrooms, hallway,  gym, auditorium, etc.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  Through providing students with a safe, supporting environment, by June 2019, there will be a 20% reduction of  infractions occurring in the classroom as reported by OORS Reports, and removal from the persistently dangerous list.  75% of all Students with Disabilities in third grade will increase one level of reading proficiency as measured by TC  Running Records.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

After reviewing our NYS Math Exam Data from the 2017-2018 school year, we noticed that there was a decrease in  proficiency for our Students with Disabilities. In 2018, we only had 11% of our students with disabilities scoring a level  3 or 4 on the Math state exam resulting in a 1% decrease from the year before. This data will drive our collaborative  work with teachers. Collaborative Planning Opportunities (CPO) have been built into the teacher programs to allow  teacher teams to meet on a weekly basis. During this CPO time, teachers will plan lessons, analyze data, discuss  scaffolds and resources to meet the needs of our students with disabilities in Math in order to raise the level of  proficiency. Our SETTS provider and AIS teacher will push in/pull out and provide additional support for our struggling  students in the area of math.

Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   Through a welcoming school environment and community resources for families, by June of 2019, 75% of parents will  participate in the NYC DOE School Survey with 91% of parents responding positively in this area as evidenced by the  NYCDOE School Survey. This is an increase of 31% and 5% respectively.   This will ultimately result in a 5% increase in attendance of 75% of chronically absent K-2 students, as measured by the  RPCA Report in ATS by June of 2019.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below  the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve  the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools  element, including:     Evidence-based      instructional programs,  professional development,  and/or systems and  structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In an effort to attract and develop high quality teachers to the school , we refer to organizations whose members are  already stakeholders in our school community. We specifically form partnerships with local colleges and universities  throughout New York City. We are strategic in our recruitment process for hiring highly skilled teachers by creating a  plan that involves a collaborative team consisting of administrators, teachers and coaches who review resumes,  interview possible candidates and observe these candidates conducting demonstration lessons in a live classroom  setting prior to determining whether or not this person is hired to work in a high needs school such as PS 188K.  Candidates are usually asked to design a lesson and teach it to a class that may be made up of either General  Education students, English Language Learners students, and/or students with Individual Educational Plans.  Additionally, as a way of attracting highly qualified teachers, we have developed outreach strategies that involve  finding interested candidates using the New York City Department of Education Open Market Hiring System,  reviewing personal recommendations of candidates made by current PS 188K staff members, as well as inviting these  potential candidates to visit our school to get a sense of what our school is like and to conduct demonstration lessons  on site in a variety of content areas, while being observed by an Administrator. Over the years, as part of our plan for  attracting and sustaining highly qualified teachers we have also formed collaborative partnerships with traditional  teacher education institutions such as Teacher's College and Brooklyn College as well as forming partnerships with  alternative licensure programs like NYC Teaching Fellows. Many of these partnerships have also served as a resource  for us in providing professional development for our teachers on a variety of instructional topics. As a school, we are  constantly evaluating and revising the hiring process by using the Department of Education's Open Market Hiring  System, revisiting the roles and responsibilities of teachers and constantly communicating the needs of our school  with all prospective employees, so that they are aware of the expectations at PS 188K and are provided with an  opportunity to continue to be lifelong learners. As a school we encourage our paraprofessionals and student teachers  to continue their education, especially in high need areas such as students that are English Language Learners and  Students with Disabilities. We try to keep an open door policy and welcome all those that are interested and are  vested in making sure that our students are ready to meet the standards and go on to be College and Career Ready.    To ensure that current staff members become highly qualified, each year we conduct a survey using the Basic  Education Data System (BEDS). The BEDS survey is used to determine whether a teacher is considered Highly  Qualified within their current assignment. If a teacher is not Highly Qualified based on lack of college credits, efforts  are made by the principal to meet with each teacher and develop a plan to help the teacher. New teachers who are  not considered highly qualified are provided a mentor with a minimum of 2 weekly meetings.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Those teachers considered not Highly Qualified due to the lack of professional development will develop a  professional development plan with their immediate supervisor to support the teachers’ professional needs.            2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   In an effort to provide high quality professional development for staff members, we analyze student data to  determine areas of need and create and/or seek the appropriate support for students based on these trends. We also  actively look for and/or create opportunities that enable our teachers to develop a deeper understanding of the Go  Math, Passport for Learning and reading curriculum while learning how to provide multiple entry points for students  with disabilities and English language learners.       Additionally, we meet with teachers to discuss their learning style trends so that we can match teachers to the  appropriate professional development offerings. PS188K provides high quality in house professional development,  through our in house instructional leads, as well as utilizing the expertise of outside staff development opportunities  through the BFSC, Teacher's College and TCIS/PLC/PBIS.       The BFSC provides monthly Principal and Assistant Principal professional development workshops on meeting the  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards through the lens of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Using  Formative Assessment, non-fiction Reading strategies and Supporting English Language Learners.  Teachers/ staff members who are involved in professional development workshops are encouraged to turn-key to  their colleagues the information they get from their outside professional development. Teachers who are involved in  professional development series are invited to facilitate professional learning communities whereby the work is  shared, studied and applied across a series of classrooms.    Additionally, to ensure all staff members are equipped to access and utilize the resources they need to learn and  teach we provide technology training for teachers on the newest data systems, programs, and tools, such as SESIS,  Smart Boards, STARS and SchoolNet.    In order to ensure all of the on-going professional development workshops and professional learning opportunities  are improving student outcomes and are applicable to instructional practices, we provide teachers with  opportunities to provide feedback to administration, instructional leads and exit slips at the end of professional  development. The data collected enables us to continue to tailor future professional development opportunities to  meet the needs of our students through our staffs' learning.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The transition plans implemented to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program include preparing students for the transition into Kindergarten. One of the ways students are  supported is by immersing them in a month long unit of study in June in preparation for Kindergarten. The unit  includes lessons that support children’s transitions, by helping them process their feelings about leaving Pre-K and  moving on to Kindergarten. Students learn the differences and similarities between Pre-K and Kindergarten. Through  poetry, songs, and read alouds, students are exposed to kindergarten life. Teachers also bring students to visit the  Kindergarten classrooms. They visit classrooms, observe, and take part in a lesson.    The curriculum takes into consideration the amount of time required for a 4-5 year old child to make a successful  transition into Kindergarten. The dramatic play center is converted into a Kindergarten classroom, giving students the  opportunity to act out their feelings towards the upcoming changes they will face. Parents are invited to a  Kindergarten orientation with their child to explain the curriculum and expectations.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     PS188K has an Instructional Lead Committee, PROSE Committee and a Measures Of Student Learning Committee. All  committees are made up of teachers and administrators who review and discuss, in collaboration with the principal,  the assessment measures available for the school community to select. Teachers who expressed interest in joining  the team were selected with consideration given to make sure all teacher groups were represented. This established  team attended network meetings for training, met with each other and the principal to discuss the options available  and what these choices would mean for all constituents. The collaborative decision regarding assessment selection  was made by the committee for the school based on the best interest of students, time commitment and  administrative guidelines. To support the team decision the Instructional Cabinet, made up of the administrators and  coaches, meet to discuss on-going assessment data, time-line and implications of instruction that impact pacing and  professional development. Outcomes from Instructional Cabinet are then passed along to our Instructional Leads to  turn-key. This results in refined curriculum maps and improved student outcomes related to the Common Core  Learning Standards.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45       2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   The Michael E. Berdy School    Public School 188K    3314 Neptune Avenue    Brooklyn, NY 11224    (718) 265-7580                Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Michael E. Berdy School (P.S. 188K) , in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The CS strategy encompasses the philosophy that a child must be educated holistically. The CS partnership is  integrated into PS 188 through the NYU Langone Medical Clinic and the academic and enrichment programs paid for  by the grant. The NYU Langone Medical Clinic has directly helped to decrease our recidivist student occurrences this  year. Parents referred for outside counseling meet with the Social Worker to discuss options for counseling. The nurse  practitioner works with students to diagnose illnesses and prescribe medication to decrease the amount of time a  student is absent due to illness,   The academic programs are aligned to the instructional focus of the school by providing Math and ELA support to  students identified for at risk services. The focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to identify students in K-2 who  require additional supports. Providing academic supports early will help to fill in any gaps in understanding the  students may have that are and will prevent them from being successful.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, with the support of the District's Early Intervention Program and Reading Rescue, 50% students  identified in grades K-2 as needing additional ELA support will grow one proficiency level as measured by TC Running  Records.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  These goals support the holistic approach to educating a child. These are required components for a child to be  prepared for college. Engaging families in their child's education they are made aware of how they can support their  child at home. When parents are valued for their support they will be encouraged to send their child to school daily  and on time. Increased attendance will in it self be beneficial to a child. In developing a trusting relationship with the  members of the NYU Langone clinic parents will be more open to the supports they provide. This positive relationship  will benefit children who are in need of additional supports. Expanded learning time includes academic interventions  and enrichment activities and is aligned with school-day curriculum and expectations.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessments such as Fountas and Pinnell and The New York City Performance Based Assessment are administered to all  students in grades K – 5.  The results of these assessments indicate that out of 35 ELL students tested, 11.43%  scored on a Pre- Primer Level; 17.14% scored on a Kindergarten Level; 31.43% scored on a First Grade level; 22.86% scored on a Second Grade  level; 14.29% scored on a Third Grade level; and 2.86% scored on a Fifth Grade level.  We will be utilizing programs such as  Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project along with the Wilson Fundations reading program for ELL students on the  Entering/Emerging Level in early childhood. These programs concentrate on the use of phonics, sentence structure and  developing reading and writing skills and strategic behaviors such as one to one correspondance.  Some strategies used to  improve performance in the ELL student in literacy is the combining of the Balanced Literacy Approach, which includes  independent/shared reading, guided reading, literacy centers, literacy circles, writer’s workshops, interactive read aloud and  word study with an innovative close reading program.  The Wilson Fundations are also used for those children in need of  academic intervention in grades 3-5.

The  lessons are age and grade appropriate and include all levels of proficiency.  Emphasis is put on language acquisition from the  Entering to the Expanding Levels through phonics, guided reading and writing, and using writing process skills – prewriting,  drafting, revising, proofreading and publishing. Importance is also given to building on basic vocabulary words to create a more  challenging and rigorous language.  All ELL students also receive daily ELA instruction in their classrooms through reading and  writing while using a variety of programs which include ELL components.  In addition, classroom teachers adapt their lessons  for the ELL student by using prior knowledge, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and by modifying the materials  presented.  By using small group instruction, teachers are able to adapt literature activities, use webs and modify text. All  teachers have access to a Smart Panel in each classroom.  The ENL classroom is provided with Rosetta Stone Language Kits, in  several languages, to further assist the ELL students.  Our school library, classroom libraries, support personnel and literacy  coach all work together to support literacy instruction.  In addition, teachers can select materials that can be used with their  ELL students from the UFT Teacher’s Resource Center.  These materials include library books written in the students’ native  languages, phonics enriched auditory materials and equipment, in addition to several other hands on/tactile teaching  materials.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We will be utilizing programs such as Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project along with the Wilson Fundations reading  program for ELL students on the Entering/Emerging Levels.

What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At P.S. 188 we utilize several summative assessments within the ENL population to identify progress and areas of need.  The  primary assessment is from the Language Power ENL curriculum which assesses different language proficiency skills such as  speaking, listening, reading and writing.   In addition, our ENL population also is assessed with the General Ed population using  teacher made pre-post tests for assessing the grade standards of reading.  Writing assessments are administered through the  Teacher College Reading and Writing Project using Writing Pathways rubrics.  These rubrics identify strengths and weaknesses  for all individual learners; as it dissects each skill of writing such as elaboration and mechanics.  Further, this year we  incorporated a computerized assessment program called I-Ready.  This elaborate program provides periodic assessments to  measure growth in reading and math.  Students are leveled by this program and are provided with tasks to meet their  individual needs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are various structures that we have in place that addresses intervention from the gathered summative data. First, we  have our Response to Intervention (RTI) team who meet periodically to address the summative data and next steps.  Secondly,  there is the Academic Intervention team (AIS) which also uses the summative data to guide instruction.  Our after-school  program, Berdy's Brightest, designs their instruction aroung the summative data of the school.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our RTI Team, which is comprised of our School Assessment Team (SAT), Academic Intervention Service (AIS) providers, school  administrators, our ENL Teacher and other related service providers, meets bi-weekly and is run by our RTI  Facilitator.  Teachers complete comprehensive profiles regarding students and are referred to the RTI committee.  We as a  team provide feedback to teachers on strategies and techniques that should be implemented for student  remediation.  Periodic check-points are made to assess the student’s progress.  Students are looked at on an individual basis  by our School Assessment Team utilizing data from assessments such as Fountas and Pinnell, the NYSESLAT, teacher  observations and report card grades.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL is administered to new entrants whose first language is other than English and who meet the eligibility  requirements.  The NYSESLAT exam is administered in the Spring of every year.  The results determine entitlement for the next  academic year.  Our results from Spring, 2016 indicated that out of 25 students tested, 1 student  performed on the Entering  Level, 6 performed on the Emerging Level, 4 performed on the Transitioning Level and 13 performed on the Expanding Level.  The remaining student has graduated.  Based on our analysis of data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and all relevant results  from the four modalities, we will be focusing on the following in ENL instruction for our grade K – 5 ELL students: Teaching in  the content area for each grade level’s academic and social demands; Enrichment in reading and writing to develop proficiency  in these modalities; Instructional strategies and differentiated instruction to meet the needs of the ELLs; Interim assessments  to differentiate instruction.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher works closely with the data specialist to disseminate the data from the NYSESLAT.  In response to the data  collected, the ENL teacher makes the appropriate adjustments to her curriculum.  ENL students are grouped according to  grade and  reading proficiency levels.  Therefore, the ENL teacher adjusts  the complexity of her tasks to meet the needs of the  ENL students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our school uses a stand-alone and an integrated ENL program which are conducted by a full time NYC and NYS  licensed ENL Teacher.  The program is comprised of 35 ELL students ranging from grades K – 5 with 25.71% of the  students scoring at the Entering Level; 17.14% scoring at the Emerginging Level; 11.43% scoring at the Transitioning  Level and 45.71% scoring on the Expanding Level.  This is based on the Spring, 2016 NYSESLAT and the Fall, 2016   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         NYSITELL exams. Students who scored on the Entering or Emerging level are pulled for a standalone program . These  students pulled out by the ENL teacher and receive instruction in the ENL room.  The groups are grouped by grade, K- 2 being group 1 and grades 3-5 being group 2.  The ENL teacherl primarily follows the Language Power program to  provide language proficiency by using teaching strategies in speaking, listening, reading and writing.  In addition, the  ENL teacher will reinforce the teacher made curriculum maps, aligned unit plans and other common core aligned tools  corresponding to the student’s grade level.  These students will receive 180 minutes of standalone instruction (4  periods a week) and will receive an additional 180 minutes of  in integrated instruction. Students who received a score  on the Transitional or Expanding Levels of the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL will receive integrated instruction where the ENL  teacher pushes into their classroom and works collaboratively with the classroom teacher to provide ENL/ELA  instruction to the ELL students.  This service will be provided 4 periods a week meeting the mandated 180 minutes of  instruction for these students.  Students on the Entering and Emerging Levels receive 360 minutes a week of ENL/ELA  service, 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  Students on the Transitioning and  Expanding Levels receive 180 minutes a week of integrated ENL/ELA service. Students on the Proficient/Commanding  Level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA service.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this moment we do not have a bilingual program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this moment we do not have a  dual language program.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our school offers a Freestanding ENL program which is conducted by a full time NYC and NYS licensed ENL Teacher. The  program is comprised of 35 ELL students ranging from grades K – 5. These students fall within the five proficiency levels  according to the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding.  Students  who scored on the Entering or Emerging Levels receive 360 minutes of instruction per week, 180 minutes in a standalone  program and 180 minutes in an integrated program.  Students who scored on the Transitioning or Expanding Level receive 180  minutes of integrated instruction per week. Students in the standalone program are grouped by grade and proficiency levels,  Entering and Emerging. Group 1 is comprised of K-2nd grade students and Group 2 is comprised of students in grades 3-5.  Students in integrated groups receive ENL/ELA instruction in their classroom with both their classroom teacher and the ENL  teacher. Students on the Commanding Level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA service.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Programs such as Teacher Created Materials – Language Power, which is Common Core aligned, is used to support language  instruction across the curriculum to ensure that our students meet the state standards.  The lessons are age and grade  appropriate and include all levels of proficiency.  Emphasis is put on language acquisition from the Entering to the Expanding  Levels through use of phonics, guided reading and writing, and using writing process skills – prewriting, drafting, revising,  proofreading and publishing.  Importance is also given to building vocabulary words to create a more challenging and rigorous  language.  All ELL students also receive daily ELA instruction in their classrooms through reading and writing while using  teacher made curriculum maps which include the ELL components.  In addition, classroom teachers adapt their lessons for the  ELL student by activating their prior knowledge, using UDL, adapting literature activities, using webs and by modifying text.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Although we do not offer home language instruction, we do have a wide variety of library books, in several languages,  available to all teachers in the Teacher’s Resource Center and in the ENL classroom.  Teachers are encouraged to use the  “buddy system” with students who share the same home language in their classrooms.  In addition, classrooms are equipped  with several computers providing access to programs such as google translate and the Longman English Dictionary. Citywide   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      and state exams are offered in their home language whenever available.  During these exams, students are assigned to  teachers who speak their home language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Presently we do not have any SIFE students in our school but we are prepared to provide them with support using ENL  strategies to address the deficiencies in their English language skills.  We strive for these students to obtain basic  communication and social skills.  Because these students lack grade level proficiency in content areas, the classroom and ENL  teachers will work closely to provide language support in content areas.  Newcomers, ELLs receiving ENL services for less than  3 years, receive additional help in vocabulary, word recognition and speaking.  Read alouds are provided to familiarize  students with the sounds of the English language and to expose students to a higher, more rigorous, level of reading. These  students are also the first to be offered enrollment into the after school programs for small group intervention, which meets 2- 3 days a week. The are also offered enrollment into the afterschool YWCA program where they receive homework help.  In  addition to the mandated ENL service, our ENL teacher will be providing ELL/AIS service for students with 4-6 years of ENL  service, concentrating on reading and writing components.  This will establish a stronger foundation and better prepare them  for the standardized tests during this transitional period.  This Academic Intervention ENL service will be provided one period a  week.  In addition, ELLs with 4-5 years of ENL service and former ELLs who are deficient in areas of mathematics and literacy,  as determined by the state ELA and Math exams as well as teacher assessment, will receive additional AIS services in these  areas for up to 2 years.  These services are provided in a small group setting.  In order to ensure alignment of instruction with  the classroom teacher and with the common core standards, the AIS teacher articulates with the classroom teacher.  This will  help focus on the student’s individual needs as well as help monitor their progress.  These AIS teachers all focus on literacy,  math and state test preparation.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   In alignment with the teacher made  literacy program and the Common Core Standards, the ENL teacher provides instruction  to ELLs and SWDs using close reading passages and open ended questions to develop and enhance understanding at a higher  level.  In addition, Teacher Created Materials – Language Power offers level and grade appropriate lessons focusing on higher  order thinking using vocabulary, reading comprehension and writing.  Special attention will be put on the needs of our special  needs students.  Every service provider has access to their special needs students’ IEPs.  They are required to familiarize  themselves with each IEP so they are aware of the needs of each student and can schedule and plan accordingly.  Classroom  teachers and service providers, including the ENL teacher, continually conference with the Special Needs teacher to ensure  that all mandates, including bilingual instruction, are implemented.  Alternate placement paras assist their students by  providing one to one help in their home language as well as in English. With the variety of instructional materials, in correlation  with the Common Core Curriculum Standards and the ENL Common Core Progressions, these students will use English to  acquire information for the content area by developing skills and strategies appropriate to their level of English proficiency to  collect data, facts and ideas, in addition to using English for self-expression.  They will develop skills and strategies to listen to,  read and respond to oral and written texts.  They will relate texts to their own lives and develop an understanding of the  diverse social and cultural dimensions the texts present. These students will learn to express their opinions and reflect on and  analyze experiences and information from a variety of perspectives.  Through the combination of basic drawings or single word  descriptions to the complexity of writing narratives to develop real or imagined experiences, these students, Entering –  Expanding Levels, will demonstrate increasing sophistication to all aspects of language use.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All classroom teachers and service providers are required to familiarize themselves with each IEP making them aware of the  needs of each student so they can plan accordingly.  All service providers continually conference with the special needs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      teacher to ensure that instruction is modified to address the needs of the child.  With a variety of instructional materials, these  students will use English to acquire information for the content area by using English for self-expression.  They will develop  skills and strategies to listen to, read and respond to oral and written texts.  These students will learn to express their opinions  and reflect on and analyze experiences and information from a variety of perspectives. We offer a variety of extracurricular  and afterschool programs to assist the ELL-SWDs. These afterschool/extended day programs offer small group and  individualized instruction to ensure at-risk students’ attainment of the state ELA and Math performance standards.  We  currently offer the Berdy’s Brightest afterschool program to third, fourth and fifth grade ELL students and SWDs.  Varied  instructional strategies and techniques are implemented to meet students’ learning needs.  While creating programs and  schedules for ELLs and SWDs, all service providers and classroom teachers coordinate schedules to ensure to maximize time  spent with their classroom peers.  Our School Assessment and Response to Intervention Teams develop flexible programming  where appropriate for students.  ELL-SWDs are looked at on an individual basis.  Students are placed in both, ICT and Gen Ed  classes with supports for subjects in which they have demonstrated classroom success. Students’ progress is monitored by the  RTI team and the SAT and modifications are made as needed.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We currently offer the Berdy’s Brightest after school program for third, fourth and fifth grade ELL students.  This program is led  by certified teachers.  We concentrate on improving and enhancing reading and writing skills and to prepare our ELLs, and  other students alike, for the mandated city and state exams. Target groups are determined according to benchmark  assessments, formal and informal assessments and teacher recommendation to the RTI team. Our ENL teacher will provide  additional ELL/AIS for students with 4-6 years of ENL service, concentrating on reading and writing components.  This will  establish a stronger foundation and better prepare them for the standardized tests during this transitional period.  This  Academic Intervention ENL service will be provided one period a week.  In addition, our 4th and 5th grade students who are  deficient in the areas of mathematics and literacy, as determined by the state ELA and Math exams as well as teacher  assessment, will receive additional AIS in those areas.  The Science teacher works with targeted groups providing science  hands on instruction through the use of the FOSS Science Program. Classroom teachers provide a focused, grade appropriate,  social studies curriculum.  Both subject areas concentrate on the needs of the ELL student and are provided in a small group  setting. The AIS teacher pushes into their assigned classroom.  In order to ensure alignment of instruction with the classroom  teacher, the AIS teacher articulates with the classroom teacher periodically.  This will help focus on the student’s individual  needs as well as help monitor their progress. There are formal and informal assessments being conducted periodically.  AIS  teachers will focus on literacy, math and test preparation.  Programs are conducted in English and are translated in Spanish,  Russian and Arabic, by our bilingual interpreters, whenever possible       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are fortunate enough to be one of the many schools chosen for the Community Learning School Initiative. With the  funding of major corporations, through the help of the United Federation of Teachers, we are able to invite representatives  from Price Waterhouse Financial to introduce and inform students of financial matters to prepare them for their  futures  Representatives from the Bricks 4 Kidz Program, where classes are taught as a whole, demonstrate how to build with  Legos, and other mechanical pieces, and, in turn, allow the students to replicate and construct their own creations.  We've  opened a clinic with providers from NYU/Langone Hospital who address the physical and mental needs of our students. This  clinic will also provide eye care through a state of the art vision center.  Full comprehensive optical care and exams will be  provided to every student as well as glasses, if needed. In addition, it has a fully staffed counseling department which address  the mental health needs of our students and their families. This clinic also provides full comprehensive dental care to our  entire student population. These programs will be addressing the child as a whole.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We've never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      After school programs and extracurricular activities are always first offered to our ELL students.  Translated notifications are  sent home with each ELL student whenever new programs and activities are made available.  In addition, phone calls, in their  home language, are made by our bilingual interpreters to homes requiring translations.  Priority is given to the ELL student for  the Volunteer Tutoring Program where volunteer tutors sit with students during their lunchtime and provide help in content  areas.  The ELL student is also the first to receive AIS services in Math and Reading, concentrating on grade level materials to  assist them with classroom assignments. We currently offer the Berdy’s Brightest program after school, two days a week.  Here  students receive help in literacy, math and test preparation.  Students are arranged in small groups allowing the teacher to  focus on individualized needs.  We offer Saturday Family Fun Days twice a month focusing on specific needs of the family. Here  we are able to focus on the parents as well as on the students, teaching them how to help their child.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Currently our ENL teacher uses the Teacher Created Materials – Language Power ELL curriculum.  In addition, the ENL teacher  is focusing on aligning lessons to the teacher made curriculum literacy program that is used by all grades.  All classroom and  cluster teachers are provided with a smartpanel to promote learning through technology.  Each fifth grade student, including  ELLs, is provided with a netbook to support computer assisted instruction: researching the internet and utilizing technology  tools.  These skills equip the student with the necessary skills and experience for success. Integrating the use of technology  into curriculum area lessons involves students in real-life applications of the computer.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   PS188 offers an ENL program at our school. We have a wide variety of library books and dictionaries, in several languages,  available to all teachers in the Teacher’s Resource Center and in the ENL classroom.  Computers are provided in each  classroom to be used to provide visual and auditory assistance to our ELL and all students alike. We provide the Rosetta Stone  Language Kit to assist our Newcomer students.  These are available in the ENL teacher’s classroom.  Teachers are encouraged  to use the buddy system with students who share the same home language in their classroom. Students are also “buddied”  with staff members who speak their home language.  The Math and Science State exams are offered in English, and in select  languages other than English, to all students. Students have the option to take the exam in English or in their home  language.  If the exam is not available in their language, they could choose to have a translator during the exam.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    While articulating with each classroom teacher, our ENL teacher will identify skills and techniques used by the classroom  teacher in each grade allowing the ENL teacher to align the ELL lessons according to their age and grade level.  All students  receiving AIS are arranged in homogeneous groups by grade.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We currently do not share a building.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We coordinate with local Community Based Organizations (CBO) who have daycare and Pre-K programs and arrange for them  to visit our facility with their students and families during the Spring term prior to their Fall enrollment.  During the school year  we buddy up the Newcomer ELL student with a student and staff member who speaks their home language.  Student and  parent workshops are given upon their arrival at PS188.  With the assistance of the Parent Coordinator, we help our new  families to enroll in services such as the SNAP program and health services.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In addition to the mandated school district workshops attended by our ENL teacher, our ENL teacher attends professional  development sessions to learn innovative ENL strategies which are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and ENL  Common Core Progressions. These workshops will equip the ENL teacher, who will turnkey to the classroom teacher and para  professionals, with the knowledge required to assist the ELL students with the most up to date ENL strategies.  Professional  development is provided to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of ELLs. In accordance to CR  Part 80, a minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers is dedicated to language  acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for  ELLs while the ENL teacher receives at least 50% of the required PD in these same areas.  Professional Development is offered  by the United Federation of Teachers and the Department of Education throughout the year.  Our ENL teacher turnkeys  information from these workshops by conducting staff development during our Monday Professional Development allotted  time.  In addition, through articulation between the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers, we are able to determine the  agendas for future professional development.  Our focus is to provide new and experienced teachers with the skills and  strategies needed to instruct their ELL students as well as to fulfill the new teacher training requirements.  Teachers will be  trained in using manipulatives which promote the use of language.  Professional development will include hands-on activities,  training and observation in holistic learning methods, second language acquisition themes and different forms of  assessments.  A log is kept in the main office of new teacher mandated training hours.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As previously mentioned, our ENL teacher attends professional development sessions to learn innovative ENL strategies which  are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  These workshops will equip the ENL teacher, who will turnkey to the  classroom teacher and para professionals, with the knowledge required to assist the ELL students with the most up to date ENL  strategies.

Our ENL teacher receives a minimum of 50% of this PD dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core  content area instruction.  All professional development will be facilitated by outside Department of Education and United  Federation of Teachers employees. Attendance sheets and agendas will be kept in the main office.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our Parent Coordinator supports our ENL teacher by conducting outreach to our parent population via letters and phone  conversations, with the help of our bilingual interpreters.  In addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations  and quarterly progress meetings, meetings with ELL students’ parents are organized during our Tuesday parent involvement  sessions. Here the ENL teacher, and other pertinent staff members, update the ELL parents of their child’s progress and discuss  the goals of the program, the results of assessments given to the student and language development needs in content  areas.  Our bilingual interpreters will be made available for each meeting when needed.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We implement a Family Fun ELL Saturday Program with a different focus each session.  Here ELL students and their parents  engage in workshops; providing hands on learning activities for real life problems.  One Saturday per month is devoted to  academic and recreational activities for ELL students and their parents to engage in collaboratively. For example on Family Fun  Saturday ELL students and their parents have the opportunity to conduct experiments under the supervision of a licensed  teacher or acquire the knowledge and assistance to fill out applications of various types. During the upcoming academic year,  we anticipate to provide a parent program to aid parents in becoming more proficient in the English language.  This will allow  the parents to help their children with their academics, making them more college and career ready.  Through our Community  Learning School we currently offer a GED program to all parents, including ELL parents, who are seeking to further their  education. In addition, the Parent Coordinator together with the school instructional coach conduct "Dad's Day" which allows  fathers to participate in a school day, including a workshop.  The workshop informs fathers, including ELLs, of instructional  practices used in the classroom and how they can assist their children at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Frederick M. Tudda, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Michael E.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We at PS 188 utilize the DOE Translation Unit to translate telephone messages and documentation sent to  parents. Our Bilingual Interpreters, consisting of staff members who speak Spanish, Russian, Urdu and Arabic, are  made available as translators to communicate with parents whose home language is other than English. Every  year a “needs survey” is sent home, in English and in other home languages, asking to convey to us how the  school can assist their needs. Upon registration, parents fill out an HLIS form which asks parents for their language  of preference for verbal and written notifications. Although we do not have a large ELL population, according to  information on the HLIS form, Student Registration Form, the RCPL report and students’ blue cards, some parents  have asked to receive letters/documentation in their home language. After the completion of the HLIS form and  the informal oral interview between the parent and the ENL teacher, or designated pedagogue, their home  language is entered into ATS using their proper OTELE codes. During PTA meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences  or other pertinent meetings, our Bilingual Interpreters are made available to help those parents.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69       2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We at P.S. 188 ensure that limited-English-proficient families are contacted in the event of an emergency by utilizing  our school messenger system. Messages are translated into the available languages by our bilingual translators. We  keep current records in the main office for immediate access to each student’s emergency contact. Primary languages  are noted on each student’s card so that we could provide the appropriate language translation. When needed, we  call upon the over-the-phone interpretation and translation services.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At the beginning of every school year, the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit sends a Language Access Kit  which includes a Language Identification Guide to help determine the language spoken by a parent, an informational  brochure about the services provided by the DOE's T&I Unit and an over-the-phone card for school safety agents that  outlines how to obtain an interpreter. This is intended to be used to notify the school staff of the Language Assistance  Services available. In doing so, the Language Access Coordinator will distribute the Language Identification Guide to  the staff and train office staff in using the guide to help determine the language spoken at home by a parent. The LAC  will also distribute the over-the-phone card to safety agents and remind them of the steps on how to obtain an  interpreter for LEP visitors to the school. In addition, the LAC will send a letter to the staff twice a year reminding  them of their responsibility to communicate with LEP parents, and the resources available to them to do so.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Chancellor's Regulation A-663 states that "schools and offices are responsible for providing each parent whose  primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent  Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. It also states  that schools and offices must post in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance to such school a sign in  each of the covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation  services". At the beginning of every school year, the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit sends a Language  Access Kit which includes a Language Identification Guide to help determine the language spoken by a parent, an  informational brochure about the services provided by the DOE's T&I Unit and an over-the-phone card for school  safety agents that outlines how to obtain an interpreter.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent surveys/questionnaires are distributed throughout the year to notify parents of programs available to students  and parents and to gather feedback from parents regarding these services. We also utilize our website to  communicate with parents and inform them of important upcoming dates such as administration of state exams,  Parent Teacher Conferences, report card distribution, parent workshops and PTA meetings. The LAC, together with  the parent coordinator, ensures that bilingual interpreters are available to translate for those parents who speak a  home language other than English.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73
