The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      The staff and students of Peter Van Alst/PS 171Q will engage in rigorous instruction by increasing our focus on  Vocabulary/Word Work development in all content areas. We will partner this with an increase in stamina,  elaboration and volume in writing to prepare the children to have a strong audience appropriate voice in the the  world         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 171 is a Title I elementary (Pre-K-5) school, located in Astoria, Queens. We serve a population of about 500  children. Our students represent the multi-ethnic, multicultural neighborhood of Astoria, where many new  immigrants arrive daily. There are over 20 nationalities represented among our students. Over 19.4% of our children  are English Language Learners and over 70% of them come from homes in which languages other than English are  spoken. Spanish is the predominant language spoken by our students. However, we also have students who speak  Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Chinese, Portuguese, and Farsi. The school population comprises 24% Black, 50%  Hispanic, 4% White, and 22% Asian students. The student body also includes 20.4% special education students. Boys  account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. The average attendance rate for the school year  2017-2018 was 92%.      PS 171 has brought many collaborations with a variety of strategic community programs. Key partnerships include but  are not limited to: Zone 126, City Year, Jacob Riis, HANAC, The Boys and Girls Club, NY POPS, CUNY Creative Arts,  Turtle Bay Music School, Community Word Project, Queen Zoo, Museum of Natural History, Dancing Classrooms,  Move to Improve and Flushing Town Hall. Zone 126 is a cradle to college program, providing services and workshops  to parents to help them prepare their child for college. Additionally, they provide a summer camp program for  students and help the school raise funds for student programs through donors in the community. New this school  year: Federally funded Community School Board.   This year, PS171 has been able to continue demonstrating our commitment to the arts by integrating arts into our  curriculum maps. This year our music teacher has introduced "Music and the brain" to our kindergarten students. This  program was , "inspired by neurological research linking music and cognitive development".    Results from our Spring 2018 state exams indicate that 31% of our students scored on or above proficiency level in  ELA and 35% of our students scored on or above proficiency level in Math. Our school leadership teams have  identified key elements for overall school improvement, founded in the six elements of the Framework for Great  Schools. Further specific details are provided in this document      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Two special student populations are identified at PS 171, our special education and ENL students. Combined, this  special population represents nearly 40% of our school population. In addition, we have students who are both ENL  and SWD. It is a significant number of students and a disproportionate number are not successful on the ELA or  statewide Math examinations. Specifically, when we analyzed our data, it was determined that our combined ELL  population had a modest increase in proficiency that from 2017-2018 of 5%. In our SWD population there was a       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      similar increase of 3%. While we respect modest gains, we realize that we must continue our efforts to develop a  framework for a great school.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   x   x   x               Part 1b.

Based on results from our school survey, it was determined that parents would like to hear more about their child’s  performance in school, and the content of the curriculum they’re engaging in on a daily basis. Parents requested  support in helping their children complete homework assignments, and reinforcing strategies that are taught during the  school day. We provide Homework Help each Tuesday for parents to work alongside a teacher. We encourage teachers  to call home to all students to celebrate each child. All correspondence is sent home in the four languages - English,  Spanish, Arabic and Bengali. In addition, we have posted each grade curriculum map on our web page in English/Spanish  for the parents to have live time access.      To improve on our feedback about student performance in our school, we will consult with parents regularly about how  the school can improve its communication strategies through the SLT and a suggestion box. We will provide  opportunities for families to understand the testing process and criteria used to evaluate their children. We will offer  individual support to enable families to understand the academic expectations, assistance, and progress that their  children are making.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Development of the Advanced Literacy Team has been developed to provide the staff with opportunities to  collaborate within and among grades to develop a cohesive curriculum and plan to support the needs of all students.  The core team, with at least one representative on each grade, meets bi-weekly to discuss the needs of each grade to  decide the best course of action. Grade level meeting opportunities are provided through common planning time with  common preps and professional learning on Mondays to allow time for each grade to discuss their areas of strength  and weakness. The results are then shared with the core literacy team so that appropriate professional learning is  given, appropriate materials are ordered, and curriculum writing is done to meet the needs of all students.              4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   X     N/A     X     X     N/A     N/A     X      Column B   Section Reference(s)  5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E     N/A     5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E     5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E     N/A     N/A     5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E      Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65       Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Peter Van Alst/PS171Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Peter Van Alst/PS171Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to volunteer;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter and web publication designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   * Administration maintains an open door policy to provide support to all parents       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69            School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Peter Van Alst/PS171Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

Beginning in mid- November 2018 through the Spring of 2019 we will offer an after school  and Saturday Academy for ELLs in grades K to 5.  Funding will determine the number  of  Saturdays.  The program will consist of 4 groups capping at 15 students each.  Practice will  be provided to move our ELL students forward at least one level on the NYSESLAT Test.          We will also offer a 15 week after-school program for Kindergarten through 2nd grade. The  students will meet twice a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 -3:30. All  Kindergarten through 2nd grade ELLs will be invited to the after-school program. The after- school program will meet for a total of 120 minutes per week and the amount of students in the  program will not exceed 15. We chose to focus on Kindergarten through 2nd because the past  three years of NYSESLAT scores illustrate that Kindergarten has the highest amount of ELLs  reaching commanding level (proficiency level).     As mentioned above our Saturday Academy for ELLs will consist of two groups. These two  groups will meet from 8:30-10:30 for a total of 15 sessions.  Each group will meet for a total of 1  hour in the computer lab and one hour in the classroom.   Students in our Saturday Academy for ELLs will focus on non-fiction literacy because our  available data states that our ELLs did not meet the AYP in this area. Our program of choice for  reading is Exploring Nonfiction, A Differentiated Content-Area Reading Program by Teacher  Created Materials. The focus of this program is to develop students’ nonfiction reading skills and  strategies. Our ELLs struggle with nonfiction comprehension because they have not yet acquired  the language proficiency needed to succeed in understanding subject matter content. Data  supplied by the science teacher and classroom teachers that teach social studies and literacy  shows that due to content vocabulary deficiency students cannot comprehend text. Also, in house  assessments, quizzes and oral responses show that our ELLs need extra support in content areas.  Because the language of academic subjects requires a high degree of not only reading and  writing ability but also content vocabulary ELLs experience immense difficulties in content area  subjects. Based on the non-fiction reading selections we will engage our ELLs in Narrative  Nonfiction writing. Grades 1-2 will be working on Level 2 of the Exploring Nonfiction Reading  Program while Grades 3-4 will be working on Level 4.    B.  We will support our Literacy Program, which as mentioned above, will focus on non fiction  reading and writing with a main concentration on content area subjects taught in English with  monthly projects. We will invite both ELLs and their parents to work on these projects together  at home. If parents need additional support to complete projects, parent volunteers  will provide  support in their native home language in our parent room 122.  Our goal is to engage student  interest in content area subjects as well as familiarize the parents with content their children are  learning. These projects will be presented by the students as part of the ELL Saturday Academy.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Students will also be given time to conduct research. One of the chapters in Level 2 focuses on  Life in Plymouth Colony. The project for this chapter may ask students to compare the kitchen  described in the reading to a modern kitchen. Students may be asked to both illustrate and write  about the similarities and differences. Students may also be asked to write something in their  own lives related to the kitchen. Students will be asked to keep the main idea in mind because  this is the focus of the chapter.   Our after-school program for Kindergarten students will follow the same supplemental  curriculum Students will meet in the classroom for 60 minutes on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  The first 20 minutes of each session will start with test prep. On Wednesdays students will  prepare for Speaking and Writing. On Thursdays students will prepare for Listening and  Reading. These supplemental materials  will be using the New York ELLs from Continental  level Kindergarten. The remaining 40 minutes will be spent on both non fiction reading and  writing. Our program of choice for reading is Exploring Nonfiction, A Differentiated Content- Area Reading Program by Teacher Created Materials. The focus of this program is to develop  students’ non fiction reading skills and strategies. Our ELLs struggle with non fiction  comprehension because they have not yet acquired the language proficiency needed to succeed  in understanding subject matter content. Because the language of academic subjects requires a  high degree of not only reading and writing ability but also content vocabulary ELLs experience  immense difficulties in content area subjects. Based on the non-fiction reading selections we will  engage our ELLs in Narrative Nonfiction writing. Kindergarten will  be working on level 1 of  the Exploring Nonfiction Reading Program. Students will learn to label items in non-fiction  passages that will later lead to vocabulary words for writing.  All records and attendance will be  maintained by the ENL teachers, and communication with parents will be sent in both English  and Parent's preferred language with copies kept in school.    C.   We will also invite students and their parents to the Hall of Science. This trip will be held on  the weekend. Students with their parents will meet with two ENL Certified Teachers and one  Supervisor at the Hall of Science. This year the Hall of Science dedicated its lower level to Little  Makers. Here students will be able to experiment, design, build and invent. We are planning this  trip in early spring so that students can apply the knowledge they gained through our program.  We feel this will be a great opportunity for both students and their parents. Following this trip  students’ will be asked to bring in the item they have designed, built or invented at the Hall of  Science. Students will be responsible to prepare an oral presentation based on the item they will  bring in. We will work with students so that they have the necessary vocabulary to provide an in- depth oral presentation. This will be an exit project.  We will have parent volunteers provide translations in the language of need.    D.   In addition to our focus on nonfiction Literacy, mainly targeting core subject areas, we will  also prepare students for the NYSESLAT. We will be using New York ELLs from Continental.  This program provides practice in the various question formats of the 2018 NYSESLAT and help  students’ transition to NYS Common Core ELA test. On the first and third Saturday of the month  students will explicitly practice both Speaking and Reading components of the NYSESLAT.  Students will be presented with speaking practice and reading comprehension activities. On the  second and fourth Saturday of the month our focus will be on the Listening and Writing  components of the NYSESLAT. Students will be asked to listen to various texts and produce  written responses. These responses will be corrected by the ELL Teacher and feedback will be  provided to the students. Based on areas of need differentiated small group instruction will be  developed.   PS171Q will only have the ELL Academy on Saturdays. Therefore, the administrator will be  funded through the Title III plan. However, the administrator for the after-school ELL program  for Kindergarten will not use Title III funds.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information          Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                    ELL instructors  will attend a workshop provided by the Assistant Principal in November. The  title of this workshop is Disaggregating the Data. This workshop will allow both the ENL  Coordinator and ENL Teacher of Title III to closely look at the data pertaining to students  enrolled in the Title III program. Based on the knowledge gained both instructors will be able to  have a full understanding of each student. This workshop will take two hours and will be held on  December 3, following the Title III ENL Saturday Academy Program. Title III instructors will  also attend a workshop held by the Science Teacher titled Content Area Vocabulary. This  workshop will focus on grade appropriate content terminology. This workshop will allow both  instructors to appropriately plan their lessons taking into consideration grade appropriate content  area vocabulary. This workshop will be held on December 5th and will be one hour.   Also,  instructors will have time allocated to watch the webinars provided by the Exploring  Nonfiction Reading Program. In addition to this  instructors will meet once a month to plan the  upcoming chapter of Exploring Nonfiction. During this time both ELL teachers will also be give  ample time to print and analyze MindPlay reports. Based on these reports differentiated groups  will be created.   The PD provided will ensure that the instructors are using the most current data available to  modify their lessons to best meet the needs of the students. In addition, it will allow them to  develop plans that reflect the various strategies they use in their planning. In order to ensure that  growth is constant, PD will be provided to the instructors monthly, as a review of the data as it  becomes available, as well as during the day during Monday PD sessions.  Agendas and attendance sheets will be available and collected by the supervisor in charge at the  time of the PD. The PD is at no cost to the Title III funds.        Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities       how parents will be notified of these activities   Begin description here:                Written communication, in appropriate language, will be sent home describing our Title III Plan.  These notifications will address content, time, location and duration. Once a parent shows  interest (registers their child into the Title III Saturday  Academy program), an invitation for the  Program will be sent home along with Parent Meeting information. During this initial meeting  parents will have the opportunity to meet the instructors, hear about the program and ask any  questions they may have. Translators will be available for all meetings. Also, all meetings will be  led by the Program Supervisor, ELL Coordinator and ELL Teacher.  Parents will be invited to accompany their children to the Hall of Science, where students will  utilize all the knowledge they have gained to invent, design, or built an item of choice. Parents  will also be asked to join us during our exit project oral presentations. These oral presentations  will be held during our last week of Title III sessions. We believe parent presence during these  presentations will be beneficial to both the students and their parents. As mentioned above,  students will be responsible to prepare these presentation based on what they have built,  designed, or invented during the Hall of Science trip. We believe students will receive parental  help with creating these projects. Invitations in necessary languages will be sent to parents.   This year PS 171 will  continue to provide ESL classes twice a week to Parents of ELLs. These  sessions will be 1 hour each, held on Fridays from 8:10AM to 9:10AM. They are of no charge to  Title III. Parents of Title III students will receive invitations to these classes. Attendance is taken  so it will be easy to monitor how many parents attend classes. Also, the Parent Coordinator  provides many workshops in both English and Spanish. Title III parents receive invitations to all  workshops.     Parent workshops will be made available with the assistance from the Parent Coordinator, who  sent out a survey to gather data on the needs of the parents. In addition, based on the School  Report, Communication is a component that we would like to improve on, based on the parent  responses. Agendas and attendance sheets will be distributed, collected and maintained by the  supervisor.   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 171 Q uses the TCRWP to assess all of our students. Each child is tested within the first four weeks of school. The data is  entered into the assessment site (Assessment Pro). Last year’s data showed that a large percent of our ENL learners scored  below the recommended grade level in reading. Students are given a goal to attain by the end of the school year and their  progress is monitored monthly by administering a Running Record to track progress.  In addition, the school will be utilizing  MyOn which is a site where students will be administered an assessment to find their areas of strength and weaknesses, to  develop their skills and have resources to books online that are available specific to their levels. Assessments are included in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81      this program to monitor student growth. Books on the site are also offered in other languages.  Once data is available we will  further elaborate on the findings.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Available data is made available to the staff and a meeting is held with administration and the LAP team to discuss findings,  concerns and next steps. Staff is also provided with the resources to administer the Running Records, as well as a checklist on  the due dates of completion. A Running Record goal sheet is provided for setting student reading goals and tracking progress.  Additional staff is provided, if necessary, to adhere to the time line completion of the assessment. Staff then discusses data  and includes enrichment activities in their planning necessary for student progress. Training for MyOn is provided and  continued support on how to best use the available resources for the students, specific to their needs. The ENL coordinator  will provide further support based on staff and student needs, as well as provide in-class support. Administration will utilize  observations to monitor what systems are being carried out successfully and have on-going discussions with the staff based on  findings.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELL program based on an in depth analysis of the annual NYSESLAT results, running records,  chapter reading and math tests, teacher made assessments, site word assessments and writing samples. In the upper grades  we also analyze ELA and Math state test scores and refer to the item analysis. In addition, their progress will be monitored  using the iReady reading program we will also incorporate this year.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Data is made available to the staff and a meeting is held with administration and the LAP team to discuss findings, concerns  and next steps. Monthly meetings will be held to monitor progress and address any misconceptions and/or modify planning, as  well as decide what Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions are needed.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Data used to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework consists of but is not limited to:  Fountas and Pinnell Running Records in grades K to 3 and Teachers College Running Records in grades 4 and 5, iReady results,  content area rubrics and teacher observations. Based on these assessments areas of need are targeted. In the upper grades (3- 5) a City Year member is present during the entire day in the classroom. City Year members work with small groups providing  differentiated learning. Our IEP pedagogue also pushes into ENL classrooms. Supplemental programs in literacy, the arts, and  math are offered after school and on Saturdays.  Tier 1 services will be delivered by classroom teachers and content specialists (music, science, technology, physical education,  art, library).  Tier 2 services will be delivered by RTI providers.  Our school will be utilizing iReady, a research based computer program,  which targets individual needs of the student.  Tier 3 services will be delivered by RTI providers, SAT pedagogue, and Guidance Counselor. iReady, At Risk Speech and SETSS,  and Inspire Program..        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data reveal that  their is limited student growth. From Kindergarten to grade 1 there was a 42%  increase, however, there was no increase from grade 1 to grade 2; 10% increase from grade 2 to grade 3; 25% increase from  grade 3 to grade 4; and 36% increase from grade 4 to grade 5. Further data reveals that those same students who showed  minimal growth in NYSESLAT, also did not meet the standards for the NYS ELA and Math assessments.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82         September 2108, ENL students will continue to be in ICT classes to benefit from the instruction of two highly qualified  teachers.  Academic groups for learning will be according to language acquisition ability levels as well as proficiency levels on  the ELA/Math tests.  Teachers will continue to go for professional learning in the area of ENL as well as the 6 ICT models given  by DOE and District 30.  Teachers will be provided with prep time to curriculum plan on their grade levels.  Teachers will be  provided with professional engagement time on Mondays and Inquiry Team time on Tuesdays.  All curriculum planning will  incorporate points of entry and scaffolding strategies to meet the needs of our ENL students.  Monthly curriculum guides,  Tuesday parent engagement time, open school, phone calls home, cellular apps and parent events will provide opportunities  for parents to participate in the learning process.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS171Q will provide ELLs with both Integrated and Standalone ENL as implemented per CR Part 154.2. In grades  1, 2,  3, 4, and 5 ELLs will be placed in self-contained ENL classrooms with dually certified teachers; ENL and common  branch. Students, depending on their individual ENL schedule (which will be kept by teacher), will receive the  mandated amount of units in both integrated and standalone ENL. The ENL Coordinator will also visit these  classrooms to provide additional support during standalone ENL units. In grades 2 and 3 all ELLs will be provided with  both push-in and pull-out services. The ENL Coordinator will push-in on Fridays during Content Area specifically Social  Studies to both 2nd and 3rd grade for two blocks. The ENL Coordinator will also push-in during ELA and Math in both  2nd and 3rd grade. Integrated ENL will also take place during ELA, Math and Social Studies. Stand-Alone ENL will be  provided by the ENL Coordinator in grades 2 and 3. The ENL Coordinator will work with small groups of ELLs in the  back of the room. In all grades the ENL Coordinator will push-in during literacy to provide differentiated instruction to  small groups of children. Students will be grouped by proficiency levels or strategy groups depending on topic of  focus.   All Entering and Emerging students receive 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during  ELA and Math. Transitional students receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone units and 90 minutes of Integrated ENL during  ELA and Math. Expanding students do not receive any Stand-Alone units just 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during  ELA and Math. Stand-Alone units are provided in the mornings. During this time the ENL teacher works with ENL  students in the back of the room in small groups based on student need.  Students who have reached the  Commanding level continue to receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               Based on NYSESLAT results all students have individual schedules illustrating the amount of ENL instruction they need.  These schedules are kept by the teacher and Assistant Principal and ENL Coordinator.  All students receive the mandated       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83      amount of both integrated and stand-alone ENL instruction.All Entering and Emerging students receive 180 minutes of Stand- Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math. Transitional students receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone  units and 90 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math. Expanding students do not receive any Stand-Alone units just  180 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math. Stand-Alone units are provided in the mornings. During this time the ENL  teacher works with ENL students in the back of the room in small groups based on student need.  Students who have reached  the Commanding level continue to receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math.   Students with Disabilities  will receive mandated services by being in an ICT/ENL classroom, with two certified teachers holding licenses in ENL and  Special Education.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In PS 171 we try to apply the Cognitive Academic Language Approach which is specifically designed to help students make  the transition from ENL classes to mainstream, content-area classes. This approach is based on the belief that content-rich  lessons are interesting and motivating for students. ENL teachers along with the ENL Coordinator work with students in the  classroom and during pull-out and push-in sessions as per each students mandated time. On different grades ENL teachers use  different ways of organizing the classroom, designing curriculum, and presenting lessons. However, all teachers prepare  interactive lessons with hands-on activities and cooperative learning. In each setting creativity and discovery are encouraged.  All teachers provide students with flexibility and versatility. All ENL students follow the same curriculum as mainstream  students on the same grade level. The curriculum is adapted to the needs of each ELL. The integration of language skills,  thinking skills and content knowledge are emphasized.   The ENL Coordinator pushes in to grades K and the 12:1:1 classrooms, provide Integrated ENL instruction. In grades 1-5 the  ENL classroom teacher provides Integrated ENL instruction. Grades 2 and 3 have science twice a week, which is provided by  our science cluster. During this time the classroom teacher will work with the science teacher to provide Integrated ENL  instruction. As for math in grades 1-5 the  classroom teacher will provide Integrated ENL instruction. I All ENL classrooms are  very print rich and provide the students with many visuals. Instruction is provided in English as PS 171 offers a Freestanding  ENL Program only at this time.               4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Our ELLs are evaluated in English only. We provide translations of content area assessments to newcomer ELLs only. This  year we will be using MyOn which does have books available in other languages.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     PS171Q does not have any SIFE ELLs at this time.   Newcomer ELLs receive the mandated units of ENL instruction based on their NYSITEL score. Also, newcomers are invited to  the Title III ENL program. In addition , newcomer ELLs in grades 3-5 are assigned to a City Year member that provides  additional support during the day and also focuses on individual instruction in the back of the classroom. During individual  instruction newcomers have the opportunity to work on the basics; alphabet, phonemic awareness, labeling, etc. In grades K-5  newcomers also take advantage of the full version of StarFall purchased by the school. During this time newcomers sit by the  computer with headphones and follow the program's directions. In grades K-2 newcomers receive extra center time. This time  allows for vocabulary building and opening up to the new environment.   Developing ELLs and Long Term ELLs receive the mandated units of ENL instruction. Also, developing ELLs are invited to the  Title III ENL program. In addition, developing students in grades K-2 have additional center time in both math and literacy. In  grades 3-5 both developing and long term ELLs have assigned City Year members that provide small group instruction targeting       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           84      individual needs. Long term ELLs are also placed in RTI groups. During RTI long term ELLs work in small groups. RTI groups are  based on students’ individual needs. Therefore, each group has a different focus.   PS171Q monitors ELLs who have exited the program for two years by continuing to keep track of each students reading level  and state test results. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA and Math. Two years after exiting ELL  status students are placed in general education classrooms  depending on progress made within the former ELL two year  period.  All ELLs receive testing accommodations on all state tests. ELLs receive time and a half during the ELA and Math state tests.  Former ELLs (ELLs who have reached the commanding level on the NYSESLAT) receive time and a half during the ELA and Math  test for two years after achieving the commanding level on the NYSESLAT.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ENL rooms have the following:  a. visuals; in print and promethean board  b. labels in Grades K-5  c. ReadyGen literacy curriculum; ENL teachers on all grade levels enhance the curriculum by providing supportive math,  literacy, and art activities.   d. centers in grades K-2 targeting students individual needs   e. ENL teachers provide on-line access to Pearson so parents can access support lessons.  f. all ELLs including ELLs with an IEP additional resources are used inside the classroom that include but are not limited to:  Pebble Go and Continental's New York ELLs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In grades Kindergarten and the 12:1:1 classrooms, students  are serviced by the ENL teacher on that grade. The ENL teacher  provides Integrated ENL units of study. In addition, to the ENL teacher the ENL Coordinator pushes-in to provide Stand Alone  ENL units of study. ELLs with IEPs are blended with general education ELLs on the same grade level, in an ICT classroom in  grades 1-5. As part of the Stand-Alone ENL units of study the ENL Coordinator works with students individually on areas of  need. As part of the Integrated ENL units of study the ENL Coordinator works closely with the classroom teacher to prepare  lessons that are suitable for ELLs.  Also, flexible programming allows assessing the needs of the student on the spot and  forming differentiated groups based on need during a particular lesson.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS171Q offers the following programs to which all ELLs are invited:  a.     Saturday ENL Academy/After School/Early Bird  All ENL students are invited to the Saturday ENL Academy/After School/Early Bird programs. The  ENL students are grouped  based on proficiency level. During the Saturday program students work on a computer based program called MyOn and  Coach. ELLs that are reading below grade level are invited to the after school guided reading program. ELLs along with non ELLs  are grouped based on reading level.  b.    after school/Saturday/Early Bird math math and ELA enrichment programs meeting twice a week for one hour per session  ELLs and non ELLs who are struggling with math receive an invitation to the math after-school program. During this program  students prepare for the NYS Math test.   c. Guided reading pull–out/push in groups during the school day  Students struggling with content area vocabulary are assigned to guided reading groups based on their Running Records and  results of the MyOn assessment. These groups meet twice a week for a half hour each session. Students build essential       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85      vocabulary needed to read nonfiction books.   All intervention services offered in our school are in English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This coming year we are looking forward to grouping our Saturday ENL Academy ELLs by proficiency levels and not grade level.  Also, this coming year the ENL Coordinator will push-in during Social Studies, Science, and Math. In addition, the ENL  Coordinator will push in to ENL classrooms with dually certified teachers to provide additional support during Stand Alone ENL.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Invitations for all programs are sent home with the student on bright color paper. If spots are not filled another notice will be  sent home with the student. This year we will offer the following (and hopefully more):  1. half year of art  2. half year of music  3 each class receives residencies   4. After school homework help/Jacob Riis  As mentioned above all ELLs are invited to the many programs offered at PS171Q. A high number of ELLs is represented in  each program because it is our ELLs who are struggling with reading, math, and other content area subjects. We try to provide  our ELLs with as much support as we possibly can so that they can make progress.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  PS171Q uses:  a. Starfall / iReady  b. Fountas and Pinnell/ReadyGen Reading Programs  c. Envision  d. Social Studies  e. DOE provided libraries  f. Harcourt Language Arts  g. Scholastic Guided Reading  h. leveled libraries  i. NY ELLs  j. Finish Line ELLs  k. Aspire Science  l. Pebble Go (tech)  m. Guided Reading     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   PS171Q only offers Freestanding ENL at this time. We support the student's home language by providing many books in the  classroom libraries that represent the languages spoken by students in the classrooms. Many of our books provide side by side  translations.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The cognitive ability in addition to the student's ages and grade levels impact the actual time that lessons are presented for,  the number of activities presented within a given time frame and the outcomes expected from each student. We address  these in small groups.  Students are grouped by grade level. When students enter PS171Q they are placed in the appropriate grade based on their       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86         birth date. When we form small groups we make sure that students are less than two years apart.   When we plan services for ELLs and ELL-SWDs we take into consideration not only the grade, age, and level but also their  cognitive needs. We prepare lessons that fully engage students and are hands on.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   New enrolled ELLs are teamed up with a buddy that speaks the same language. This allows for the newly enrolled ELL to feel  comfortable and have the possibility of asking questions in his/her language. Also, newly enrolled ELLs who have achieved a  NYSITEL score below emerging are allocated computer time daily. These students work on the full version of Starfall and  iReady where they learn at their individual levels about the alphabet, letter sounds, and basic vocabulary. Students work  independently on the computer; they follow the programs instructions. In the lower grades newly enrolled ELLs receive extra  center time. This allows the newly enrolled ELLs to learn while playing and socialize with students in their group.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development, at the school level, is provided on Monday afternoons for all staff members. In addition, teachers of  ELLs receive additional professional development on Monday after all other teachers have been dismissed. These meetings are  run by the Assistant Principal, Literacy Coach or ENL Coordinator. Upon returning from an outside meeting, the ENL  Coordinator will turnkey the information.    Professional development received by the ENL Coordinator focusing on supporting ELLs as they engage in the  Learning  Standards is presented in detail to all teachers of ELLs. In the area of literacy, the literacy coach is sure to address the adapted  learning strategies presented by Pearson in workshops and also is providing demonstrations in the classrooms.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87         We address the transition from elementary to middle school by moving the children from single subject notebooks to multiple  subject notebooks and binders. One of our fifth grade teachers is noted as the point person in connecting with our local middle  school IS126. Inter-visitations are organized. An assembly for the children is held here and they also go there to visit. Our  guidance counselor handles all the applications. The guidance counselor does the following: a. provides translation for parents  of ELLs when necessary for parent meetings and workshops, b. arranges for ELLs to be "buddied up" with same language  student in their classes for extra support, c. provides materials in home language for parents, i.e., middle school applications  and gifted and talented applications, d.  provides testing of gifted and talented in home language if requested by parents, e.  provides general support when needed by ELLs to transition socially.  Professional Development sessions will begin in September. Also, based on the school calendar specific dates of professional  development will be provided and both the assistant principal and the ENL Coordinator will make sure they exceed the  required amount of mandated hours. Logs of all Professional Development sessions with teacher signatures will be held on  file.   ENL teachers partake in all PLO opportunities.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents will be invited for an Orientation meeting that will discuss the students’ language development progress, language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas both in October and in May. In October  these findings will be based on the NYSESLAT results and in May findings will be based on students’ progress throughout the  year in both Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL.  These two meetings will be held in the afternoon. Also, parents will be  informed that on any Tuesday they may make an appointment to meet with the teacher to discuss their child’s progress.  Translations for these meetings will be provided by the Parent Coordinator, paraprofessionals, teachers, and City Year  Members. If a translator is not available on site the Translations Unit will be contacted.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of newly incoming ELLs are invited to the mandated parent meeting. During this meeting parents are also informed  about the school and its mission statement.   ELL students are encouraged to attend parent-teacher conferences with their parents as a means of fostering home-school  connections.  Teachers routinely encourage ELL parent participation in trips, holiday celebrations, and class/school performances.   School leaders and teachers routinely provide students and parents with communications (translated as necessary) regarding  school events, curriculum items, and helpful strategies for conversational building.  PTA in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator provide opportunities for ELL parents to engage in the school environment, by  offering opportunities, such as Math Night, PJ’s and a Book Night, and Hoedown (Western Party), for school leaders, parents,  teachers, and support staff to engage within social context.  Many workshops are offered for parents during the day and are posted on the Monthly Calendar. These include; Transitioning  to Kindergarten, Health workshop, Integrating technology into Literacy and Math, and monthly themed workshops.   Weekly ENL Classes for parents will be available for an hour, each session. A needs assessment will be conducted to determine  the needs of the parents.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           88      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Stone, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           90                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS171Q                                                                              School DBN: 30Q171  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   plan to  provide   interpretation   service(s)?       Formal face-to-face meetings take place during parent-teacher  conferences. They are scheduled for September, November, March,  and May. Also, in October parents of ELLs will be invited to a meeting  with the ENL Coordinator to discuss NYSESLAT results and in May to  discuss individual student progress. Also, on Tuesday afternoons  parents may make appointments with the ENL Coordinator and ENL  teachers to discuss their child's progress.       Teachers routinely encourage parent participation in trips, holiday  celebrations, and class/school performances.    School leaders and teachers routinely provide parents with  communication (translated as necessary) regarding school events,  curriculum items, and helpful strategies for conversational building.   PTA in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator provide opportunities  for parents to engage in the school environment, by offering  opportunities, such as Math Night, PJ’s and a Book Night, for school  leaders, parents, teachers, and support staff to engage within social  context.           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.                  Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           94     Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Translation services both written and oral will be provided in-house by school staff. Depending on the parent’s  preferred language a translator will be called. PS171Q has about 8 City Year members usually representing  approximately 3 languages. Also, always available to provide translations are para professionals, teachers and parent  coordinator. If a translator is not available for a specific language the Translations Unit will be contacted.All  notification documents will be printed from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet side and distributed  based on parent's preferred language.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In May a parent survey will be sent home and results of the survey will be closely examined. Also, in May a focus  group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school will be created. This focus group will  meet with the Assistant Principal and Language Access Coordinator to gather feedback on the quality and availability  of services.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           95
