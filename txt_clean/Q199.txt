This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      The teachers, students, parents and staff of P.S. 199Q promise to work together as a TEAM to make our school a  great place to learn and grow.

Current strategies for improving instruction and student performance in English language arts include the  implementation of a balanced literacy uniform curriculum consisting of: reading workshop, independent/partnership   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      reading and writing, read aloud, storytelling, shared reading, guided reading, reading centers, book clubs, writers  workshop, interactive read aloud, word study, Wilson Reading Program, and teacher/student reading and writing  conferences. This approach will be continued in the 2018-2019 school year. Classroom libraries, reduced class sizes,  academic support personnel (paraprofessionals included) in the classroom, and the assignment of two full-time  instructional coaches will further support literacy instruction.   The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project partnership will continue to be implemented in grades K-5. Reading  and writing workshop structures will provide students with strategies that will enable them to become proficient  readers and writers as measured by increased performance and progress in New York State ELA Exam. Student growth  in reading and writing will be assessed on an on-going basis by teachers through reading assessment records, student  and teacher reading and writing conferences and analysis of student writing and publications. Professional  development to support the implementation of the reading and writing curriculum consists of sessions that include  demonstration lessons, study group meetings and professional development workshops. The demonstration lessons  and study group meetings are conducted by a Teachers College Staff Developer. Supervisors and teachers attend  professional development workshops during the school year, participate in year-long Learning Institutes and  participate in Teachers College Summer Institutes on the teaching of reading and writing (see below for a more  detailed description). In addition, instructional coaches attend ongoing literacy coach study groups with a Teachers  College staff developer. English as a Second Language teachers attend English Language Learner calendar days  provided by Teachers College.   Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Professional Development includes:   1. Demonstration Teaching – This site-based professional development includes classroom demonstrations for  reading and writing workshop provided by Teachers College Reading and Writing Project consultants. Cadres of  teachers attend these sessions. Consultants provide direct support to all classroom teachers and instructional  coaches. Supervisors participate in professional development sessions. Study group sessions, offer participants the  opportunity to discuss the course of study which frames the classroom work, review student work and discuss the  plans for the following units of study.   2. Mentoring/Leadership Institutes for Teachers – Teachers College Reading and Writing Project recognizes that  professional development must be capacity building. The Project provides high-level and rigorous instruction to  school teacher-leaders in the form of Leadership Institutes. During the 2015-2016 school year, classroom teachers and  instructional coaches will continue to participate in Study Groups. At these sessions, individuals learn to lead study  groups within the school, and to facilitate professional development within the school building.    3. Professional Development for School Leaders – The Project provides a separate and complementary system of  professional development for school administrators. Each month, principals and assistant principals are invited to a  presentation by a leading researcher, followed by ongoing study groups. These study groups meet to engage in a  continuing study of topics of critical importance to school leaders. The goal of this professional development is to  achieve school-wide integration of scientifically-based practices including curricular reform, adherence to the  common core standards and regular assessment at every level of instruction. The principal of P.S. 199Q participates in  these monthly professional development sessions during the entire school year.   4. Calendar Days: The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project offers professional development “Calendar Days”.  Our teachers attend these all day conferences that focus on specific topics in the area of reading and writing  instruction. Classroom teachers, funded reading teacher, ESL teachers, and Instructional Coaches attend calendar  days throughout the school year. These professional development sessions help support classroom instruction.    5. Institutes – Each summer our teachers and administrators are invited to participate in Teachers College Reading  and Writing Project Summer Institutes. There are four summer institutes each summer. Institutes offer focused  instruction on the teaching of reading and writing. Each day of the institute begins and ends with a keynote address.  During the day, teachers and administrators attend courses on specific topics and small group sessions to help   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      strengthen methods of teaching reading and writing. Administrators attend special sections developed for school  administrators.   School based professional development activities include the use of coaches and AIS teachers to provide model  demonstration lessons and in class support for new teachers (to the profession and to P.S. 199Q) and teachers in  need of assistance. Teachers meet by grade at the beginning of the school year to identify professional development  activities that address the needs of the school community.    P.S. 199Q became a systemic school at the start of the 2001-2002 school year. P.S. 199Q is one of the model sites for  New York City. Other schools in our district, across the city and across the country have sent their teachers and  administrators to P.S. 199Q for classroom intervisitations. These intervisitations have afforded other teachers and  school leaders the opportunity to observe the structures and instructional program for reading and writing  instruction.   Reading instruction is supported by leveled classroom libraries (e.g. Scholastic, Sundance, Book Source, National  Geographic, Rigby, and Wright Group) in all K to 5 classes. Classroom libraries include a variety of fiction and non- fiction novels and tradebooks, in order to enhance students’ literacy experiences and support the instruction in all  content areas. Kindergarten through grade five teachers use Words Their Way as a resource guide.   2015-2016 2016-2017 NYS ELA results provide evidence that the literacy curriculum and the professional  development supporting the teachers are effective.   The 2018-2019 school year is the sixth year of the implementation of Investigations as the primary vehicle for math  instruction in all grades, K-5. The curriculum is designed to engage students in making sense of mathematical ideas  and follows an inquiry approach to instruction. The curriculum is designed to:   Support students to make sense of mathematics and become mathematical thinkers   Focus of computational fluency   Emphasize reasoning   Communicate mathematics content to teachers   Engage the range of learners in understanding mathematics   The curriculum is aligned with the Common Core Standards and includes the 8 math practices. Mathematics  instruction in grades K-2 is scheduled for 60 minutes. Instruction in grades 3-5 is scheduled for 75 minutes. One  instructional coach support the implementation of the Investigations curriculum. Professional development in  mathematics is provided by Metamorphosis which is aligned with the methodology of the Investigations curriculum.  NYS Math results provide evidence that additional professional development is necessary to increase student  achievement.    The New York State Science curriculum is followed throughout all grades. Non-fiction books, and reading and writing  workshops enhance the science curriculum and promote reading in the content area. The FOSS science instructional  program is aligned with the State and City standards. FOSS kits focus on hands-on instruction where students are  given opportunities to use an inquiry-based approach to predict, explore and use scientific thinking processes to  investigate science concepts. Five cluster teachers service all classes in grades K to 5 for one to three 50 minute  periods a week.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      There are five self-contained Special Education classes and seven Integrated Co-Teaching classes. In addition, the  special education programs include Special Education Teacher Support Services, Speech and Language Therapy,  Counseling, Vision Services, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Hearing Education Services.   The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a collaboratively developed plan based on information provided by  parents, assessment professionals, instructional personnel, related service providers and where appropriate, the  student. During annual, requested, re-evaluations, and triennial reviews of a student’s IEP, the IEP Team determines  which services the student needs or no longer requires. The IEP Team must consider the student’s ability to  participate with typically developing peers, to the greatest extent possible; the student’s strengths (in English and in  other than English language for English Language Learners); parents’ concerns for enhancing the student’s education;  the results of the most recent assessments; the student’s language needs if the student is an English Language  Learner; the communication needs of a student and positive behavior strategies for a student. The IEP Team must  also consider the present levels of performance; the need for supplementary aids and services; the extent to which  the student will not participate with non-disabled students in general education classes and the location (in the  general education classroom or a separate location) for Special Education Teacher Support Services and/or Related  Services. Upon review, the IEP Team may recommend the decertification of a student from special education  programs or decertification of a student from special education programs with the provision of appropriate support  services for up to one-year following the student’s declassification. A student who continues to require on-going  special education services for more than a year is not appropriate for declassification services. Declassification  support services are intended to support the decertified student while he/she makes the transition from a special  education program to a general education program with no other special education services. Academic Intervention  Services can be provided to assist with the transition from a special education program to a general education  program with no other special education services. During reorganization of classes special education students will be  clustered appropriately to support the implementation of Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS).   Funded programs assist students who are in need of additional support and help improve student performance. AIS  Reading follows a push-in/co-teaching model. Funded Math program follow a push-in/pull-out model. The ESL  program follows push-in/co-teaching model. Designated paraprofessionals have been trained in the reading  intervention, Reading Rescue.    The AIS Reading Program is a remedial program designed to improve the reading skills of students in grades 1-2 who  are at risk of not meeting grade benchmarks and/or state performance standards. The AIS Reading Program is a  literacy instructional model that provides students in grades 1 to 2 with targeted instruction in reading and writing.  The literacy program is designed to assist students with attaining reading growth in their respective grade levels.    The Parent Coordinator implements a variety of strategies to involve parents in the education of their children. The  Parent Coordinator conducts a structured parent involvement program that attracts and maintains a high level of  parent participation. Workshops are scheduled twice a month based on topics that address the needs and/or  interests of parents as determined by feedback from evaluations and surveys. The Parent Coordinator develops a  monthly Parent Newsletter and a monthly calendar to keep parents informed of school activities and events.  Workshops will be conducted at the main building and both annex buildings.    The English as a Second Language Program is conducted by five ESL teachers. English language learners in  kindergarten through fifth grade receive instruction utilizing ESL approaches and methods based on NYS ESL Learning  Standards. The instruction prepares students to participate in the English language literacy activities conducted by the  classroom teacher. Classes are organized with a concentration of English language learners. ESL teachers push-into  classes for a total of at least 360 minutes or 180 minutes depending on the language proficiency of English language  learners in the class.   P.S. 199Q participates in the Arts. P.S. 199Q has developed partnerships and collaborations with many cultural  organizations. These partnerships provide direct instructional services to students in art, music, dance and theatre.  During the 2018-2019 school year, a partnership for music (**pending funding**) has been developed with Creative  Music (Mr. Ayanda Clark). Creative Music services one Grade 3 class, one Grade 2 class, two Grade 1 classes and seven   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Kindergarten classes. New York City Ballet and New York Children’s Theater (formerly known as Making Books Sing)  are the arts partners for drama, dance and music. New York City Ballet services five Grade 5 classes, six Grade 4  classes, four Grade 3 classes, six Grade 2 classes and two Grade 1 classes. New York Children’s Theater (formerly  known as Making Books Sing) services three Grade 5 class, two Grade 4 classes, three Grade 3 classes, one Grade 2  class and three Grade 1 classes. Many classes at P.S. 199Q are engaged with at least one arts partners. We will be  developing additional partnerships with other cultural arts institutions (**pending funding**). Councilman Jimmy Van  Bramer provides funding for an arts partnership through Queens Theater in the Park. One P.S. 199Q teacher works  side by side with a theater coach to support students in developing, writing, choreographing and performing a play.  The play is performed in front of a live audience at Queens Theater in the Park in June 2016.    Sunnyside Community Services, a community-based organization implements an after-school program to support  literacy at P.S. 199Q. The program services 225 students from kindergarten (Little Stars) through fifth grade. It is  conducted Monday through Friday from 2:35 PM to 5:30 PM. Children receive assistance with homework and have  the opportunity to participate in courses and clubs during the week. The courses offered include: art,  dance/movement, photography and gym. To involve parents, the after school program offers parent workshops at  P.S. 199Q. Throughout the year, parents have the opportunity to attend after school program performances that  include holiday presentations, multicultural festivals, trips, and end of year celebrations.    The Tibetan Language School of New York and New Jersey, a community-based organization, provides instruction to  the Tibetan community. the program provides services to students in Kindergarten to Grade 12.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Below is the transition plan to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary school  program:   1. Special education students and parents were invited in August 2018 for a tour of the school. Students and parents  will meet their teacher, principal, assistant principals and other related service providers. Parents will have an  opportunity to complete a survey of their child with the support of staff members.   2. In January 2018 letters will be hand delivered to several local preschools to be distributed to their students. The  letters explain the registration process as well as providing the dates.   3. Parents will have an opportunity to visit P.S. 199Q from January to September to make an appointment, provide  the required documents (proof of address and proof of birth) and pick up forms to be returned at the appointment  provided to them.   4. From February to May parents will return for their appointments with their children and the completed forms.  During this appointment parents and children will be interviewed by our language specialist, Mrs. Mc Loughlin and  language and ethnicity forms were completed as well as viewing a film outlining ESL services offered by DOE schools.  Although the DOE included a deadline, P.S. 199Q continued to welcome and register parents.    5. In April letters will be sent to incoming Kindergarten parents offering them placement in September. Parents will  complete the placement form attached to the bottom of the letter and specify whether they reject or accept our  offer.   6. In June 2018 we hosted a Kindergarten orientation at which time parents will be given a tour of the Kindergarten  annex building. Parents will be provided information about our Kindergarten instructional program and the principal  will respond to any questions or concerns.   7. In July letters were sent to all upcoming Kindergarten students advising them of their class assignment.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65     4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) – A team composed of teachers and administration reflected on the options  for measuring student learning. Following professional development (school, summer MOSL workshop) the team  worked together and selected the assessments which were approved by the principal. The MoSL options and their  impact were explained to the staff in September, 2016 during professional development sessions. Further discussion  occurred during the Initial Planning Conferences in September and October 2016. The team will meet in December  2016 to discuss modifications to the MoSL selections. In particular:   1. The MoSL team discussed how the “50% rule” impacts teachers with multiple grade/subject assignments.    2. The MoSL team discussed how 10 or more English Language Learners will impact the rating of K to 2 teachers.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   489,952.00     283,353.00     47,856.00    0     5,148,330.00                                     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Inzerillo, Principal    Margaret Morrison, Assistant Principal Mary Dentrone, Assistant Principal    “A Place Where Excellence in Education and Values Go Hand in Hand”    Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 199, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through  school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents,  and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.         Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   1. providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of Dreambox;   2. providing parents with the information and knowldege needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;   3. fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   4. providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   5. sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   6. providing professional development opportunities for school staff to improve outreach, communication skills and  cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of our school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:   1. actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title  I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   2. engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   3. ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement workshops as described in  our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   4. support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      5. maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

Reading and writing workshop structures will provide ELL students  with strategies that will enable them to become proficient readers and writers as measured by  increased scores in city and state language arts assessments.  Student growth in reading and  writing will be assessed on an on-going basis by teachers through reading assessment, student  and teacher reading and writing conferences and analysis of student writing and  publications.  Professional development to support the implementation of the reading and writing  curriculum consists of sessions that include demonstration lessons, study group meetings and  workshops.  The demonstration lessons and study group meetings are conducted by a Teachers  College consultant.  Supervisors and teachers attend professional development workshops during  the school year (approximately 12 sessions), and participate in Teachers College Summer  Institutes on the teaching of reading and writing. In addition, Instructional coaches attend  ongoing literacy coach study groups with a Teachers College staff developer.    Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Professional Development includes:    •             Demonstration Teaching – This site-based professional development includes classroom  demonstrations for reading and writing workshops provided by Teachers College Reading and  Writing Project consultants. Cadres of teachers attend these sessions. Consultants provide direct  support to all ENL classroom teachers and instructional support staff (Instructional coaches,  ENL push-in teachers, and AIS reading teachers). Supervisors participate in professional  development sessions.  The consultants follow a gradual release of responsibility, which allows  teachers to assume more responsibility for the instruction, which occurs during the classroom- based professional development.  •             Calendar Days:  The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project offers professional  development “Calendar Days."  Our teachers attend these all-day conferences that focus on  specific topics in the area of reading and writing instruction.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Paste response to question here:    1. Describe what assessment tool your school uses to assess the early literacy skills of your ELLs (e.g., Mosl, E Class, TCRWP).  What insights do the data provide about your ELLs?  How can this information help inform your school’s instructional  plan?  Please provide any quantitative data available to support your response.       Assessment tools used to assess early literacy skills of ELLs include MOSL, ECLAS Variation - Pre Assessments for Reading;  ELA/Math Pre/Post Performance Assessment Task; TCRWP Narriative Continuum, Opinion Continuum and Opinion  Continuum,; NYSITELL; running records; Math Periodic Assessments (Grades 3 to 5 only); Heinemann Books online (Pre and  Post Assessments); On-Demand writing pieces before and after each genre; I-Ready Diagnostic Testing in order to individualize  instruction for each ELL student.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85      We use formal assessments as well as informal assessments such as checklists, conference notes and rubrics for eeach unit of  study to accurately evaluate our Ells' progress.    This information gathered from the above assessments has informed our school’s instructional plan as follows:     •     Additional pre-writing strategies in writing workshop such as thinking maps, visualization structures, and writing  inventories will be part of our plan.     •     ENL teachers will provide language support during content area instruction in an effort to build academic vocabulary (tier 2  and tier 3 words).  •     Extended Day After School Program for ELLs in Grades 1 to 4  with a strong focus on literacy and math will be provided.  •     Saturday Morning Program for ELLs in Grades 3 and 4 with a strong focus on non-narrative reading, writing and math will  be provided.  •     Sunnyside After School Program has enhanced their Parent ENL/Literacy component to provide English language support  to parents of ELLs.  •     Teachers will receive additional Professional Development in math, reading and writing. Instructional coaches, Teachers  College Staff Developers and Mrs. Lee in-house math staff developer will support our teachers. Our coaches will focus their  support on enhancing math, reading and  writing for ELLs.    •               Mrs. Lee in- house  math staff developer will provide additional support to teachers in applying Danielson Best  Practices and CCSS in the areas of math.   •     Instructional coaches will focus support on increasing academic language in the content area of science and social studies  with content area teachers.     Professional Learning Communities will focus on math, reading and writing and utilizing the New York State Common Core  Learning Standards as our planning guide for effective instruction.  Teachers of both standalone and integrated models will  participate in Professional Learning Communities focusing on supporting ELLs as they study the following:          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Students participate in an instructional program that regularly ensures continuity of rigorous instruction. They participate in a  program that is aligned with mandated ENL and content learning standards and the curriculum. Students are grouped for  targeted areas of instruction according to the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.     We have an instructional program that focuses on the development of the English language: reading, writing as well as oral  communication. Teachers scaffold academic language to support students. Teachers model the use of academic language in  ways which students are expected to respond and participate.  Instructional materials include a wide range of print, visual and  digital resources designed for increasing English language proficiency.    Current strategies for improving instructional planning and performance for ELLs in English language arts include the  implementation of a balanced literacy uniform curriculum consisting of: reading workshop, independent/partnership reading  and writing, read aloud, storytelling, shared reading, guided reading, reading centers, book clubs, writers workshop,  interactive read aloud, word study, Wilson Reading Program, and teacher/student reading and writing  conferences.   Classroom libraries, reduced class sizes, academic support personnel (paraprofessionals included) in the  classroom, and the assignment of two full-time instructional coaches will further support literacy instruction.  In math, ELLs are  supported through the implementation of Investigations as the primary vehicle for math instruction in all grades, K-5.  The  curriculum is designed to engage ELL  students in making sense of mathematical ideas and follows an inquiry approach to  instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86      We rely on the NYSESLAT results to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs.  NYSESLAT scores provide us with  information across all grades and across modalities (reading, writing, listening and speaking).  NYSESLAT scores guide us in the  development of professional development and the development of support programs for ELLs.  NYSESLAT results helps us  identify areas of need so that we can plan and best support our ELL students.  For example, according to P.S. 199Q's ELL Data  Analysis Tool, our NYSESLAT results indicate that 17 ELL students regressed 1 proficiency level and in addition, on the  NYSESLAT, 103 of our ELLs remained at the same proficiency level.  Making progress for these identified students is an area of  need.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    P.S. 199 will put in place a reading intervention program for our lowest performing students. It is designed to build reading  success through an intensive, structured, and spiraling curriculum that incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, spelling,  vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency. Systematic, sequentially structured lessons ensure mastery of concepts and allow for  easy implementation. Auditory, visual, and kinesthetic activities keep students actively engaged. Data-driven instruction with  continual practice and review ensure measurable and permanent gains.  AIS services are provided to assist ELL students in  acquiring proficiency in the four communication skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) necessary for basic  interpersonal communication and acquiring cognitive academic proficiency. Language and content instruction is integrated  simultaneously and systematically. Standalone and integrated ENL teachers incorporate a variety of reading and writing  activities to reflect state and citywide reading and content area assessments. This includes developing prewriting, note taking  and essay writing strategies. Teachers support ELL students in literacy through a variety of instructional strategies, such as read  aloud, guided reading, readers’ theatre, small group work, etc.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S 199 uses school data gathered from the number of years of instruction in a English as a new language program, results on  the annual English language proficiency assessment exam (NYSESLAT), results from the NYSITELL, assessment of the needs of  ELL students via classwork, class assessments, teacher feedback, etc.  Based on the results of this data, PS 199 implements an  effective RTI model for all students, including ELLs,that consists of an Extended Day program and small group instruction  throughout the school day (AIS).  P.S. 199 provides targeted interventions (small group, provide students with additional  instructional time and/or utilization of techniques with more intensive focus) to students who are experiencing challenges  with learning or who are struggling to make progress on certain skills or concepts. Students are identified at the beginning of  the year based on TC Running Records. Tier 2 interventions include Fundations for lower grades and Wilson for the upper  grades provided during AM Program by the literacy specialist (AIS teacher). Parents are notified when a child begins to receive  RTI intervention. Teachers monitor the child's progress and change strategies if necessary using assessments to determine the  child's needs.  Throughout all tiers of RTI, P.S. 199 assesses students to identify needs and check student progress.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      2. What is revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels (on the LAB-R and NYSESLAT) and grades?     The data patterns on the NYSESLAT show that as a school:  Grade Level Data:  Kindergarten ELL Students:  First Grade ELL Students:  Second Grade Students:  Third Grade Students:    Fourth Grade Students:  Fifth Grade Students:  The data patterns indicate that the largest number of our ELL students are at Transitioning or Expanding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87         proficiency levels.  Our next largest group is at the Commanding proficiency level.  The data also shows that we have a  combined 15% of our students who are Entering and Emerging proficiency levels and need the most support (360 minutes of  ENL support services).  The data also shows that most of our Entering proficiency level students are in kindergarten and first  grade (17 students) while there are only 6 students from third through fifth grade who are at the Entering level of proficiency.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the start of the school year, the principal disseminates data from previous year's NYSESLAT results with teachers.   ENL  teachers and classroom teachers across grades consult and discuss  students’ strengths and weaknesses using these results,  NYSITELL results, and results from student work to plan accordingly. ENL teachers and classroom teachers discuss student  results on the NYSESLAT as it relates to student performance on the four modalities: reading, writing, listening and speaking so  that adjustments can be made to each student's instructional program that best meets his or her individual needs. Throughout  the school year, teachers and administrators meet on an ongoing basis to share and review data. and the progress of ELL  students. We plan for the common core and reflect on our strengths and growth areas. ENL teacher teams collect student  work and analyze it to determine areas of growth and areas were there are needs.  ENL Teacher Teams  make  recommendations for their instructional program based on these areas of growth and needs.  Findings are communicated with  classroom teachers. ENL Teacher Teams also conduct research on topics related to ELL and the CCLS  during time on Mondays  dedicated for professional development.  ENL teachers meet in inquiry groups to conduct this research and  develop meaningful strategies that will best support our ELL students. ENL Teachers identify strategies and embed them into  instructional plans. Classroom teachers are also given instruction on how to include language objectives into classroom  curriculum.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL instruction is delivered in an integrated ENL model or standalone ENL classes. Students within these classes are  grouped according to their ENL levels.  Students who are Entering and Emerging ENL levels are grouped together so  that they can receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction.  Students who are Transitional and Expanding are grouped  together so that they can receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  Students who are Commanding receive 90  minutes  of ENL instruction.  ENL services within an integrated ENL class are provided ENL instruction in a co-teaching  model during reading workshop, writing workshop, shared reading, word work, read aloud, or a concentration in the  content area of science and social studies using ENL methodology and/or technology. In addition to the co-teaching  model. In the standalone ENL classes, ENL methodology and supports are provided throughout the instructional day.  The ENL teachers  provide  small group targeted instruction. ELL students are grouped heterogeneously in each class.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A         c.  DL program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Five ENL teachers provide instruction, utilizing ENL approaches and methods based on NYS ENL Standards and NYS Common  Core Standards.  Classes are organized with a concentration of English Language Learners at similar proficiency levels.  Schedules are established to ensure ENL teachers push into classes for a total of at least 360 minutes (Entering and Emerging  level) or 180 minutes (Transitioning and Expanding level) per week period. Commanding former ELLs will receive an additional  90 minutes a week for the next 2 years. Certain ENL providers are designated to specific grades and classes.  ENL services  within an integrated ENL class are provided ENL instruction in a co-teaching model during reading workshop, writing  workshop, shared reading, word work, read aloud, or a concentration in the content area of science and social studies using  ENL methodology and/or technology in order to provide either the mandated 360 minutes or mandated 180 minutes of ENL  support services, depending on each student proficiency levels.  ELL students in standalone ENL classes also receive ENL  supports during all ELA balanced literacy structures (reading workshop, writing workshop, shared reading, shared writing,  interactive writing, word work, read aloud).        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In both standalone and integrated ENL models, ENL  teacher(s) make use of varied instructional approaches to enrich language  development in all core content instructional areas. (English language Arts, math science, or social studies).  For both models,  manipulatives are used on a regular basis. In addition, in both ENL models, Total Physical Response is emphasized in the lower  grades.  The use of technology, audiovisual equipment, and hands-on learning is encouraged in all ENL classes.  Students do  projects and research-based thematic units in content areas, which stress all four modalities of the ENL classroom (listening,  speaking, reading, and writing).  The content areas are taught in ENL classrooms with an emphasis placed on grammar,  academic language, specialized vocabulary, and comprehension of fiction and nonfiction texts.ENL teachers pull groups of  students depending on their needs.  TPR, visuals, modeling answers, manipulatives, prompts/models, Thinking Maps, are some  of the supports utilized.  In addition, vocabulary experience using lexical arrays, deconstruct/reconstruct "juicy" complex  sentences, word play, introduction of Tier 2 and Tier 3 words via read aloud, oral repetition in shared reading are employed.  ENL students are taught math, social studies and science using ENL strategies as described above to enhance their learning and  meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Students in both standalone and integrated ENL models are  taught in small strategy groups within the classroom to foster their language development. In the integrated model, ENL  supports are provided that best meet the needs of students.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    Bilingual specialist conducts the LAB-R Spanish during the LAB-R administration for Spanish-speaking eligible students.  Multiple assessments, e.g., student portfolios, state standardized tests (NYSESLAT/LAB-R) informal assessments, (running  records, conference notes), are used to drive content area instruction as well as language development.        5.

In the past, we have found that students are not functioning on grade level in their native  language.  In the event we receive any other SIFE students,  the bilingual specialist will provide additional academic support  services (tutoring services and individualized instruction) if his/her native language is Spanish in groups of up to four students  using an integrated ENL model approach.     b.Instruction for Newcomer ELLs is differentiated for all content area instruction (English language arts, Math, Science and  Social Studies).  ENL lessons and instructional activities encompass curriculum areas and stimulate language development,  curiosity, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the growth of positive concepts about oneself and others for our  Newcomer ELLs.  Teaching strategies for Newcomers includes TPR (Total Physical Response), language experience approach,  and integrated language arts. All these strategies are differentiated to help support the Newcomer ELLs.     c. Developing ELLs are our ELL students who have received English as a new language instruction for a total of four to six  enrolled school years in the NYCDOE school system.  Our Developing ELL students are found in our third, fourth and fifth grade  classrooms.  Our Developing ELL students  will be targeted for academic intervention through differentiated scaffolded  instruction and small group instruction with an emphasis on building academic language.       d. Since we are a Pre-K to 5 school, there are some students who have been in a NYCDOE school for six or more years.   These  students are our Long Term ELLs.  The Long Term ELLs are in our fifth grade classrooms.  They can be found in standalone ENL  classes and integrated ENL classes.  The ENL teachers differentiate instruction for these students across content area  instruction.  These teachers focus their supports on further developing the specific individual needs of each Long Term  ELL.  This includes focusing on small group instruction, one to one instruction, and providing academic intervention support  services as needed.      e. Former ELLs are placed in classrooms with an ELL concentration so that they still get the support from the push-in ENL  teacher when needed.  Differentiated instruction is offered to our Former ELLs through their participation in the AM Program,  Extended Day/After School Program and Saturday Program for academic support. Former ELLs are provided instruction that  meets their individual needs throughout the school day, across all content area instruction.  Former ELLs in grades 3, 4 and 5  will continue to receive ELL testing accommodations. In addition former ELLs will receive 90 minutes a week for the next 2  years.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The needs of newly identified students with disabilities are addressed in the general education classroom and or special  education classrooms (Integrated Co-Teaching or Self Contained Special Education Classrooms - 12:1:1) as specified on each  student's Individualized Education Programs (IEP).  ELL students with disabilities receive instructional supports and  remediation through instructional modifications and differentiation of instruction across all content areas that best meets each  student's individualized needs.  ELLs with disabilities are placed in either a standalone or integrated ENL model.  Examples of  the supports for ELLs with disabilities includes AIS Reading,  and extended-day programs. Reading instruction is supported by  leveled classroom libraries (e.g. Scholastic, Sundance, Book Source, National Geographic, Rigby, and Wright Group) in all K-5  classrooms that contain ELL students who also are students with disabilities. Classroom libraries include a variety of fiction and  non-fiction novels and tradebooks.  In order to support ELLs with disabilities, teachers use Words Their Way as a resource  guide. Math instruction for ELLs who are also students with disabilities supports these students in meeting CCLS by focusing on  8 mathematical practices.  The FOSS science program is used to support science instruction.  ELLs who are also students with  disabilites (SWDs) are not exempt from the NYSESLAT.  These students who have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) amy  use the test modifications and accommodations as indicated on their IEP when they take the NYSESLAT.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90      .Newly identified students with disabilities may also be considered for at-risk speech and language, and at-risk individualized or  group counseling, as deemed necessary.  Students with disabilities receive all services they are mandated to receive, as  indicated on their Individual Educational Plan. When possible, the ENL Coordinator provides additional academic support  services (tutoring services and individualized instruction) to students who did not reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas include:     •     Extended Day PM Programs-This program targets ELLs in reading and math below grade appropriate benchmarks.  The  Extended Day PM Program supports ELL students at Entering, Emerging, Transitional, Expanding and Commanding  levels.  These students are involved in reading, writing, and math extended day programs, Journalism Club, Chess, Math and  Robotics.  Our Extended Day Program includes support for third grade ELL students in reading and math; support for fourth  grade ELL students in reading and math; support for fifth grade ELL students in reading and math.  We also have a Fourth  Grade Math Club that helps support our ELL students.  The Robotics program includes third and fourth grade students and  another section of Robotics for fourth and fifth grade students.   •     Saturday Program- This program targets ELLs in reading, science and math below grade appropriate  benchmarks.  The Saturday Program supports ELL students at Entering, Emerging, Transitional, Expanding and Commanding  levels. The Saturday Program consist of support in reading, writing and math as well as a Robotics program.  Our Saturday  Program includes support for third grade ELL students in reading and math; support for fourth grade ELL students in reading  and math; support for fifth grade ELL students in reading and math.  The Robotics program supports ELLs in fourth and fifth  grades.  •     AIS Teachers provide literacy support for ELLs who are at Entering, Emerging, Transitional, Expanding and Commanding  levels via small group work in literacy and mathematics.             9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data, trends and feedback from teachers, it was felt that students would benefit from an extended day program that  had a strong focus in math.  In response to this feedback, we are created a Fourth Grade Math Club as a new program for the  2017-2018 school year.      More intense professional development will be provided for classroom teachers and ENL teachers in the area of language  development and more effective teaching strategies (e.g. thinking maps, building tier 2 words, "juicy" complex  sentences). We  have a new ENL integrated teacher who will benefit  from professional development in thinking maps, building tier 2 words,  academic vocabulary, providing supports for ELL students across all proficiency levels, etc.   In addition, we will increase ENL  services in the content area of science, social studies, math and technology.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs or services for ELLs were discontinued.           11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  After school extended day programs and Saturday programs include all students (ELLs, special education, general education,  etc.). This includes our extended day programs: reading, writing, and math extended day programs, Journalism Club, Chess,  Math and Robotics.  It also includes  our Saturday programs focusing on reading, writing and math as well as our Robotics  program.  P.S. 199 has students across all five ELL proficiency levels Entering, (Emerging, Transitional, Expanding and  Commanding).  Students in our Extended Day and Saturday programs have ELL representation across all five ELL proficiency   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91      levels.   Written notification is provided for all school programs and the parent notices are provided in various languages.            12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Visual aids, technology aids such as SMART Boards, (in our main building in every classroom) and Promethean Boards (at our  Kindergarten through Second Grade Annex located at St. Raphael's in every classroom),  26 computer carts containing  laptops,  charts, CDs, videos, document cameras, computer programs (Powerpoint) and digital transparencies are incorporated into the  instructional day.  Reading instruction is supported by leveled classroom libraries (e.g. Scholastic, Sundance, Booksource,  National Geographic, Rigby and Wright Group) in all K-5 classes.  Classroom libraries include a variety of fiction and non-fiction  novels and tradebooks, in order to enhance students' literacy experiences and support the instruction in all content  areas. Kindergarten through grade 5 teachers use Words Their Way as a resource guide.   Math manipulatives support our  Investigations program and science materials support our FOSS Science program.   They reinforce student learning through the  different modalities: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic and tactile.  These methods increase background knowledge, auditory  perception, reading ability, decoding and comprehension.  Students in all five ELL proficiency levels have equal access to all  school resources and materials as applicable to meet each student's individual needs.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   P.S. 199 has an ENL Program.  Home language is supported in our  programs. In the ENL program students are given books in  their native language for support as they are learning English. The bilingual coordinator provides books that are in both English  and in the student's home language.  These books can be taken home so that student's can read them with family  members.  This helps students and families have conversations in their home language while also being exposed to English.  In  addition, school memos and letters are translated so that families have access to important information about school activities  and/or important messages.  At parent workshops, translators are available to translate the information shared.  Our parent  coordinator sends out letters to our parent community to canvass interest in topics and assess what our parents need and  most want with regard to support and future parent workshops.  Our bilingual coordinator meets with parents on a regular  basis and is available to further support the needs of families of our ELL students.  This is a very important link between our  school and the families of our ELLs.                                                            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92      Support services and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels as evidenced by the explanation of programs and  services mentioned above.  P.S. 199 ensures that required services and resources support our ELLs' ages and grade levels.  Every effort is made to provide every ELL student with the necessary age and level appropriate high-interest materials, books  and supplies to spark their interest.           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Tutorial services and individualized instruction are offered to newly arrived students in groups of up to four students in either a  standalone or integrated model (pending funding).  Newly enrolled ELL students are entitled to attend the Summer Success  Program before the beginning of the school year (pending funding).  Community Based Organizations (Sunnyside) offer  programs for our kindergarten through grade 5 students.  These include recreational activities and educational trips for newly  enrolled ELL students.  The courses our Community Based Organization - Sunnyside offers includes art, dance/movement,  photography and gym. Children receive assistance with homework and have the opportunity to participate in courses and  clubs during the week.   To involve parents, the Sunnyside after school program offers parent workshops at P.S. 199Q.  Throughout the year, parents have the opportunity to attend after school program performances that include holiday  presentations, multicultural festivals, trips, and end of year celebrations.  The Tibetan Language School of New York and New  Jersey, a community-based organization, provides instruction to the Tibetan community. The program provides services to  students in Kindergarten to Grade 12. The program takes place on Sundays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.     Newly enrolled ELL students participate in our arts residencies.  These include New York City Ballet, African Drumming and  New York City Children's Theater.  The partnership with New York City Ballet provides the opportunity for our ELL students to  go to Lincoln Center to see The Nutcracker and other ballet performances.  Teaching artists provide residencies to each class in  our school.    The school counselor and parent coordinator, along with all members of our school community, participates in our values  based Reaching Out Program.  Our Reaching Out Program guides our newly enrolled ELLs in decision-making. School-wide  literacy activities including "Book of the Month” highlight specific values on a monthly basis and support the implementation  of a uniform and consistent Reaching Out Program. Each month a different value is highlighted. These values include honesty,  perseverance, responsibility, peace, caring and sharing, love, etc. A school-wide culminating activity at the end of the school  year affords the opportunity to embrace all the values in a special Reaching Out Day celebration.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    P.S. 199Q does not offer language electives to students.            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic    developing  Common Core Units of Study and the City-wide Instructional Expectations    facilitating math teacher teams    planning effective math lessons   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  P.S. 199 has a professional development committee 5 members selected by principal, 5 members selected by UFT  representative) that meets throughout the school year.  This committee supports our professional learning communities which  includes all teachers of ELL students.  This committee supports the professional learning committees within their chosen area  of focus by providing articles, feedback, Learning Opportunity videos, Align Teachers College support, Metamorphosis Support  and coach support with the specific focus of the professional learning communities.    Consultants (such as Teacher’s College and Metamorphosis) provide professional development to the teachers of ELLs  (teachers of both standalone and integrated programs). Two instructional coaches will provide support to teachers of ELLs to  our school. Our new ENL teacher is being mentored by both an instructional coach and a ENL teacher throughout the 2017- 2018 school year.  Paraprofessionals in classes of ELL students are also provided professional development in ELA, math and  behavior strategies.       Mrs. Lee supports ENL teachers in implementing the Common Core Standards in math.  In addition, they provide support to  teachers in the following areas:                       All teachers of ELLs on each grade attend  professional development sessions throughout the school year.  This professional  development is designed specifically to help teachers meet the demands of the Common Core State Standards.  The  workshops are hands-on and teachers explore mathematical big ideas, strategies, and models in the number strand.    The  teachers  work with, cross-grade level teams in the following areas:  •         analyze and enrich lessons in existing curricula materials;  •         use mini-lessons to develop students’ mathematical reasoning and communication;  •         assess student oral and written communications;  •         use specific teaching strategies to develop students’ ability to communicate their mathematical reasoning both orally  and in writing;  and  •         use key pedagogical practices to help students meet the new, rigorous expectations in the Common Core state  Standards.   *        reflecting on best  practices in teaching methodologies.    Professional development opportunities will be offered through TC summer professional development, faculty conferences,  grade conferences, school-based and Field Support Centers' professional development sessions, etc. Ongoing professional  development opportunities  will include workshops on ENL methodologies and strategies to support English language learners;  evaluation of student performance data; use of performance data to drive instruction, classroom management for new  teachers, etc.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    P.S. 199Q meets the professional development requirements as per CR 154.2 (15% of total hours for all teachers) .The testing  coordinator, instructional coaches, as well as the ELL specialist, hold on going professional development for the staff on  specific professional development for all teachers that supports our ENL program and meets the needs of our ELL  students.  Professional development for all teachers  includes workshops and ongoing professional development on testing  procedures for ELL students,  testing modifications for ELLs, data analysis, promotional exemptions, etc. The ELL Specialist will  train the staff on the implementation of CR Part 154.  Teachers have received ongoing professional development on the  implementation of Thinking Maps into their curriculum. Thinking Maps has proven to be a beneficial tool for our ELL students  as it is a graphic organizational and visual tool.     Thus far this school year (2017-2018) teachers have received professional development on student autonomy.  Achieving  student autonomy is a focus for our school this school year.  Teachers studied how to support student autonomy for ELLs in  P.S. 199 classrooms.  Professional leaning communities are working together to focus on the following topics that relate to  supporting ELL students:  In each Professional Learning Community, teachers and paraprofessionals develop agendas for each Monday that the  Professional Learning Community meets and each Professional Learning Community maintains a notebook to record their  professional learning.    The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project offers professional development “Calendar Days”. Our teachers attend these  all day conferences that focus on specific topics in the area of reading and writing instruction. Classroom teachers, funded  reading teacher, ESL teachers, and Instructional Coaches attend calendar days throughout the school year. These professional  development sessions help support classroom instruction for all students including our ELLs.    The Principal and Assistant Principals review course offerings/professional development opportunities that are offered by The  Division of English Language Learners.  As appropriate, teachers are selected to attend these professional development  opportunities.    Nonpedagogical staff are provided professional development as well.  Our parent coordinator receives support on how to best  help the parents of our English Language Learners.  In addition our school aides receive guidance from administrators and from  the bilingual specialist on how they can communicate best with students who have limited English language skills.    Documentation for P.S. 199's Professional Development workshops (both in our school building and workshops that teachers  attend outside our school building) is maintained by Mrs. Joyce Guidice, Secretary.  Mrs. Guidice collects agendas and  attendance sheets.  In addition, Mrs. Guidice also collects the documentation from teachers if they attend a professional  development (proof that a teacher is signed up for a workshop, agendas, etc).         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school meets with parents at least one a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations,, to  discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's proficiency assessment results, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          95            language development needs in all content areas. The meetings are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the  language of communication the parent best understands.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   In order to get parents involved with PS199Q as well as with their child’s individual educational experience,  the parent  coordinator Stacey Becco,  has set up various informational and interactive workshops based on the needs and requests of the  parents.       Various interactive workshops have been scheduled such as:  i Ready,  Creating School Accounts, Dial-A-Teacher Support,  Middle School Applications, Western Queens Counseling Services, Child Abuse Prevention, How to Discipline Your Child,  Childhood  Obesity, Information About Asthma, Family Craft (during school hours ,  and/or at night), Family Math Night, Family  Nutrition Night, How Can I Help My Child in Math,  Mathematics Common Core State Standards, Dental Care and What You  Will Need to Know About Diabetes,.  These workshops enhance communication between  parents and their children, as well as  actively involve parents in our school community.       The ENL Coordinator and Parent Coordinator teach adult ENL classes for parents to strengthen their English skills.  Translation services are available for parents who speak a  language other than English.  Services include: staff members  translating information in the parents' native language, calling the Translation Unit  (718-752-7373) and asking them to  translate, or paying an outside vendor to translate.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anthony Inzerillo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          97                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 199Q Maurice A.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 199Q is committed to providing students with the maximum opportunity to learn and achieve academic  success. P.S. 199Q realizes the importance of engaging parents to become involved in promoting their child’s  academic success. To foster a positive rapport with parents, it is essential that effective communication transpire  between our school and parents.  Data from our Home Language Report (RHLA) was used to determine our school’s written translation and oral  interpretation needs.   All school notices sent home to parents are translated into Spanish. All staff members have received professional  development on utilizing the Translation and Interpretation Unit.   School notices sent to parents provide information about: their child’s progress, how parents can support and  improve their child’s academic achievement, parent workshops to learn English, parent workshops that provide  information with regard to testing and curricula, and events taking place in our school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          99      Parent notices provide parents with invaluable information and encourage parental involvement. Translating  notices will ensure that our parents will have the opportunity to participate in shared parent-school  accountability.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Data from our Home Language Report  indicates that we currently have a  population of 891 students who speak  32 different languages. Approximately  33% of our students are English  Language Learners. Approximately 45%  of our student population speak Spanish  at home, 11% speak Bengali and 5.82%  speak Nepali                       3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Documents are submitted to Peggy  Kolokouris in the main office.  Principal Inzerillo reads and approves  each Newsletter. Ms. Kolokouris then  emails the letter to the translation  unit for translation. There are times  when we do not receive the  newsletter back from the translation  unit in a timely fashion. In these  cases, we email the document to  Gema McLoughlin, our ESL  Coordinator, for translation   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          100     invitations for parents to attend  workshops that teach parents how to  help improve their child’s academic  achievement and workshops that  teach English. Each grade  (Kindergarten to five) sends parents a  monthly newsletter that details the  curricula being taught and gives  parents suggestions on how as to help  their child achieve success. These  translated newsletters will provide  parents with specific ways to help  them support their child’s  achievement. Translated notices and  documents will encourage our non- English speaking parents to feel  involved in their child’s education and  they will become more active in the  parent-school shared accountability.
