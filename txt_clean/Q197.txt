Background  Rise Schools have demonstrated:   ●   ●   they have the will and conditions in place to accelerate student growth and meet school improvement  benchmarks.  they have the capacity to lead/implement a school improvement strategy.   Rise Schools have seen some gains1 across multiple measures including graduation rates, college readiness, state  test scores and attendance. As a result, these schools will fully transition out of the Renewal Schools program at  the end of the 2017-2018 SY and continue under the guidance of the Office of Field Support, in partnership with  the Office of School Support and Supervision.    1All Rise Schools met at least 67% of their benchmarks, are not on the State’s Priority list, and have demonstrated a  sustainable school improvement structure that will allow them to build on their progress.    Six Rise Keys for Continued Improvement         1.  Strengthen the Instructional Core   2.  Strengthen Instructional Leadership Capacity   3.  4.  Apply a tiered approach to student intervention  5.  Promote a positive, inclusive school environment for students, staff, parents and   Improve Data Driven Practices   community partners  Increase monitoring and accountability   6.     Theory of Action  If the NYC Department of Education provides customized supports to Rise schools and principals designed around the  “Six Rise School Keys for continued improvement” then, Rise principals and their teams will have the tools and resources  to accelerate outcomes for ALL students and increase students’ access to an excellent and equitable education.    Structure of the Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP)   The Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for each  Rise school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, New  York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, Strong  Communities, including the following:   ●  Rise Benchmarks: please refer to the 2018-19 Rise benchmarks provided to your school.  ●  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and  documenting key areas of celebration and Rise through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Rise process.    ●  Setting mid-year point benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes and  goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five discrete  goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an action plan.  ●  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.   ●  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool   and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          5         ●   Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards (NGLS) and to support staff in effectively  responding to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.   ●  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.     The Framework for Great Schools and the R-CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Rise School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (R-CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review  and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities  and strategies that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          6         The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools      In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the American Institute of Research (AIR) Needs Assessment, the  NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools – they call it a Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement.  All Priority and Focus Schools and Focus   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Districts must use the new tool; and districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Education Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement         NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:     a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          8   a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the R-CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the R-CEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for R-CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Rise school and   meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Rise Key and the corresponding statement of   Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an  Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select  their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major  findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other  qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Discuss and respond to the guiding questions under each Framework element.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.     Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Rise Program Priorities    Our Rise Theory of Action (page 4) is drawn from research1 on turnaround schools, the DOE Framework for Great  Schools, DTSDE Tenets, and the Quality Review, which suggest that these key priorities have the greatest impact on  student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          9         RISE Keys   Priorities      1.

Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or  special initiatives being implemented.   Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are.   2.  3.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as   partners in furthering student achievement    4.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the   Framework for Great Schools and your Rise Benchmarks and indicate where this has been a challenge.   5.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Our school is geographically located on the Far Rockaway peninsula, which borders the Nassau County lines by a  quarter of a mile. We are a Title 1 school with approximately 25% of our students bussed to the school from nearby  housing developments. This school year we have experienced a population decrease of 50 students bringing the  school register to a total of 531 students. We are very proud to have added two additional two-3Pre-Kindergarten  classes bringing a total to five classes on this grade.    Mission Statement    The mission of P.S. 197Q is to ensure that all students acquire knowledge and develop skills and understandings  that will enable them to become productive citizens and lifelong learners. This mission is best accomplished  through a structure of communities that are committed to children and that are characterized by strong  instructional team leadership, increased opportunities to learn, time on task, a climate of high expectations for all  students, a safe and orderly school environment, frequent monitoring of students’ progress with appropriate  instructional adjustments to students’ programs, high levels of commitment to student success, an emphasis on  teaching for learning through the use of technology, socially emotional responsive practices, and extensive and  authentic family/school/community partnerships. At P.S. 197Q, we take responsibility for creating a respectful,  nurturing and successful learning environment.    At P.S.197Q, we believe that students learn best in an environment that centers on their individual needs and  support both academic and emotional growth. Our School was awarded the Apple Connect-Ed Grant supported by  President Barack Obama in order to address the disparity for schools with a large minority sub population with  access to technology via STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering Art and Math). Our project with Apple will focus  on rebuilding our Far Rockaway community post Hurricane Sandy. Students must have multiple opportunities to  engage in rich cognitively appropriate activities that develop and challenge their natural curiosity preparing them  for college and career readiness.    Our Student with Disabilities population is approximately 23.37% and our ELL (English Language Learners)  population is approximately 21.98%. We have a partnership with YMCA (Young Men Christian Association) this  program also offers after school STEAM (Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) enrichment programs  which serves over 200 of our students five days a week from 3:30-6:00 pm as well as homework assistance. This is  the second year from “The Child Center of New York” offering families support in the areas of academic growth and  social emotional care. In addition, to an on site mental clinic for at-risk students.   Our school has made the most growth in the area of developing student’s social and emotional health. Our School- wide Positive Behavior Intervention System is an approach that serves to teach students the critical character traits  that are acceptable in a community of productive citizens. In addition, the P.S. 197Q school community has  partnered with agencies (Bank Street for Socially Emotional Responsive Practice) that are able to support our  students' social emotional well-being. This approach enables teachers to be better equipped when responding to  the emotional needs of students’ while addressing the rigors of the Common Core Learning Standards. The Bank   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Street Emotionally Responsive Practice consultants provide support to all stakeholders by sharing best practice and  strategies that help staff/teachers "contained" children with childhood trauma. Our teachers address behaviors  and support children with social emotional challenges and needs. This partnership has enhanced the attention and  motivation for learning. The Young Men’s Christian Association provides structured activities for the children to  productively socialize during recess and after school programs. This year we partnered with TCIS (therapeutic crisis  intervention in schools) which is sponsored and hosted by our QBFSC (Queens Borough Field Support Center) as a  way of helping address student and teacher relationships when students are in crisis. Seven of our staff members  completed this 7 session cohort and we fully intend on sending additional personnel in the new school year. All of  these support systems will continue to further develop our Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health  (Tenet 5) by offering more direct parental involvement in our school which in turn will further our goal of more  parental engagement to our entire school community.   Describe the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school made the most progress over the  past year:   RISE PROGRESS During the 2017-2018 school year we were awarded rise school status 67 % benchmark Attendance,  Student achievement Metrics . As a result of meeting this benchmark, we continue to focus differentiated  professional development for both ELA and Math. We continue to add additional days of PD (National Training  Network, Math Solutions, Teachers College Reading Writing Project, ENL and Dual Language support) so that  teachers can enhance their pedagogy and their instruction with improved students’ learning outcomes. Teachers  have religiously met every Monday PD for 45 minutes to conduct the Data Wise Improvement Process (DWIP)  Protocol with their teacher teams which allowed them to be conversant about data in a granular fashion. The  teacher teams were able to reflect and work of the "problem of practice" which in turn allows them to revise, track  and monitor their delivery of instruction. Ultimately, they use this data to tweaked their lessons. By aligning the  STANDARDS to and analyzing pertinent data across the grade within a specific FOCUS AREA (Math, ELA, etc.,) teams  used specific data to create a PRIORITY QUESTION which then allowed teachers to get more granular in finding a  trend that informed them of a LEARNER-CENTERED PROBLEM. Teachers then used various strategies including  inter-visitation to identify a PROBLEM OF PRACTICE. From there, teams formed an ACTION PLAN on moving  forward to improve teacher performance in regards to the initial learner-centered problem.    During the 2017-2018 school survey, we received a score of 4.03 of positive responses in "Collaborative Teachers".  We organized our school schedule so that all grade teams teaching among teachers using a scheduling program that  allows teachers 2 common periods weekly promoting collaborative planning.    Our schools’ professional development plan, designed to meet individual teachers’ needs Support plans for  teachers was driven by professional development needs assessment survey via survey monkey during the month of  November. This has led to growth among teacher pedagogy and the infusion of rigorous instruction in teacher  created lesson plans. In addition, we provided targeted support for first year teachers through the Office of Teacher  Effectiveness. This past year, Long Island Jewish supported our scholars through an on-site mental health clinic. In  addition, the YMCA provided additional support to parents by providing "Keep Fit" program, and ENL evening  classes.   Some of the challenges our school faces that we are continuing to work on are in the following areas:    1. Student with Disabilities – We have 23.37% of our student population who have Individual Education Plans. In  real numbers, this means that 118 out of our 505 total students have a need for mandated academic, social and  emotional support.   2. English Language Learners – We have 21.98% of our student population who are students with language needs.  In real numbers, this means that 111 out of our 528 total students have a need for additional support in ENL  services. This year, we have had an influx of students from Central America some of whom are refugees and require  additional support. Due to this, we have been searching and are in need of a bilingual Spanish social worker.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          15      3. Resources – Far Rockaway is a hard to staff location and this affects the resources available in the community as  well as the resources available to come to the community. This adds to the struggle of enhancing school  partnerships and bringing in a variety of services to help our school community.   4. Pedagogy - In grades K-2, out of 13 teachers, seven are new to the profession, having three years or less.  Professional development is differentiated for these teachers in three buckets (pedagogy, content and grade  standards) coupled with social emotional practice as means of support for their instructional practices. With that,  instruction was differentiated according to teacher strength. In kindergarten, the need to focus on students  according to reading levels Our more experienced teachers worked with those students either at a low level or are  stagnant at a specific reading level; while our newer teachers, with support from the more experienced teachers,  worked with those students progressing.   Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.    This year, our staff voted 96% to have the Extended Learning Time (ELT) in the morning from 8:00-9:00 am (Monday  through Friday). Approximately 98% of teachers participate in teaching interventions for our scholars during this  period. This comes in the form of RTI support for our lowest performing students, and "pushables" and "slipables."  We have developed a schedule that will provide opportunities for our students to progress in areas of ELA and  Math while integrating Science and Social Studies. In kindergarten and 1st grade we are focusing on streaming our  students in order to identify all our students based on reading level and fluency. This is evidenced by the creation  of an RTI schedules that enables us to quickly monitor and make real time adjustments and changes as they are  needed. There will be 2 hours dedicated towards strengthening the academic needs in ELA with a focus on major  cluster standards and 2 hours in mathematics supporting the major cluster standards. In math we will also continue  to focus our attention on working with National Trainer Network consultants on using Key Elements of  Mathematics Success (KEMS) as a system of repeated practice centered around NYS math major cluster standards  We are beginning to provide professional development for teachers so that they are prepared to make shifts to  reflect the Next Generation Standards in all content area. The 5th hour will be used towards Enrichment activities  such as, 1-1 Small Groups, Homework Help, Drama/Performing Arts, STEM. In addition, we are providing Response  to Intervention during (ELT) Extended Learning Time (RTI) during the Renewal hour. After looking closely at the  State Tests results and additional data from teachers (NYS ELA/MATH test scores, item Skill Analysis via I-ready,  Performance Series), unit assessments, observations and Performance Tasks), students will be placed in strategic  groups during the Extended Learning Time, after school and Saturday academy throughout the school year.  Students will be grouped based on the following: Levels of Performance based on the Developmental Reading  Assessment in Grades 3-5 and Fountas & Pinnell in Grades K-2, GoMath Unit assessments, and Item Analysis (State  tests and Scantron). Benchmark assessments will take place in September, February, and June (MAY) in order to  gauge overall growth overall. Progress monitoring will take place in between each benchmark date as in readily  available via our dropbox site.            2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          16         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q197   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   498   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.  Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Based on the Framework for Great Schools Report 2016-2017 in the indicator of Rigorous Instruction, 89% responded  positively. Our pedagogical practices straightened as evidenced in the framework: lesson plans were designed to  reflect teacher knowledge of students with lessons designed with multiple entry points so that all students have  access to the same rigorous instruction. Small group instruction based on data from formative and summative  assessments addressed the needs for all students to maximize student learning. According to the 2016-2017 NYC  School Survey 97% of the teachers say they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and writing  grounded in evidence from text and 92% of teachers say they had the resources to include opportunities for  developing students' conceptual, procedural, and applied skills in math.    In accordance with the School Quality Guide-Online Edition, the measure of Shifts in Literacy, the school had a metric  value of 96%. The Great Schools Report 2017-2018 also indicated that in the indicator of Rigorous Instruction, in the  measure of Shifts in Math, the school had a metric value of 97%. The school leadership ensures and supports the  implementation of rigorous instruction aligned to grade specific Common Core Learning Standards. For example,  teachers develop units of study and lesson plans aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. In addition,  teachers, with the support of administrations, ensure that lessons integrate subjects such as Science and Social  Studies with daily /Math lessons.   In the 2016-17 Quality Review Report, it was noted that pedagogy needs improvement in relation to our SWD and  ELLs sub groups. With this thought in mind we were able to modify our math curriculum maps in order to help  identify the major cluster standards that were addressed this year. For example, teachers adjust curriculum based on   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          19      classroom assessments and formative data findings from teams so that a diversity of learners have access and all staff  can track and identify where curricular adjustments have been made. The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT)  monitors the intervention sorter to best meet the needs of our "pushables" and "slippables" students. The ILT also  created intervention groups through the school day in order to best meet the target needs of our students. One area  of focus for us this year is in Mathematics in grades three and five through tier II instruction. We will also focus on our  Kindergarten and First Grade where we will be implementing a streaming program that will address our emerging  readers. With this we will support them by developing their fluency and phonics levels by identifying targeted reading  levels and utilizing Fundations and small group instruction. This practice will accelerate their learning so that we can  diligently close the achievement gap.   The sources and data trends that were analyzed were the 2016-2017 Quality Review, 2016-2017 School Quality  Snapshot and the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide.               Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to increase our student’s interest and academic growth in  independent reading, robust writing and investigative mathematics via NTN ( National Training Network). We will  promote higher-order thinking through thought-provoking questioning and discussions in all subject areas. We will  continue to use checking for understanding to inform our student-needs and potential growth.             P.S. 197Q will continue to use the Teachers College Reading Writing Project in grades K-5. Teachers will experience  professional development both in-house with TC staff developers and attend specific TC Calendar Days at Columbia  University. Teachers will receive ongoing training specifically to promote independent reading and writing.    Supervisors will continue to utilize the Danielson Framework to gauge the growth of teacher practice in 3b  (Questioning and Discussion) by observations and snapshots followed by immediate actionable feedback as well as  ongoing professional development.       P.S. 197Q will continue to follow the Go-Math curriculum with the use of Key Elements to Math Success (KEMS) as a  supplemental program. Professional learning for all teachers will be delivered by consultants from National Training  Network (NTN) In grades K through 5. Teachers will continue to use strategies from previous professional  development programs (Math Solutions).    During the Expanded Learning Time (ELT), students will engage in additional rigorous activities targeting literacy and  mathematics via Response to Intervention (RTI). Our staff works collaboratively during common planning to ensure  that lessons are aligned in accordance with the Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers use their pedagogical  skills to provide students with multiple entry points during both small group and whole class instruction.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          20      During weekly professional learning time, we provide a 90 minute block of time of professional development for each  grade 3K through grade 5. During this time there will be opportunities for the staff to plan together and focus on the  achievement of common goals. This includes targeting improvement in Rigorous Instruction 3.95 as referenced by  Renewal EMS Benchmark 2018-2019. Common Teacher formative assessments in ELA/MATH will be developed by  our teachers enabling them to monitor student learning at the end of our Data Wise Inquiry Cycle. These project  based experiences will be guided by appropriate rubrics developed by the staff and students. We will support and  assess student work, based on trends, subgroups, teachers'/students’ performance. Our goal is to improve our last  years’ measurable gains in English Language Arts by (.10) and Mathematics by (.09) percentage points as measured  by the Rise Benchmark for 2018-2019. This goal will be supported and modified by formative results of Expanded  Learning Time, Response to Intervention (RTI) and Academic Intervention Services (AIS) provided by our coaches and  cluster teachers.            How will you implement a standards-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, including ELLs  and SWDs?  In order to best support our school's diverse learners, our school has implemented various technological assistant  tools such as: Smart Boards, Apple TV's, ELMOS and one-to-one Apple deployment, P.S. 197 is an Apple Connect  Recipient 2016. In addition, flexible scheduling is commonly practiced across the grades and we scaffold our  instruction to meet the needs of all diverse learners. We offer supplemental reading programs such as MyOn that  encourages reading through a diverse digital library. MindPlay is utilized by SWDs, i-Ready is used by students in  grades K-5 to target reading/Math gaps and build comprehension and fluency as well as number sense and algebraic  thinking . Our school implements curricula that meets academic needs through enrichment activities such as dance,  drumline, drama and STEM. We also have dual language classes on each grade as well as having Spanish and Haitian- Creole translators available. We use various applications that help engage all student subgroups such as Book  Creator, Kahoot, and seesaw which help students memorialize their ideas and outline their writing. Our school  implements curricula that meets academic needs through enrichment activities such as dance, drumline, drama and  STEM.                 What is your vision for ensuring that all student have access to rigorous coursework that moves them towards career  and college readiness? How will you support the personal and academic skills, habits, and behaviors needed for  students to be career and college ready?  Through our Teachers College Reading and Writing curriculum and our Go Math curriculum coupled with our  supplemental math program NTN (National Teacher Network), we have embedded the following instructional shifts  to help prepare our students for college and career readiness: We deliberately populate our leveled libraries with  informational and literary texts that help engage our students in conversations.   We emphasize that our students use evidence to back up their thoughts, opinions and arguments so that they are  prepared to make informed decisions that will impact their adult lives. In addition, we recognize that problem solving  is not merely found in math; it is found in everyday life. We teach our students in a way where they develop a deep  understanding of problems and concepts; where they realize that there are actually strategies to solving a problem  rather than a fast answer. Understanding that children learn best when they build on what they already know; we  promote coherence so that they are able to connect their learning across the grades onto their collegial paths.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          21               All of our programs are geared to fostering a whole child approach for all students to become college and career  ready learners with an emphasis on the core subject areas in Math, ELA, Science and the Arts. Our teachers are  trained to use technology through a three year apple grant training program one to one in order to minimize the  learning growth and disparity of use that exists in urban schools settings.     How do you envision embedding the elements of culturally responsive instruction and how will you know that  implementation is successful?  Delivery of instruction should closely align itself to the Danielson Framework for teaching and should foster an  outcome that is aligned to all of our P.S. 197Q data sources. Using the Data Wise Protocol, teachers will identify  trends, determine student- centered problems, form tiered groups and adjust lessons to meet the individual needs of  their students as indicated by strategic data sources represented in the school.     What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Multiple entry points will be used to address academic areas of improvement in all of our students in particular our  SWDs and ELL sub population. By addressing the areas of deficiency through a tiered approach for learning and  tracking of data via the intervention New Vision Sorter will allow for measurable growth to be more evident in a  timely manner. As well as provide teachers with a more linear infusion of realistic student performance by both  content area and standards based.     How do you envision differentiating teacher professional learning opportunities to support instructional foci, meet  students’ unique needs and advance culturally responsive education in your school?  The purpose of both our formative and summative assessment plan is two fold. First and foremost it is to inform our  instruction for the purpose of pursuing of academic excellence. The second reason is the growth and development of  our teaching strategies to develop a more centrally aligned with the instructional vision.       Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Rigorous Instruction.

School Strengths - In growing a supportive environment that best serves our diverse student population, the school  community understands the importance of creating and sustaining a safe physical and learning environment where  students are engaged both social-emotionally and academically. With that P.S. 197Q has instituted several initiatives  and practices:      Social-Emotional Response Practice Professional Development for Teachers: Bank Street professional  developers work with teachers in both classroom settings and during professional development sessions such  as Lunch and Learns and specific Professional Development days. Lunch and Learns and Professional  Development supported the in-classroom support with hands-on coaching and strategies.      Morningside Center for Restorative Practice: Professional Development and in-classroom coaching was   conducted to “allow for a shift in practice that results in a culture which is inclusive, builds fair process into  decision-making practices, and facilitates students learning to address the impact of their actions through an  approach that allows for true accountability, skill building, cooperation, and mutual understanding.”   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          31        Collaborative Teachers Teams: P.S. 197Q has proudly formed Collaborative Teaching Teams where teachers         plan together and create open communication. Ideas are shared and strategies learned from professional  development are molded and refined. Coaches, mentors and administration provide ongoing support during  team meetings and professional development sessions.   School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) - The Child Center of NY has partnered with PS 197 The Ocean School to  establish a Wellness Center. This center operates a clinic that provides on-site, multilingual health services to  students and families at the school including preventing, ongoing, and crisis-related interventions. Students  have sessions that are both individual and in groups. Group sessions offer the students a safe forum where  they can express themselves respectfully and work on problem-solving strategies.   Student Support Team: This team, comprised of our full-time guidance counselor, school psychologist and  social worker (both mono and bilingual) meet consistently to discuss individual student needs as well as work  to develop school-wide plans and initiatives that build on school safety and discipline. The Student Support  Team works closely and collaboratively with the CCNY Mental Health Clinic to provide evidence-based  therapies and strategies for students with emotional distress and/or behavior problems.      Crisis Team - Crisis Team intervention ranges from on-the-spot de-escalation for a student in crisis to the need   to create an action plan due to a building-wide or even city-wide crisis or issue. The Crisis Team can include  the guidance counselor, school psychologist, social worker, mental health counselors and the administration  team.    As an outgrowth of a positive behavior centered system, the school has developed a set of Core Values to provide  clarity regarding student behaviors. These PBIS/Core Values are: Cooperation, On Task, Respect and Effort.    Priority Areas of Focus – Although measurable of progress has been made in the area of Supportive Environment, the  school will be addressing the following needs:     Enrichment support and activities as managed and conducted by the Child Center of New York to increase   positive student engagement during recess.      Working closely with safety agents to carefully monitor all visitors to the building.      Student Mentoring – Refine the Success Mentoring Program to ensure students with chronic attendance  issues are working with a mentor to increase positive attendance. With this we will work in collaboration with  The School Leadership Team and CBO.     Data resources indicate that from 2016 -2017 to 2017-2018 the overall number of incident reports and   suspensions have been reduced. For instance, overall suspensions were reduced by 84% and superintendent  suspensions by 100%.                 Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you, in partnership with each CBO and families,  enact your vision?  Stakeholders describe our school as a place where students are at the heart of all decisions of everything done at The  Ocean School - P.S. 197. Our partnership with the Child Center of New York which our community school partner. In  addition, we shared space and after school programs with the YMCA community based organization. Together,  collectively we support all scholars and their families through enrichment, arts, sports coupled with parent  workshops. We have also partnered with the New York City Food Bank and have a food pantry in which serve over   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          32      200 families on a weekly basis. The following are some of the highlights in ways of how we support our school  environment:      Scholars receive high quality education with engaging experiences that support their maturity and growth as  life-long learners.     Additionally the YMCA and the Child Center of New York are CBOs who offer services for families and   students during the academic school day and after.      We also have dental, eyeglass and mental health services available for families. It is through this additional      support that our students receive the emotional support needed to become well rounded citizens and  contributors in society.   Student voice is heard via the student council monthly meeting. During these meetings student  representatives from across grades meet with school leadership and discuss ideas as well as the  implementation of systems and structures that support the entire school community.     Our school has been using PBIS Core Value framework for the past fourteen years focusing on the   development of the social emotional needs of all scholars. We continue to partner with the Child Center of  New York and expand our counseling services by 30% to children who have been identified as at risk for social  and emotional support. Also based on needs assessment in this area the CCNY will be adding an additional  social worker intern to help manage our student caseload as well as an additional Bilingual social worker. Our  OORS data and reports provides critical information which the PBIS team monitors the number of incidents  per students and the level of infractions. These are the students that are supported through our PBIS team.  All of this data also can be found in our schools new vision data sorter which is also shared with our district  office and is monitored bi-weekly by all parties.   This year our attendance rate for September was 9.34%. Currently we are focusing on improving the rate by 1.4%  resulting in an attendance rate of 94.2% by June 2019. As measured by our 2017-2018 Rise Attendance Benchmark.  We gather and track data from ATS for students whose attendance is less than 92% on a monthly basis by tiering  these students with additional support and guidance to the parents of these students through various parental  workshops i.e family engagement, Attendance team phone calls and home visits as well as breakfast with the  principal to name a few.    We will also continue to develop our success mentoring program with the aid of newly hired school aides to support  identifying students whose attendance is a concern or less than 90%. The Child Center Of New York which is our  community based organization works throughout the academic school year to flag and monitor student attendance  which is then shared with our weekly attendance committee meetings. During these meetings, the Attendance  Committee which is comprised of the principal, assistant principal, guidance counselor, CBO director, attendance  teacher, parent coordinator, pupil accounting secretary, Asthma Case Manager reviews the ATS reports such as the  Report of Daily Attendance List (RADL). The Attendance Committee also discuss the New Vision dashboard and the  data that is collected via the student sorter. Daily phone calls are made for students who are absent. In addition, we  follow up with post card as well as a automated phone call via school messenger. The guidance counselor reaches out  to families to address attendance concerns. Both the attendance teacher, Asthma case manager and the parent  coordinator conduct visits to students' home with chronic absenteeism due to health related issues.   We have shared our high expectations and communicated the importance of coming to school everyday by  advertising and celebrating scholars via a bulletin board by the main office. The principal also speaks about the  importance of coming to school every day over the PA system during the morning message.         Describe your plan to implement a culture of trust and high expectations for teachers, students, families and  community partners.  During our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, 93% of the staff/parents responded positively to questions about  "trust." Ongoing communication and transparency are key elements for building trust within our school. With  students, trust is reflected through the continuous support of our Bank Street partnership via (Teddy Bear workshop),  "success mentors" and staff members that create safe learning environments.

Teachers reach out regularly to families regarding their scholars' academic and social needs. Our  community partners both the Child Center of New York (CCNY) and the Young Men Christian Academy YMCA are  supportive and diligently working to increase our strong family-community ties in Far Rockaway. Both YMCA and  CCNY host family events in the evenings throughout the year. These events allow the parents to participate and  engage them in the educational process of our scholars.

According to the American Institution for Research (AIR) Assessment conducted during the Spring  2015, some teachers reported lack of opportunities to observe their colleagues classrooms.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     Teacher collaboration is celebrated at P.S. 197Q. All classroom and cluster teachers will receive at least three  common planning periods per week. Teachers will meet with their colleagues and administrators once a week during  their professional period to collaborate in designing coherent instruction. During these meetings, teachers,  administrators and coaches will review assessments, identify trends, and determine strengths along with the areas of  need for scholars. Teachers will plan individualized project based activities to support high achieving students. There  are several underlying principles that influence teacher and learning. Teachers will plan lessons aligned to the  Common Core Learning Standards as well as utilize Engage NY to ensure all scholars are provided with deep rigorous,  and though provoking learning experiences to address the needs of all scholars including scholars with SWDs, ELLs,  and higher achieved. All classrooms will have rules that are created by the scholars and agreed upon by the teachers.   We are planning to continue and expand our peer collaborative teacher and model teacher program for the June  2018-2019. Peer collaborative teachers will work with classroom teachers through professional development sessions  including lunch and learns, push in lesson modeling and inter visitation.    Teachers will ensure that classroom rules are aligned to the school wide discipline policy. This policy is based on the  Chancellor's policy on discipline and revised to meet the needs of our school community. Rules will also be aligned to  meet the PBIS Core matrix rubric.   Teachers will consistently review formative/informative classroom data collected during the delivery of instruction.  Teachers will in teams to address student's progress across grades within varied content areas. In collaborative  teams, teachers use Exit slips, quick checks, text-based conversations, and conference notes to identify student needs  and identify targeted groups.

As school we conduct ongoing assessments in grades K-5. In grades K-2 teachers will utilize the Fountas and Pinnell  reading assessment and DRA will be used in grades 3-5. In addition, students will be tested using the iReady  assessment three times a year; in addition to the ongoing lessons used through this program. With that, the data  obtained from these assessments informs teachers and administration of a student's academic needs. The school  utilizes "DropBox" to monitor student's progress throughout the year. This data will inform teachers and  administrators as to how students are performing and or students are struggling. Supports will be provided by  teachers. Tier 1 interventions will be provided by classroom teachers. When students did not respond to a Tier 1  intervention, Tier II interventions will be implemented in cycles of 6 to 8 weeks. RTI providers will support students'  academics areas of need.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.  By June 2019, One hundred percent of the teachers will continue to focus on a full school-wide immersion of the Data  Wise Improvement process through six week cycles using their common planning periods and professional  development time. Teachers will use research-based protocols to analyze and align student work with assessments,  rubrics and checklists.

Include the timeline and  identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  Teachers will meet with parents in September during Back to School Evening. Expectations for students will be  delivered by the classroom teachers individually according to class yet based on the collaboration between the  grades. With this collaboration, while each classroom teacher may have their own way of presenting, the  expectations will be grade-wide and consistent.    Parent-Engagement Tuesdays will offer parents the opportunity to meet with the teacher; not only for  understanding the progress of the student; to also gain knowledge of what is being taught. This will include  curriculum, projects and extended learning.    Teachers will discuss strategies parents can use at home to extend learning. This could include trips parents and  children within their own neighborhood and city that relates to the work they are doing in school. This could be an  extension of a unit of study being taught in literacy or a social studies unit that focuses on cultures and  neighborhoods.    Common planning meetings are venues where these strategies can be discussed, formed and prepared.  Administration will be a part of the common planning and can discuss with teachers time lines for implementation.  Reflective discussions will also take place to monitor the success of the implementation and to see ultimately if  what is being extended to the home is being returned in the form of student understanding.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      Based on the 2017-2018 NYC School Quality Guide, 93% of the teachers reported that the principal at the school  communicates a clear vision for the school and sets high standards for student learning.       The 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report, there were 98% positive responses in the area of inclusive principal  leadership and 91% positive responses in the area of principal instructional leadership. According to the 2017-2018  NYC School Quality Guide, 93% of teachers say they make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with  instruction at other grade levels.   An area of school strength is the manner in which we invite and embrace the entire school community by conducting  parent workshops, ongoing professional development for teachers; close communication with parents and hands-on  attendance at Parent Association meetings. In addition, we conduct PBIS meetings with our students and hold Career  Day which involves parents and community members. Our Dolphin Dollars program is a reward system that gives our  students an incentive for positive behavior. Our building leaders include all stakeholders when making strategic  decisions.

Our high expectations are evidenced by  classroom learning environments and student-teacher relationships. Teachers make every effort to address students’  individual instructional needs through ongoing formative and summative assessments, individual and small-group  instruction, peer tutoring and continuous parent communication. Our school has structures and systems in place that  promote high quality learning experiences for our students such as teacher teams, academic trips to the Queens  District Attorney's Office, and a rigorous curriculum that includes Go Math, NTN, Teachers College Writing project,  higher order thinking questioning skills such as making predictions, comparing and contrasting different texts, etc....  We pride ourselves on making every family feel welcomed and ensure that their child(ren) are happy and safe.   Our area of need focuses on leadership's desire to effectively analyze student data based on assessments, teacher  judgement, parent surveys and meetings with support staff such as the Guidance Counselors, Response to  Intervention (RTI) and SETSS teachers. Additionally, leadership will expand their utilization of the Danielson  Framework, the Common Core Learning Standards and Columbia Teachers College Reading/Writing Project to  enhance the evaluation of teacher pedagogy. Leaders will make sure that horizontal and vertical common planning  periods are used for collaboration to identify patterns, trends and next steps across grades by utilizing Data Wise  Improvement Process In addition to a weekly common planning vertical/horizontal Dual Language meeting with  coaches and supervisors.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?      School Leadership will articulate a shared vision and mission to the entire school community through weekly grade  meetings, Monday's Professional Development, Staff Handbook, The Child Center of New York, ongoing collaboration  with the Community School Director, and the Y After-school Program including their director and staff. The partners  of the Child Center of New York will collaborate with school staff through hosting monthly parental workshops, staff  meetings, professional development, special events that highlight student achievement and community relations.  Based on the 2016-2017 NYC School Survey Report 93% of parents who participated felt that the school staff regularly  communicated with parents/guardians about how staff can help students learn.    Evidenced-based systems that the school leader has put in place to ensure that the school and individuals continue to  improve include Scantron Performance Series 3 times a year, Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) 3 times a  year, Progress Monitoring (DRA) 2 times a year, Ongoing teacher feedback using the Danielson Framework Tool,  Teacher's College Writing Units of Study measured by Common Core aligned rubrics and GoMath unit assessment  data. The Literacy Coach and Math Coach will model, conduct inter-visitations and learning rounds based on the data  from snapshots, and summative/formative assessments.   The leader would organize student and teacher programs to ensure students' needs are met by:   · professional learning communities   · Professional Development Mondays,    · bi-weekly teacher team meetings,    · Lunch and Learns,    · per session activities,    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          51      · bi-monthly leadership team meetings,    · on-site and off-site staff training by subject specific consultants   These opportunities, along with coordinated scheduling, allow for teachers’ professional responsibilities to be aligned  with the school’s instructional goals, thereby focusing teacher time on instructional work and data analysis resulting  in improved instruction that engages all students in rigorous academic tasks.    Students' needs will be met by:     Gathering and identifying trends/patterns in student data    Guided Reading instruction based on specific skills/strategies    Extended Learning Time (organized based on academic needs)    Weekly Skill of the Week assessment tracking data    Emphasis on Higher Order Thinking questioning and discussion   The school leader strategically conducts observations in coordination with assistant principals and designs feedback  aligned to the Danielson's Framework. This feedback is communicated to teachers in a timely manner that allows for  teachers to demonstrate growth in observed areas.   The systems that will be developed to share academic, behavior, Social Emotional Learning (SEL), and attendance  with partners so that strategies can be created and assessed to support student growth are     Weekly meetings and discussions with the Child Center of New York in collaboration with P.S. 197's   Attendance Teacher to monitor chronic absences     Monthly PBIS awards celebrations (Reader of the Month, Student of the Month, Mathematician of the   Month, Scientist of the Month, Historian of the Month, and Demonstration of Good Character of the Month)    Emotional Responsive Practice (bank Street College)- Works with both teachers and students on coping with   emotional and potentially stressful situations in and out of school     Daily behavior growth plans and incentive programs have been in place to monitor progress in behavior and   continue constant communication with parents about their child(ren) status.     Every member of the staff participates and infuses our Positive Behavior Matrix throughout all grades during   the school day. Students are taught social-emotional responsibilities through PBIS, Bank Street, YMCA  structured lunch and after school programs, and strategies taught through TAC-D.   The leader will delegate and empower the assistant principals to lead common planning meetings, evaluate and  support teachers/staff members, conduct snapshots/formal observations using the Danielson Framework, provide  immediate feedback, identify professional development opportunities that are catered to the individual and school- wide needs. The leader will delegate and ensure that the Community School Director will survey, identify  trends/patterns, and create an action plan to meet the needs of all stakeholders in the school community.           What are your core belief(s) for school improvement and how they inform your vision for developing instructional  leadership at your school?  Administration will include a system which will reflect proper "norming" protocols for all administrators with regards  to teacher observations and actionable feedback. Feedback meetings will utilize the rubric from observation to  observation to monitor the growth of a teacher in specific components. Teachers set specific goals according to their  ratings in their end of year summary report and will those goals as an area of focus throughout the year. Leadership  will work with teachers on these goals to monitor and improve instructional growth.       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          52                What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Our administration has a clear understanding of the need to share and grow knowledge with all our key stakeholders.  For example, teachers and coaches are required to work with grade leaders in developing model lessons; and grade  level appropriate professional development which is then shared as a best practice for all of our teachers and staff.     How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  This will be accomplished through a shared vision model where all school parties PTA, SLT, Grade Leaders, Coaches,  Safety team, CBO staff are all vested with the common purpose of providing support to parents through an open line  of communication and town hall meetings.

As per 2017-2018 School Survey 98% pf parents feel that school staff regularly communicate with them about how  they can help their child learn; 96% said that they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, 99% of families say  that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit their school and 98% of families said that teachers work closely  with them to meet their child's needs. In order to maintain this higher parental support we will continue to offer  workshops and one on one meetings during Parent Engagement time as well, engaging parents in classroom  instructional celebrations (Publishing Parties, cultural assemblies, etc...) and providing parent opportunities to watch  instruction in the classrooms.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for strong family and community ties at your school?  What opportunities exist for the school staff  to know the students and their families in order to better communicate and partner with families and communities in  the vision for the school?  P.S. 197Q is a Community School which embraces and supports parental engagement and involvement. Our learning  environment is supported by our two safety agents who warmly meet and greet parents. In addition, P.S. 197Q offers  bilingual services in Spanish.    Communication to parents is offered in the language of their choice. We also provide translations during our PTA  meetings and cultural school-wide events including Parent-Teacher Conferences.   The school and the Child Center of New York/YMCA work collaboratively to support parents. There is dedicated space  for families such as a welcoming parent room with a computer, fax machine, leveled libraries and a couch.   We presently offer a weekly two hour, ESL program for parents and caregivers. We also offer translation services and  we also send student data in two languages. In addition, we create and provide a monthly grade-level newsletter for  all families.         Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?  We currently have a fully staffed PTA office with active parental involvement. We also have two Community Based  Organizations (CBO): The Child Center of New York and the Far Rockaway YMCA. Both support our students with  enrichment activities and academic assistance. The Child Center of New York supports our school with attendance  tracking and parent outreach support. A parent involvement committee consisting of all school stakeholders will be  formed to meet once a month to collaborate all of our resources and guidance to further develop parental outreach  to our community.         How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school governance  structures?  Parent engagement and developing more parental outreach and planning workshops on school vision. Our CBO, the  Child Center of New York is instrumental in working with us to create and implement workshops and activities that  involve all families. Cookshop and the Food Pantry are two examples of programs that have involved families.  Cookshop has been especially beneficial because it teaches skills such as creative cooking. The School Leadership  Team meets monthly as well. That team consists of parents, teachers and administrators and works together as one  voice to create ideas for all school subjects including parent involvement.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          60            How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  Teachers and stakeholders will collaborate in the delivery of parent workshops with a focus in social emotional  learning, and parent outreach using different forms of family engagement: social media, twitter and school  messenger. Parent involvement seminars are will be coordinated with our CBO ( Child Center of New York) as well as  ongoing Teachers' College Reading/Writing project and Go Math digital resources for home use. This will elevate the  engagement and participation of our parent community and foster continued trust and collaboration for the  upcoming 2018-2019 school year.          How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for  families?

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.

Expanded Learning Time (ELT) was developed based on students need as it relates to both June instructional data  and State wide assessment data , as determined by the administrators, coaches and teachers using current and  historical data. The range of activities reflect students interest and need. All UFT members were surveyed as to  determine the most effective time to delivery ELT.    The specific learning needs of our ELLs, SWDs, below-level, on-level and above-level students will be addressed  through Response to Intervention (RTI), data analysis, planning toward multi-entry points, differentiated  instruction, and allocation of available resources. ELT will provide opportunities for students to develop self- confidence in their learning .    Administration through the use of the Basic Education Data System (BEDS) system ensures that all learning  experiences will be supervised and administered by NYS certified teaching professionals.    As we develop and solidify our relations with the CBO, its personnel will become part of the P.S 197Q school  culture and community. They are encouraged to participate and engage with teachers and support staff in  professional development activities. CBO partners will impact student achievement by supporting specific  classrooms consistently.    CBO employees from the Child Center of New York work in various capacities including in clubs during lunch time  and as Mental Health counselors. Mental Health Counselors have conducted professional development workshops  for teachers on social emotional strategies for students. These strategies have helped teachers work with students  from the ELT through to the end of the school day.         Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight  Part 4a.

P.S. 197 is dedicated to providing support to the Child Center of NY who is the Community School based CBO  partner. The director will then schedule a structured time for co-planning and collaborating on program for  students on a continual basis.    The following program will help address the school needs in the following areas:   The PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports) program addresses the school wide core learning principles  that are incorporated in our school vision. The school building leader and her administrative cabinet will  systematically implement this initiative in a manner that promotes our school vision.         Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct  the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   By June 2019, there will be a 12% increase in parental participation and engagement in school wide events and  workshops as related to parental needs assessment data. School leaders will work with the parent coordinator and  the members of the Parent Teachers Association / School Leadership Team to develop a system wide parental  survey which assess the needs, views, and opinions of parents.          Please answer the following question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  By engaging school stakeholders and members of our school community we are further reaching our goal of  informing parents of various events through the use of student monthly calendars, school messenger phone  system, and parent notices as needed. Additionally, our PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) schedules monthly  meetings with families as part of their D-PAC initiative to support struggling schools. To monitor the efficacy of  parent outreach, a time is dedicated at our school leadership team to address and highlight our success and  determine next steps.   Professional learning communities will be established by the School Building Leader to identify the student’s  progress in the case studies and share best practices with the learning communities. Time will be devoted to cross  collaboration with all members of this learning community to analyze and disaggregate ongoing data.         Part 2 – Community School Program Description   Part 2a. Identify the CBO partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and  Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services provided.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Teaching assignments are designed with the intent to bridge the achievement gap thereby increasing student  achievement and learning. Coaches and lead teachers are provided with professional learning opportunities to  develop proficiency in their respective subject areas. This learning is then disseminated to the staff during  Professional Development (PD) Monday or “Lunch & Learn” for all teachers. In addition, all first year teachers have  mentors that serve as guides who support them with necessary strategies and best practices to be implemented to  meet student academic needs.    We have extended our partnership with the Office of Teacher Recruitment & Quality and their Staffing & Retention  Support Program. In our work together, we have enhanced our work around recruitment, retention and support,  and building leadership capacity.          2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Professional Development combined with collaboration is at the core of increasing our students' capacity. Teacher  teams are afforded numerous opportunities to meet ranging from Professional Development Mondays, weekly  teacher-team meetings, Lunch and Learns, per session activities, bi-monthly leadership team meetings, training  from on-site consultants, and off-site staff training. These meetings are structured so that teachers' professional  responsibilities are aligned with the school's instructional goals, thereby focusing teacher time on instructional  work and data analysis and resulting in improved instruction that engages all students in rigorous academic tasks.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A        Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  The Pre-K social worker, along with the Pre-Kindergarten teachers, meets with parents of prospective Pre- Kindergarten students to discuss curriculum alignment to the ECERS assessment model. Workshops are provided to  the parents on an ongoing basis to enhance parents’ interaction with scholars to enhance their preparation for  kindergarten. The Pre-K social worker also meets with all incoming special education parents during registration to  ensure that services will be provided from the first day of school.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Because the school uses the ECERS assessment model, one-third of the school day is spent in learning centers  where the focus is on the growth of socializing through the building of peer to peer interaction. The CLASS  assessment and implementation focuses on teacher-student interactions throughout the school day in three areas:  Instructional Support; Emotional Support and Classroom Organization.              4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (R-CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/R-CEP.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          79        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          80      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  R-CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student  achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective  involvement of parents and community in the school. P.S. 197 The Ocean School, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school  and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning  and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on  the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 197 The Ocean School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          81      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Students will receive support in both ELA and  MATH  content areas. The ENL and  or Bilingual teacher and a common branch teacher will instruct  ELL students to achieve the  expected common core standards for their grade level as well as to achieve proficiency in the  four modalities . The teacher (s) will use and implement strategies and skills that will enhance  ELL English proficiency levels and improve their core academic content knowledge. While  using the new language scholars will develop fluency in the reading, writing, listening, and/or  speaking modalities.  Saturday Academy Letters will be sent home in both English and Spanish. For other  languages such as Haitian Creole, French and Korean, school staff that speak those languages  will contact those parents. When a translator is needed for a specific language and is not  available from the school, the Translation and Interpretation Unit within the Department of  Education (DOE) will be contacted.  On an ongoing basis, school staff and resources such as the parent coordinator, the ENL  coordinator, guidance counselors and administrators  will contact parents to inform about the  specific services and events. Attendance is a key component of a student's and the school's  success. With that, all attendance records, family-notification letters and call logs will be  maintained  in the main office.  1. When new content is introduced, teachers will implement appropriate and effective strategies  such as scaffolding, building on prior knowledge and the use of relevant anchor charts.  These will be used to  support the students'  learning and  development of the L2.  With the use  of these skills students will  apply the L2 when listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Throughout the year students  will be informally assessed in all four modalities.  Through the use  of the Depth of Knowledge questioning levels and the use of higher order questioning,  teachers  will continuously support and promote student engagement. Through the use of accountable talk,  students will have the opportunity to develop their speaking and listening skills. While  supporting students' learning and the development of the four modalities, students  will have  more opportunities to enrich their academic language.  This will help them when working in all  content areas.    We want all of our students to grow and succeed. Specifically concerning our ELL students, our  overall goal is for them to move up an emerging/entering proficiency level to a transitioning  level on the NYSESLAT Assessment. From there, our teachers work towards our ELL students  moving from the expanding level to the commanding level of proficiency on the  NYSESLAT Assessment. Students in grades 3 though 5 that have performed below level 2 on  the NYS ELA (those students in the U.S.A. for more than one year) and NYS Math Tests will be  invited to participate in our Saturday and After-School Academies.  Our ELL students in grades  K-2 will be invited to our After School Academy based on their progress on the  iReady Diagnostic Assessments as well as the Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments and  ongoing running records.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          88      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Similarly to what was written above, student progress will be measured by using formative and  summative assessments. This includes, but is not limited to the iReady Diagnostic Assessmetns,  DRA (Developmental Reading Assessment), Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments (K-2),  Frye Word lists, On-Demand Writing Pieces, End of Chapter and Unit assessments, one-to-one  conferring and ongoing running records. Data obtained from these ongoing assessments will be  used and analyzed to drive and move instruction to target students' needs. Teachers will identify  students' strengths and weaknesses to target the areas of need.  2. Title III funds will be used for enrichment and supplementary activities. It will take place  during the After School Academy and our Saturday Academy. The purpose of the program is to  enhance student skills in listening, reading, writing, and math.   After-School classes will contain up to 15 students per class in grades K-5;  A bilingual teacher  and/or an ENL teacher will support  the common branch teacher. Students will be selected based  on their level of performance on state tests. Students who performed on level 1 and 2 on  the ELA or Math tests and those who performed from the Entering to the Transitioning levels on  the NYSESLAT Test will be invited to participate in the After-School and Saturday Academies.  During After-School and Saturday Academy sessions, the  teachers will prepare students for the  New York State ELA, and Math tests as well as the NYSESLAT assessment. Students in grades  K-2  will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 -5:00 pm in our After-School Academy.  Students in grades 3-5 will participate in our Saturday Academy from 9:00 am - 12:30 pm. It will  start in October of 2018 and run through June of 2019.    Students will be grouped by grade band level. When preparing lessons,  teachers will scaffold  instruction and use Tier II interventions to support student needs. Students will be provided with  various resources, teacher created materials and the online Imagine Learning program which will  be used for at least 30 minutes per week to support students that are performing on the entering  or emerging proficiency levels. These resources will support students with the use and  development of the new language during daily conversation and in the classroom. In addition,  the online i-Ready  program will also be used to support students.  3. Approximately one hundred students from grades K-5 will participate in the After-School and  Saturday Academies. The main focus is to prepare students with specific reading skills in order  to enhance their reading comprehension. Educators will promote and build on students' prior  knowledge through the explicit teaching of content area vocabulary. Enriched vocabulary  knowledge will allow students to deepen their reading comprehension,  which will  put them on  the path to becoming successful readers and master the skills needed for the NYS ELA and Math  Tests and NYSESLAT Assessment.  As data for the  2017 NYSESLAT indicates, students were lacking in reading and writing skills.  The deficiency in these two modalities is preventing ELL students from performing in  the expanding or commanding proficiency levels. Teachers will be equipped with the necessary  resources and materials needed to support student development and skills necessary for College  and Career Readiness.    Results from the 2017 Spring NYSESLAT showed that about 18% of students performed at the  emerging proficiency level.  46% of  students performed at the transitioning level. 32% of  students performed at the expanding proficiency level and 3.5% of students performed at the  entering level. While 46% of our students performed at the transitioning level, many of those  students still demonstrated a need for growth in the reading and writing modalities. As  mentioned above, our Saturday and After-School Academies will support students with those  needs.   During the After-School and Saturday Academies students will be assessed through multiple  formative assessments including running records; end of unit assessments, performance tasks and  teacher-made assessments. During professional development sessions, teachers will collect and  analyze data to determine students' progress as well as the effectiveness of the academies.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          89         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   P.S.197 will provide rigorous instruction for students who scored at levels 1 and 2 on the ELA  and/or MATH Tests and for those who are at the Entering and Emerging proficiency levels on  the NYSESLAST assessment.  Students living in the U.S.A. for up to one year, at  the entering, emerging and transitioning levels as well as ELLs in grades 3-5 (testing grades) will  be invited to participate in the After-School and Saturday Academies.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 197 students in grades K-3 are assessed with Estrellita and the Spanish Development Reading Assessment  DRA. Students in  grades 3-5 are also assessed twice a year with the ELL Benchmark Fall and Spring Assessment Performance Test; together with  the DRA,  and TCRWP. Based on the outcomes of these assessments, students who did not meet their learning targets will  begin receiving RTI Tier II support for a 6 week cycle. If students do not show improvement they will participate in a another  cycle.    School staff will collaborate with teacher interventions to provide remediation to those students who are not able to show  adequate progress.  During grade common planning periods teachers will meet and plan lessons based on students needs.    The LAP Team and the School Based Instructional Leadership Team will continuously monitor progress to see if it aligns with  the SCREP goals.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          95      Teachers in grades K-5 will provide RTI Tier I and Tier II intervention to students in small groups. Tier I intervention will be done  in the classroom, Tier II will be in class and outside the class. Students will intervene with the Fundations phonics- based program. Teachers will participate in Fundations training to support students to develop the areas of decoding, fluency,  vocabulary, sentence structure, and reading comprehension skills. The RTI Team will support ELL students who did not make  progress in the first cycle.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Data from the Fall Benchmark periodic assessments, Spring 2018 NYSESLAT Assessment,  class assessments and performance  tasks will be utilized and analyzed to determine the student's area of need. The Data results will help identify students' areas  of strengths and focus. At the end of each cycle, data collected will be revised and analyzed  by the school team in order  to  help determine the appropriate  supports and resources  for students to be able to meet or exceed standards and improve  their skills.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school team composed by the school administrators and coaches will analyze the results and identify the appropriate  resources and interventions for students who are in need of remediation or extra support.  Students in grades K-5 will  receive  RTI Tier I intervention.  These interventions will be provided  by the classroom teacher 30 minutes  a day -five times  per week. For RTI Tier II intervention, students will be grouped in groups no larger than six-three times per week for 45  minutes. In addition, students will be  invited to participate in the After-School and Saturday Academies.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Data is analyzed by the school leaders and teachers. After identifying student trends, students are grouped based on their  needs. The school uses a researched-based phonics program: "Fundations"  for grades K-2 to support TIER I and Tier II  students, TIER I intervention is provided by the classroom teacher, Tier II will be  provided by classroom teacher when  providing guided reading in the classroom. In addition,  the LLI (level Literacy Intervention) and SPIRE reading programs are  utilized to support students outside the classroom.  Students participate in small groups of  6.  for TIER 2. Students participate  in cycles of 6 to 8 weeks and if  scholars do not show improvement they will be offered one more cycle. If after these two  cycles scholars still do not show improvement they will be referred to the SIT Team (School Intervention Team) to analyze  student progress. If the students  are still in need of academic support, they might be referred for an evaluation.  The RTI Teacher will pull out students to provide instruction in all areas of reading and in math. If students do not show  progress they will continue receiving RTI support. Data results will be analyzed at the end of each cycle to identify if students  have made progress or not.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The 2017 NYSESLAT Scores revealed that  3% of students performed at the entering level, 18%  performed at the  emergent level, 32% at the Expanding and 46% at the transitioning Proficiency Level. After analyzing student results we  noticed that most of the scholars still show weaknesses in for Reading and Writing.  Students' writing scores ranges from 000  to 012. These results indicate that teachers and providers need to support and provide students with the necessary skills  to  develop their writing skills. Reading scores run from 005 as the lowest to 024 as the highest.  Even though reading scores in  general are higher than writing compared to 2016-2017 results,  the Listening and Speaking sections data results shows that  students are performing better overall within those particular sections.  NYSITELL Data for the school year 2017-2018  shows that out of 27 Newcomers, 21 are kindergarten students. When analyzing  the data it is noticed that 38% of students performed at the Emerging level, 30% performed at the Entering level, 15% at the  Transitioning level and 18% at the Expanding Level.  With these results the school vision is to focus on supporting students in developing their Listening, Speaking, Reading and  Writing skills.  Using Multi-entry points, differentiated instruction,  QTEL strategies and weekly reading skills the homeroom  and the ENL teachers will support ELLs in developing their writing skills..    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          96                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The school will support students by providing RtI Intervention to students who are struggling. The school will develop a  plan  and will be carried through. Each intervention cycle is tailored to support the needs of struggling students. Using the data For  example, the team can provide  recommendations  and support teachers provide specific Tier 1 instructional strategies and  monitor student progress measuring the specific skill the intervention is targeting. For students needing more intense support,  Tier 2 small-groups or one-on-one tutoring interventions will take place with the RTI  teacher and or coaches during the  ELT time period. These sessions may last 35 minutes a day, three days a week to 45 minutes a day, five days a week depending  on the intervention plan. The duration of the Tier 2 intervention may also vary depending on the skill being mastered.  The  RTI provider and the intervention will focus on the following:  During intervention sessions  providers will  not help a student with homework or help study for a quiz or test. The  Interventions will be specific and are carried out to help a student master specific skills. For example, if a student is struggling  with reading comprehension, an intervention such as repeated readings or Question-Answer-Relationship strategy would be  implemented.  Once the student shows gains through progress monitoring and has improved on the specific skill, the Tier 2 intervention  stops. But if a student continues to show no gains during the Tier 2 intervention, the SIT Team then will discussed possible  alternatives, which could include a Tier 3 referral to Special Education if it is determined that the student has received an  adequate opportunity to be able to succeed.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   For the Freestanding ENL Program, students are heterogeneously grouped and they are taught by the ENL  teacher.  Students travel from their homeroom as a group to the ENL classroom. Entering and Emerging students in  grades K-5 are scheduled to receive two units of study (360 minutes of instruction) per week while students in the  Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding Proficiency levels are scheduled to receive 1 unit of study (180 minutes)  per week. Students participate in a Stand alone program.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      PS 197 has one Dual Language class in the following grades: K, 1, 2, 3, and 4. During small group instruction, students  are grouped based on levels of proficiency. Students are instructed by their Dual Language teacher who is fluent in  both languages (English and Spanish).         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   For all students who are performing in the Entering and Emerging Levels, the school provides 2 periods of ENL per day, which  is 90 minutes per day and 360 minutes per week. Students who are performing in the Transitioning and Expanding Proficiency  Levels  receive 1 unit of study per week for 180 minutes total. Students in the commanding level are entitled to a .5 unit of   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          97      study. These students who achieved the Proficient level on the NYSESLAT in the previous school year will be offered 90  minutes of study per week. All students who are in grades 3-5 and performed on the commanding level will be provided with  testing accommodations for two years and will also be offered the use of a translated version for the MATH Test and Science  Test (Grade 4 Only).       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All students who are identified as English Language Learners (ELLs) and are at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding  and or Commanding levels  have access and equity to all of the content taught on their grades and to the same general  curriculum as their non-ELL peers in the classroom.   P.S. 197Q's Dual Language Program offers a rollercoaster model. With this model, Spanish is taught solely on one day and  English is taught solely on the next day. Teachers provide instruction through the use of various strategies and skills such as:   During common planning teachers in the Dual Language program develop lesson plans in Science, Social Studies, and Math  aligned to the CCLS and with the appropriate differentiation and scaffolding to support students language acquisition. During  instruction, teachers modify and scaffold instruction to ensure that all students acquire the target language and master the  grade-level content.     The ENL teacher plans lessons with the support of the classroom teachers as well as the content teachers in order to  effectively support the development of language and academic learning. Lessons are taught using the Sheltered Instruction  Observation Protocol (SIOP) model.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Dual Language Teachers in grades K-5 assess students throughout the school year. Teachers in grades K-2 used the  Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) in 2017-2018 and will utilize the Foutas & Pinnell (F&P) Reading Assessment in  2018-2019. Teachers in grades 3-5, teachers use Performance Series and continue to use the DRA assessment in Spanish.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Students receive TIER I and TIER II interventions to support the language. Lessons are tailored based on students' needs. All  students participate for two periods a week with the i-Ready online program. One period is devoted to ELA and the other  period is for Math. In addition, all students are invited to attend the Saturday (3-5) and After-School (K-5)  Academies.  Instruction is differentiated as they participate in small groups. Lessons are modified, visual aides such as  charts,  graphic organizers and sentence starters are utilized to support students' needs.  Peer and "buddy" collaboration is utilized  with students fluent in both languages for students learning the new language.    a. SIFE students receive support in their native language.   b/c. Newcomers, developing and transitioning students use the Imagine Learning online program to support the development  of decoding and encoding skills. This program supports students' listening, reading and writing skills. In addition,  teachers use  Fundations, a phonics-based research program which supports student decoding , fluency, vocabulary and reading and writing  skills. Students participate in a 40 minute lesson five days a week. Teachers are trainned in Fundations. ELLs who have been in  the U.S. for less than three years (newcomers) are placed in the program chosen by the parent. The groups are differentiated  according to proficiency levels and are taught by teachers certified within their respective fields (ENL, Classroom and Dual  Language).   d.  Long Term ELLs will receive mandated periods as per NY State Law.  In order to continue supporting students acquisition of  the language,  they use the online programs such as  Imagine Learning and i-Ready for both ELA and Math as well as National  Geographic materials.  Students participate in the After School (K-5) and  Saturday Academies (3-5).   Teachers who work with Long Term English Language Learners (ELLs), ensure that students have the appropriate support and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          98      services to meet their needs.  Response to Intervention (RTI) Tier II  will be provided to ELLs with IEPs.  e. Former English Language Learners will receive a 0 .5 unit of study (90 minutes) as per NY State law. Students will be  provided with instruction from a licensed teacher for two years after achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT. They will also  receive appropriate testing accommodations for two years after achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT assessment.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers in grades K-5 teach literacy through the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. Teachers in grades K-5 use the  Go Math curriculum which can be taught in both English and Spanish.  ENL students are instructed with Words Their Way for  phonics and RIGOR for reading and writing.  During lesson planning teachers create lessons targeted to address students'  needs.   Teachers scaffold lessons to support students in the process of the new language and content learning.  The scaffolding  support enables students to accomplish given tasks. In addition,  the scaffolding strategies utilized by teachers allow students  to develop new concepts, improve  their knowledge and achieve skills for the acquisition of the new language required to  support their own work. In terms of educational materials, scaffold lessons need to be meaningful and understandable so they  will promote a student's autonomy over time.  Teachers provide students with ample opportunities to engage and share their  novel ideas.  In addition, the online program Imagine Learning is being integrated in the teacher's daily schedule for  individualized learning. Students in grades K-5 participate from two to four periods per week based on the student's needs.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  While the curriculum being taught is the same for both ENL and general and special education students, teachers will modify  and scaffold the content for ENL students with IEPs based on the student's needs. The ENL teacher, together with the  classroom teacher will plan lessons based on students' IEP academic goals, management needs and accommodations.  Flexible scheduling is always a priority. As a school the goal is for the scholars to move from the most restrictive to the Least  Restrictive Environment. (LRE). The School supports teachers with Professional Development and resources in order to support  student academic levels of performance and be able to participate in the general education curriculum at all times.    The homeroom teacher and the SIT team at PS 197   will analyze student data  for those who are receiving services in a self  contain class. The data will help to determine whether or not the student can benefit from a flexible. During the IEP meeting  the classroom teacher and the team will analyze and make the final decision on moving students from the most restrictive  to a  LRE for any of the content areas in which the student shows growth. The student will be scheduled to participate in a flexible  program for the areas in which he or she is growing as per teacher's data.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS 197 will support all level 1 students through Tier II RTI in cycles of 6-8 weeks to support the development of the ELA and  MATH content.  All students in grades 3-5 are invited to participate in our After-School and Saturday Academies to foster their  reading, math,  and other core content areas.  For students who speak Spanish they will be provided services with a  bilingual  teacher. Students in grades K-2 are also invited to participate in the After School Academy. If students do not make  any progress they will be supported with Tier II RTI services. In addition, teachers in Dual Language classes provide RTI to their  ELL students in groups with no more than 6 students.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on our school data The Ocean School will continue with the Dual Language Program for grades K-4,  and the  Freestanding New Language for grades K-5.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          99      N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students in grades K-5 were invited to participate in our After-School Academy and students in grades 3-5 were invited to  attend our Saturday Academy as well.. During the After-School Academy, students in grades K-5 attended two days per week  for a 90 minute block. Students in grades 3-5 the Saturday Academy from 9:00 am - 12:30 pm.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  TCRWP, Go math, and Passport for Social Studies are utilized during the school day and Amplify Science will be utilized in 2018- 2019. Supplementary resources and online programs such as Imagine Learning will be utilized for students to develop the  second language. iReady will be utilized for ELA and Math. Other online resources include My On (reading) as well as Go Math  will be used to support our scholars in the school and at home.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided in our Dual Language classroom. The Dual Language teacher provides the appropriate  language support for his or her students. Dual Language teachers are certified in that area and fluently speak both English and  Spanish. Students will receive instruction in the child's home language.  Students in Dual Language classes have will have  classroom libraries that contain books in Spanish. ENL students are supported through the use of dictionaries in their native  language.  Students have access to translated versions of examinations for Math and Science tests, as well as Passport Social  Studies.  Teachers use authentic materials from a variety of countries to make learning more meaningful and diverse as well.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   At the beginning of the school year, The ENL/Dual Language Coordinator reviews student information and ensures that  students in dual language programs and in the freestanding ENL program are placed  during the first 10 days of school in the  appropriate program  as required by New York State Law. Subjects including Math, Reading, Writing, Science and Social Studies  will be taught in both Spanish and English. In addition, as per CR Part 154 students are provided with the minimum number  minutes for stand alone or Integrated ENL. The mandated minutes are based on students proficiency levels.  Students can  participate in a Stand Alone or in an Integrated ENL/ELA classroom with the appropriate resources that correspond to the ENL  student's age and grade level. Our ENLs are provided equity of content and curriculum at each grade level.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All newly enrolled ELLs are provided with support from a team that includes the Guidance Counselor the ENL/Dual Language  Coordinator, ENL teacher, administration and the classroom teacher.  The Dual Language teacher or the classroom teacher  work with his or her students and provides the student with a peer or “buddy." The buddy is a student that speaks the child’s  native language as well as English. He or she helps the ENL student become acclimated to the school and can take the role as a  translator for the student as well.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          100         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   P.S. 197  uses the rollercoaster model. In this model, students are instructed in each language on an  alternate day. One day the instruction will be in Spanish; the next day the instruction will be in English.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided for Dual Language and ENL teachers by a Dual Language consultant, ENL coordinator  with support from the administration. This professional development will be conducted in both as a team and individually and  is in addition to any Professional Development provided to all teachers and instructional leaders.     The consultant and coordinator work in conjunction to assist ENL and Dual Language teachers in scaffolding of lessons to meet  the needs of the ENL population. In addition, the ENL coordinator and members of the LAP Team will provide teachers who are  serving ELLs with professional development sessions during common planning meetings and After-School PD with strategies on  how to make the Common Core Learning Standards accessible to ELLs. All dual language teachers and ENL providers will  participate in these sessions.    During summer time teachers participated in a four day PD session conducted by Dr. Buttaro, our Dual Language consultant.  Here, they analyzed the new levels of performance, strategies that can be utilized for newcomers, entering or emerging  students. During the month of June,  Dual Language teachers and the ENL coordinator met to develop a pacing calendar to  identify and plan thematic units that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. These units will be  implemented in  order to enhance students' acquisition of the content.     As teachers review the standards, they are able to create lessons that offers students opportunities to engage in oral  and written conversations; offer students situations where they can explain and justify their thoughts and finally make  conclusions based on given tasks. The revision of the Standards provides teachers with opportunities to develop appropriate  lessons which will support and engage students in daily lessons.     During the school year 2017-2018 all teachers  in dual language classes and in the ENL program participated in a series of  internal and external workshops.  Since students levels of proficiency are different, teachers are provided with tools on how  lessons can be modified, scaffolded and aligned to the common core standards across the content areas.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  During the school year, our school Guidance Counselor attends workshops that focus specifically on students transitioning to  middle school. The strategies learned during the workshops are shared with staff members during staff professional  development and common planning meetings.     All new teachers, ENL teachers, and special education teachers, will receive at least 7.5 hours of ELL training during the 2018- 2019 school year. The ENL  coordinator and the members of the LAP Team will turn-key of the strategies acquired during  professional development sessions.   These professional development hours will be accomplished during teacher common   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          101         planning meetings or during Lunch and Learn sessions. The objective of the Professional Development sessions will be the  integration of language development in content area instruction and the scaffolding of the CCLS aligned instruction for the DNL  students. Teachers will participate at monthly meetings outside the building provided by the BSFC and or the DELLs office.     Once a week for a 45 minute period Dual Language teachers and ENL providers meet with the Assistant Principal, the ENL  Coordinator and the outside consultant to discuss and learn strategies as well as address any mandates and compliance  needs.   Professional Development agendas, sign-in sheets and materials for each of these sessions will be maintained by the Dual  Language/ENL coordinator, Assistant Principal and teaching staff.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 197, The Ocean School's vision is to maintain and build  strong communication with parents. The school believes that parent  involvement is crucial. When parents are closely in their children's education, students become aware and as a result can  perform more productively. Another result in ongoing and productive parent involvement can be in positive student behavior.  With parents demonstrating ongoing support and interest in their child's education, students can see that both parents and  the school staff are working together This could result in students showing increased interest in school activities which can  help lead them to becoming successful learners.    At all times, PS 197 aims to engage parents in school  activities with opportunities that include parent workshops and family  activities and events. The overarching goal is to create a strong partnership with parents. This is where our Parent-Teachers  Association, Community Based-Organization, School Staff and School administration work closely to make these opportunites  available for all families. This can include volunteering for events and ongoing activities as well as participation in classroom  celebrations and informative meetings. Parents are invited to meet with the principal as well where they can be able to bring  any issues that they may have. This can during special events such as an attendance breakfast, parent workshops or monthly  P.T.A. meeting.     At the beginning of the school year, parents are invited to analyze student NYSESLAT results and teachers can explain how the  scores determine the levels of student performance. Here, teachers share with parents other Summative Assessments that are  both informative and relevant to a student's instructional growth. This is a way to indicate to parents the needs of the student  and how the school can support students' language development. Parents are made aware that students are provided with  resources and supports  such as After-School and Saturday Academies in order to  support student language development.   In addition to the initial parent orientation or Parent-Teacher-Conferences, parents or guardians of ENL students are invited  once a year to discuss the goals of the ENL program, the curriculum students are using, the progress of students' language  development, the various diagnostic and formative  classroom assessments as well as language development needs  in all  content areas.    During all meetings teachers meet with parents to explain the needs for their children; areas that required student growth and  how together the school and the parents can support their children.  For children who are in Dual Language classes, the  teacher will communicate with parents in the child's home language. For students who receive ENL services, a bilingual teacher  who speaks the language will assist the parents during the meeting. In other cases , the Translation and Interpretation Unit will  be contacted. In addition, parents are made aware that if they need any document related to school, the school will be able to  translate for them. In a situation where the school cannot provide a translator for a specific language, the Department of  Education's Interpretation and Translation Unit will be used to provide parents with the necessary information in their native  language.     Potential workshops held throughout the school year as prepared and implemented by our Guidance Counselor, Parent  Coordinator, Administration and ENL/Dual Language Coordinator:  Ongoing Resources provided to our families include:        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          102         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parent Coordinator is available for parental and family contact at all times.  Parents are invited to participate in monthly  workshops as well as  specific open houses and events. Communication of these events occur through translated back-packed  letters and monthly calendars. Translators can be made available for all parents and families during specific meetings and  workshops.  Workshops  are meant to be inclusive and not make a parent of an ELL feel isolated. Topics of workshops can be  specifically for ELL parents; however they can be relevant for all families as well. P.S. 197Q ensures that regardless of the topic  all parents feel welcomed and are supported. With that, as mentioned above and reemphasized, ELL parents will be supported  with translated materials and interpreters. During Open Houses and workshops, teachers share with parents information  about the grade curriculum, activities, ELL services, and Internet sites that students may be able to visit when they are  home.  Translation services for parents can include Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, Korean and Urdu. If a parent speaks  another language,  the Parent Coordinator and/or the ENL Coordinator contact the Unit Translation Service and Interpretation  for further support and assistance.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    P.S. 197Q is proud of its all-inclusive community. We are fortunate that many staff members speak other languages including  Spanish and Haitian Creole. Those staff members that are mono-lingual reach out to multilingual staff members for assistance.  With the support and clear vision of the principal, P.S. 197Q has instrumental resources such as a Dual Language Consultant and  ENL Coordinator who work closely with the teachers in both teams and individually ensuring that the latest strategies are learned  and taught and that ENL and Dual Language students are receiving the same quality education as any student would. ENL students  are not isolated at P.S. 197Q We are a community of learners who respect each other cultures and love to learn and share their  backgrounds.                          2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          103   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christina Villavicencio, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          104                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Ocean School                                                                              School DBN: 27Q197  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to determine the translation and oral interpretation at PS 197, we use the following indicators: Home  Language Indicators on ATS; parent surveys and parent conversations to determine translation and oral  interpretation needs. We provide information on parent communication needs for the school Language Allocation  Plan. The parent team and the ENL coordinator confer with the parents by telephone and in one-to-one  conferences to identify parents' individual communication needs.            2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          106     2.
