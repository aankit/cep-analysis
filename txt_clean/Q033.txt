This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to enable all of our children to become lifelong, independent learners who are active participants in  their own education, growth and development and who are engaged and challenged to become critical thinkers  who can work both individually and cooperatively as problem solvers. Our instructional focus is to have students  write for a variety of purposes and audiences with sophistication and complexity appropriate to the grade level.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 33 strives to create an enriching and nurturing environment in which all students can flourish and achieve at their  highest educational level possible. Through direct, individualized instruction, students become lifelong, independent  learners who actively participate in their education.    PS 33 is committed to providing an active, hands-on approach to the teaching of Science and Technology. There are  two labs, which merge components of science, mathematics and technology into daily instruction. It is a structured  STEM approach permitting research, response to questions and recording information through a practical task-based  and computer-based format. Children learn a variety of skills including coding, data collection and implementation,  publishing and Internet use. The school also has an award winning web site. Parents can use it to find school and class  materials besides general information.   PS 33 is a community-based school in the truest sense of the word. Partnerships with SNAP, The Cross Island YMCA  and the NYPD serve to solidify the bond between the community and school thus leading to a tight-knit school  culture. Students are exposed to a variety of community service opportunities such as The Penny Harvest and The St.  Jude’s Math-A-Thon. Through these service opportunities, students learn the importance of community and empathy.  These partnerships have led to increased student engagement and a decrease in student disciplinary infractions.    PS33 is entering its 4th year of a partnership with Arts Connection, a program designed to provide visual arts  instruction to students across the grades. The program introduces various mediums and methods to students,  culminating in several performances for the school community.    We have partnered with the national organization, Reading Partners, to offer our students a 1:1 tutorial program in  reading comprehension. The program addresses our need for academic intervention in 1st and 2nd grade. As a result  of the work Reading Partners has done with our students, 90% of the participants have made at least 1 year of  progress over the course of 6 months within program.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Nestled in the diverse neighborhood of Queens Village N.Y., PS 33 serves 1,053 students in grades K-5. Our diverse  student body and high level of staff experience are the keystones of PS 33 success. The student demographic  breakdown is as follows: 47% Asian, 27% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 5% White. Of those students, 12% are English  Language Learners and 12% are Students with Special Needs. Those special student populations require a more  individualized model of instruction. Small group work is built in to the daily lessons of every classroom to ensure that  students with disabilities and English language learners receive targeted assistance. Daily programs have been created  with the needs of this student population in mind.                4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the 2016-2017 Framework for Great Schools, PS 33 is excelling in the areas of Effective School  Leadership, Trust, Rigorous Instruction and Collaborative Teachers. 42% of our student body in grades 3-5 is  exceeding their target in performance on the ELA State Test. On the Math State Test, 40% of students are exceeding  target levels. These figures show improvement over previous years and illustrate the effectiveness of instruction and  preparation that exists at PS 33. While those numbers are encouraging, there still exists a need for improvement in  the areas of Student Achievement and Strong Family-Community Ties according to the 2016-2017 Framework for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Great Schools. Our goals for the upcoming year will be to increase student achievement and improve community ties  through a variety of actions.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q033   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   974   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Formal and informal observations revealed that students had difficulty articulating their next steps for improvement.  According to the most recent Framework for Great Schools survey, there needs to be a greater press toward academic  achievement on the part of the students. That begins with the student/ teacher relationship in the classroom.  Research has shown that students who receive targeted and specific feedback, feel supported and challenged by their  teachers. Teachers must offer all students useful, student-friendly advice after the administration of assessments.  Feedback must be goal-oriented, tangible, timely, and consistent in order to develop student independence. Teachers  who adjust their instruction based on student performance and provide their students with descriptive feedback,  achieve positive results. Our students need tangible and specific goals in order to maximize their education.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In order to better meet the needs of our staff, a comprehensive professional development program needs to be  implemented. According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, PS 33 scores high in the section “Effective School  Leadership”. This is illustrative of the trust that exists within the professional community and a strong signifier of the  current culture of learning and collaboration within PS 33. However, in the area of “Student Achievement” within the  sub-category of State Math Test Improvement, scores are approaching target. This is a clear area in need of  improvement. It is crucial that we provide remediation, not only to the student body, but to the staff as well in order  to exceed our targets for both Math and ELA achievement on the upcoming state tests.   Based on the most current student data, needs will be assessed and addressed through a yearlong series of  professional development.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 33Q, in compliance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 33Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 33Q, in compliance with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, is implementing a School-Parent Compact  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and  parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how  parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on  assessments.

On the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT we had approximately 20 % of students reach  commanding and an additional 30% of students made progress.   P.S. 33’s Title III program  provides English Language Learning with supplemental instruction in a Saturday program.  The  instructional program will service 30-45 ELLs in grades 1-5 who scored at entering, emerging,  transitioning and expanding levels.  Our rationale for this program is so that the students will  receive additional instruction and strategies to excel in all subject areas.                   The Saturday program specifically addresses instruction in English to improve literacy and  math performance.   It will meet for a total of 3 hours,  once a week.   This program will  begin January and conclude in April. This program will service approximately 10-15 students in  five classes with five fully certified teachers and one supervisor.    Instruction will be provided in  English to help students meet the standards in ELA and Mathematics.   Instruction will focus on  literacy using ELL strategies and methodologies to help students achieve higher scores on  the  State Assessments.       Teachers will use ongoing assessment through small group instruction to gauge the student  progress. Supplementary materials will be provided to augment a variety of instruction.  Among  those are Reading Keys, Connecting Vocabulary and Getting Ready for the ELL and State  exams.  General instructional supplies such as notebooks, folders, pencils, chart tablets will be  purchased to support the Saturday program.   The teacher will keep attendance records.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At P.S. 33 the ELL students are fully integrated within the school population. In the lower grades, the WRAP program, and  MOSL(measure of student learning) are used as assessment tools. The upper grades utilize Treasures for assessment. Based on  these results, the classroom teachers communicate with the ENL teachers to create diversified instruction in the classroom.  Fountas and Pinnell benchmarks are also used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs.  These assessments are ongoing  throughout the school year. The data from these early assessments mirror the results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.   In  speaking modalities 60% of students score at or above grade level.  35%-40% of our students score at or above grade level in  the Reading and Writing portions of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         ENL teachers meet regularly with classroom teachers to discuss and plan for our ELLs based on the ongoing  assessments.  ELLs are supported with leveled libraries and scaffolded lessons to keep them aligned with rigorous standards  based instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  After examining unit exams, benchmark assessments and NYSESLAT scores, we notice progress in our ELL's language  acquisition in areas of listening and speaking. In the reading and writing modalities, our ELLs have shown need for  improvement. The classroom teacher observes growing confidence in the children who receive ENL.  We evaluate the success  of our ENL program for our ELL's based on the progress shown throughout the school year via assessment tools used in the  school (e.g. Fountas and Pinnell, Treasures, NYSESLAT, ELA). Student progress is pertinent in our decision making when  deciding on an ELL program that is successful for our school.  Over the past five years, ELLs have consistently met AYP.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once an ELL is identified as needing an intervention, the ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to support this  ELL as well as suggesting an afterschool/Saturday ENL program for that student.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    The school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention Framework in the following ways:  a)     ELL After school Program  b)     Reading Partners  Tier 1 school wide instructional practices - ELA state test data for upper grades. MOSL for all grades  Teacher created assessments to screen for at risk kids.  Tier 2 Saturday ELL program  small group intervention w/in the ELL classroom.    Tier 3 Create individual lessons according to the students' capabilities using the scaffolding method.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Overall, some of our ELLs performed higher than other ELLs district wide. Based on these results, we maintain rigorous  instruction for our ELLs aligned with the Common Core Standards.  Data patterns reveal that ELL students progress at a faster  pace in the listening and speaking modalities. This can be seen across all grades. The data patterns though, in the reading and  writing modalities indicate that this is the weakest area to achieve in language acquisition. These modalities are acquired at a  slower rate across all grades.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our focus at P.S. 33 is to provide ELLs with the scaffolding tools to successfully meet the grade level CCLS in reading and  writing. Instruction for our ELLs is individualized based on these findings.  In addition to CCLS based instruction, our ENL  teachers use online resources such as Imagine Learning which is tailored to individual student needs.  Our ENL teachers work  closely with the classroom teachers and support the ELLs on the same grade level texts and writing to ensure their language  proficiency.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       At P.S. 33, ENL instruction is delivered via pull-out and push-in organizational models.  Non-English speaking Entering  and Emerging ELLs are pulled out in age/grade-appropriate groupings for the mandated 360 minutes per week of  instruction. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are pulled out in age/grade-appropriate groupings for the mandated  180 minutes per week of instruction. Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or content area, or  other approved services.  ENL and classroom teachers meet on a regular basis in order to align curriculum and  instruction to maintain school-wide consistency of focus.  The push-in model is implemented where possible in  classrooms that are conducive to such with high concentrations of ELLs.  We recognize that push-in has become the  primary model within New York City, and we continue our efforts to implement the model into more of our  classrooms.  In fact, P.S. 33 has continued a program wherein one primary class consists of students, including ELLs,  who benefit from instruction and strategies designed to aid in language acquisition.   The basic program model at P.S. 33 tends to be homogeneous since we group our students according to grade and  proficiency level.  However, during integrated ENL instruction, by nature, we deal with heterogeneous groups as the  student population in any given classroom tends to be mixed.   The integrated model builds English language skills by  a certified ENL teacher through content area in a co-teaching model.  The stand alone ENL model develops  English  language skills by a certified ENL teacher.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              ENL instruction is delivered by certified ENL teachers in the pull-out and push-in models.  Small groups of ELLs  arranged  homogeneously receive instruction in the four modalities based on the mandated number of instructional minutes  required by CR Part 154.  In fact, ENL instruction schedules are created solely based on the mandated number of instructional  minutes in order to comply with Federal, State and Local requirements.  ENL instruction is delivered in our school’s English as a Second Language program according to mandated instructional minutes  for each proficiency level.  ELA instruction is delivered by certified Elementary Education classroom teachers who schedule  Reader’s and Writer’s Workshop periods daily.  Mandated minutes of ELA instruction for ELLs are exceeded by classroom  teachers on a weekly basis.  Our program model does not include NLA instruction.    Entering/Emerging - 360 minutes of instruction per week.  Transitional/Expanding - 180 minutes of instruction per  week.  Commanding -90 minutes of instruction per week.  Units of study includes scaffolding techniques such as;  *organize words on T charts  *analyze the meaning and impact of word choices for content areas  *each grade level unit of study - determine figurative and connotative meanings of words and phrases  *analyze meaning and tone of specific word choices  Entering and Emerging students receive .5 unit of study in the Stand-Alone Program (90 minutes), 1 unit of study in the  Integrated Program (180 minutes) and .5 units of study in Integrated ENL content area (90 minutes), this is on a weekly basis.  Transitioning students receive .5 unit of study in the Integrated Program (90 Minutes) and .5 unit of study in Integrated ENL  content area (90 min) on a weekly basis.  Expanding students receive 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA in the Integrated Program (180  minutes) on a weekly basis.  Commanding students receive .5 unit of study (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ELA on a weekly  basis.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      ENL teachers access monthly grade-level curriculum mapping in order to align ENL instruction with general curriculum.  ENL  and classroom teachers confer on a regular basis to ensure alignment of content area instruction in order to maintain school- wide consistency of focus to support ELLs throughout the school.  ENL methodologies, such as scaffolding, text deconstruction,  and other strategies learned during professional development, are employed in order to promote and support learning in the  content areas while enriching language development at the same time.     Materials: all leveled ENL readers as part of the Treasures Program used in our school,  also alphabet charts, vowel charts,  audio /video, smartboard created lessons, T charts, story maps, word wheels, picture vocabulary cards, cloze texts.  Scaffolding vocabulary instruction, TPR, Realia, Bilingual dictionaries/smart board lessons/Google translator are used to  identify words in native language and translated to English.  Use of CCLS, ENL teacher provides support by using students prior  knowledge, experienced skills while being responsive to student's cultural and linguistic backgrounds.  They are aligned based  on content area subjects along with student abilities. Newcomers use computer instructional programs such as MyOn,  Pearson, Starfall.  These programs have pictures, letter recognition, words, stories, etc. that supports new ELLs with language  development.  Students also have access to IPads.    In the Stand-Alone Model we utilize materials and gather resources that make content more comprehensible and that meet  the demands of the CCLS.  Entering and Emerging students in this model receive and work with a variety of materials, ranging  from Realia to scaffolding techniques needed at this level.  In the Integrated Model, we identify and use basic reading and  writing strategies to make the text/content more comprehensible and meaningful.  We gather, organize, and discuss  information from various sources.  We select materials/information appropriate for the purpose of content.  We  compare/contrast to gain a deeper understanding of language and information.  We use charts, visuals, audios, to present  information clearly and deepen language development.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      After Ell students are identified the PPT and SBST teams forward the request for proper language evaluations.   We also use  native language assessments in Math/Science for NYS assessments and when appropriate/available for unit assessments.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Once a SIFE is identified, P.S. 33 protocol is to make available all existing support structures that might benefit the student  such as Extended Day, Resource Room, Speech and/or Tutorial Periods.  Especially for upper-grade SIFEs, ENL teachers share  instructional techniques and resources with classroom teachers in order to support students at appropriate levels.   All ELLs receive mandated ENL instruction as per CR Part 154 regulations.  Newcomers who arrive in grades 3-5 are encouraged  to take advantage of P.S. 33’s Title III After school Program which provides additional support for our ELLs as they prepare to  participate in NYS assessments (i.e. ELA, Math and Science).  Some test-taking techniques and strategies are included in the  overall instructional delivery of our program, however, since test-taking is not a generic part of language acquisition, our  program does not focus unduly on it.  At P.S. 33, a buddy system is in place in order to provide newly-arrived ELLs with more  English-proficient fellow native speakers as buddies.  This helps lower the affective filter for language acquisition.  In addition,  bilingual picture dictionaries and dual language glossaries are in place to help support new learning.  A very small number of P.S. 33’s ELLs are receiving services beyond four years.  Of these, half are students receiving Academic  Intervention Services.  Our plan for these students includes mandated Extended Day and Related Services as required by their  individual academic needs and IEPs where applicable.  At P.S. 33 there are no students who have completed 6 years of ENL instruction.  We continue to monitor our population and  plan for their distinct needs as individual situations arise.  P.S. 33 students with special needs (e.g., cognitive and physical special needs, medically fragile students, etc.) who are  identified as ELLs are included in the mainstream ENL program based on collaborative judgment between ENL teachers and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      our school’s Health Coordinator.  ENL strategies and instructional methods are utilized in order to maximize the educational  benefit to these children based on their individual learning needs.   Former ELLs are provided 90 minutes of mandated ENL services.  Test accommodations are provided for ELLs and former ELLs  as per IEP.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWD use grade level materials to ensure the academic progress of the students.  the teachers use the ELL  component of the Treasures Literacy Curriculum.  This component provides the students with support of the academic content  covered in the classroom.  Teachers modify specific lessons to accelerate English language development.  In addition, teachers  provide the following strategies to excel the students' academic progress and English language development: scaffolding,  modeling, TPR, and Realia.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers confer a regular basis to ensure alignment of content area  instruction in order to promote and support learning in the content areas while enriching language development.  We utilize a variety of instructional strategies and materials that provide access to academic content areas and accelerate  English language development.  The use of Realia and TPR are used abundantly.  For Entering and Emerging students, the use  of manipulatives, drawings, charts, graphic organizers, word wheels, and visual aids are highly used. For Transitioning and  Expanding students , the use of timelines, newspapers, manipulatives, charts, and audios are highly used.  We are currently in the process of launching the Imagine Learning Online Reading Program tailored to the needs of our  ELLs based on individual baseline assessments. We use a lot of technology such as, computer programs, AcTivPanel  smartboard programs, IPADs, listening audios for academic content. A variety of books in different native languages are used,  dictionaries on a variety of languages, and videos/audios are used for native language materials.    A variety of instructional strategies for ELL-SWD's are utilized in our school such as: Use of Comprehensible Input, making  lessons visual, linking new information to prior knowledge, determining key concepts for the units and defining language and  content objects for each lesson, modifying vocabulary, use of cooperating learning strategies,and modifying testing and  homework for ELL-SWD's.  We make sure all ELL-SWD's receive all services mandated on their IEP's.  All staff members servicing students of this nature  are allowed access to  the IEP and they work together to compose a plan that fits in all mandates for the student along with a  program that meets the mandates.  All of our ELL-SWD's whose IEP mandates ENL instruction receives an appropriate  program.  Staff works together to create a program for the student that fits in all mandated services, while providing any  support to staff or student if necessary.  When we acquire bilingual instruction, we will follow all mandates for the student,  making sure the student receives all services needed.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL department , special education department and administration collaboratively determine a needs assessment for all  ELL - SWD's  to best be served in the least restricted environment.  Staffing and budget are taken into consideration before any  consensus is reached.   The staff works cooperatively to ensure  scheduling flexibility to support ELL-SWDs with IEP goals and  language acquisition.  The staff works together to create models that are unique to each student and focusing on increasing access to the general  education curriculum. All staff involved on this team, examines student data, identifies the strengths and needs of each  student, staff identifies school resources, effectively engage parents, staff amends IEP's and implements new schedule, and a  new schedule is created to meet the students' need.  The criteria used to place ELL-SWD's in ICT classes are as follows:  Classroom Teacher evaluates and refers student, filling out  all necessary forms with consensus from the parent.  SBST evaluates forms and observes student, along with any other  necessary paperwork, staff works cooperatively to evaluate student and any services that student may need, PPT discusses  student and makes a decision, consultation/meeting with the parent about placement takes place.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      P.S. 33’s Title III Afterschool program targets ELA, Math and Science preparation for all ELLs.  ELLs also benefit from our  Afterschool program where they work in small groups with ENL teachers targeting specific areas of need.  Where appropriate  and/or mandated, ELLs attend SETSS sessions tailored to their specific academic needs. Identified students in greater need are  given intervention from our reading teacher. Afterschool programs also target Social Studies content area.  Intervention  services offered in English range form one-on-one to small group instruction.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      P.S. 33 will conduct a program wherein instruction and strategies designed to aid in language acquisition will be provided by a  certified ENL teacher and will provide the mandated time for the Commanding ELLs.  By combining grade level curriculum, the  language expertise of the ENL teacher along with content instruction with a focus in art, the students will develop academic  vocabulary that will be sustained throughout their educational careers and prepare them as lifelong learners. We are also  implementing an online reading program targeted for ELLs.  Imagine Learning is a program designed to individualize instruction  based on individual benchmark assessments.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  At P.S. 33, ELLs are included in all before-, during- and after-school activities, and are encouraged to participate in all  appropriate school community activities, clubs, teams, etc.  A Title III program will be offered to ELL students to participate on  a pre-fixed amount of Saturdays for academic intervention.  School Programs are as follows:  Reading Partners, Afterschool  programs in ELA and content areas, Extracurricular after school activities, and Saturday Programs.  School encourages and  invites ELL's to participate in such programs by sending home letters to parents, phone calls with translation in native  languages if necessary, and meetings/workshops inviting parents to learn about each program and encouraging them to have  the student participate. Our ELL's are encouraged by all staff to participate in any programs/services offered.  ELL's are present  in all of the programs and services offered at our school.  They attend all services/programs that can fit into their  schedule.  They also attend after-school and Saturday programs.  ELL's have priority on all of our programs and if any services  are needed they also have priority.  For each program, 30% of the students enrolled are ELL's.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Materials used to aid instruction of ELLs include realia; picture and photo cards; manipulatives; Reader’s Theater; various trade  books in English and native languages; and  leveled readers.  Imagine Learning software is fully implemented for all ELLs in  upper grades.  In addition, computers and computer learning software is utilized in small-group ENL instruction.  Classroom  teachers are also encouraged to allow ELLs time on classroom computers visiting language learning sites such as Imagine  Learning, MyOn, Treasures, Pearson,  www.esl-kids.com, www.everythingESL.net, www.starfall.com, and other appropriate  educational websites previewed by ENL teachers.  Materials used for subgroups are: manipulatives, videos, charts, graphic  organizers,  materials in native langauge,  and technology programs.  Native language materials include: levelled readers on  different levels, dictionaries with different languages, illustrations and graphs with native languages needed, videos/audios  with native languages.  Content area materials range from manipulatives and number lines to diagrams and tables.  In addition,  newspapers, videos,  and graphic organizers are used.  Technology used are laptops ,tablets, IPADs, ActivPanel resources and  programs, and computer programs.  Visuals are displayed on our technology resources for visuals for ELL's.  Stories are  displayed on the ActivPanel for ELL's.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Bilingual picture dictionaries in our community’s major home languages are available to all ELLs.  Children are always  encouraged to bring native language materials to school to share with teachers and classmates, and to aid in the transitional  period of adjustment they experience as newcomers.  Bilingual staff are on hand to support students and their families.  In  addition, ENL teachers encourage ELL families to maintain the use of their L1 at home in order to promote literacy skills that  transfer from the native language to English.  Our ENL program includes numerous literary resources in native languages such   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      as: levelled readers and dictionaries, along with audios and visuals through technology.  We also utilize our bilingual staff for  any translation of materials as needed.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required supports and resources correspond to students in the ELL program in regards to their appropriate age and grade  level.  Staff servicing students are licensed in the grade levels they are responsible for.  Resources are researched and bought  for specific grade levels.  Other resources used are categorized and organized according to age and grade level.  The three ENL  teachers service specific grades and follow the ELL component of the curriculum for that age/grade level.  Grade/Age  appropriate materials are used that are aligned with the CCLS and curriculum.  In addition, other service providers are  experienced and licensed in the grade/age level they are required to be servicing.    Services and Resources are adapted for ELL-SWD's to correspond to their age and grade levels, while being appropriate to their  cognitive needs.  Staff providing services modify instruction for these students and utilize resources age/grade  appropriate.  Resources are also modified to meet the needs of ELL-SWD's.  Curriculum and instruction are also scaffolded  taking into account the cognitive needs of these students.  Comprehensible Input, linking new information to prior knowledge,  modifying vocabulary and testing, determining key concepts while defining language and content objectives for instruction are  some strategies we use to adapt to the needs of ELL-SWD's while being appropriate to their cognitive needs.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Parents and students are encouraged to visit the school prior to the new school year, starting in September.  The building and  program supervisor are available throughout the summer.   The Principal and Parent Coordinator are available for any  assistance and/or activities and workshops.  The ENL teachers and guidance counselor are available during the school year for  any assistance or activities and workshops planned.  Newly enrolled ELLs are provided with a packet of activities.  These  activities are grade/age appropriate for each student.  Activities in packets range from, alphabet charts to tables and  charts.  Workshops are held for these students and their parents prior to the beginning of the school year to assist in making  an easy transition into the school setting.  Furthermore, the workshops are designed to help ELLs prepare for the upcoming  school year by giving them opportunities to participate in pairs/partners grouping, small group work and familiarizing them  with the structure of their new school setting.   New ELLs that enroll throughout the school year are also provided with packets and workshops to help with their transition  into their new school setting.  Since they enroll when the school year is already in progress, the ENL teachers provide a period  of the day/week when needed to work on special activities tailored to the needs of these students.  Activities range from word  wheels and phonics games to how to use manipulatives.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer language electives at this point.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   ENL teachers at P.S. 33 will attend professional development workshops provided by our District. During the 2017-18 school  year, ENL teachers will provide support and PD to staff members.  ENL teachers meet informally with classroom teachers to  discuss strategies to use with ELLs throughout the day.  ENL teachers will plan, model, and co-teach lessons with teachers.  Our  ELL Network Support Specialist will continue to share strategies and support the teacher of this class.  The language acquisition  classroom teacher will attend workshops, when available, over the course of the year, September, 2017 - June 2018. The  principal and the ENL teachers participated in a year-long study group supporting ELL instruction and language acquisition last  year to support our school-wide commitment to supporting ELLs and the staff members providing services for them.  This  instructional support will continue for the 2017-18 school year.  During faculty conferences, grade team conferences and Inquiry Team meetings, ENL teachers cover a variety of issues, such as  identification of ELLs, the ENL program, compliance with Federal, State and Local requirements, and strategies and techniques  that work with ELLs in the acquisition of English and the learning of content area material.    Assistant Principals and ENL teachers provide professional development  for classroom teachers, along with paraprofessionals,  special education teachers, occupational/physical therapists, psychologists, guidance counselors, and speech  therapists.  Parent Coordinators and secretaries are provided professional development opportunities as needed. Workshops  focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Workshops are  also developed on the needs of the school and as per teacher requests.    Current Common Core programs which are implemented in Ps 33Q, Treasures and Envision,  will have numerous Professional  Development sessions conducted by the vendors to all staff with concentrated small group sessions for specific  subjects.  Teachers of ELLs are provided with professional development to give these teachers the opportunities to familiarize  themselves with the CCLS, use the CCLS, how to incorporate it into their lesson plans and everyday activities, different  strategies and instruction that utilize the CCLS. Professional Development help teachers incorporate the CCLS on a daily basis  by providing the CCLS on all content areas.  Websites are also provided in professional development, in order to support  teachers of ELLs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Since fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must be  dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for English language learners, the ENL teachers provide PDs in these areas.  ENL teachers are also required  to deliver a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of  professional development hours dedicated to language acquisition in alignment  with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for English language learners. These PDs are provided to the staff through faculty conferences presented  by certified ENL teachers.   The ENL teachers maintain all documents such as agendas and attendance presented to staff.    At PS 33, ENL teachers conduct professional development training for the school staff on the first Monday of each month  during inquiry period at 2:45pm.  These PD's support classroom teachers in topics that include steps of language acquisition,  explaining the modalilties of the NYSESLAT, and scaffolding lessons necessary to increase movement in proficiency from one  level to the next.    PD's conducted for the entire staff take place on specific Mondays at 2:45 pm, during staff development.  Topics include the  components of Danielson's Framework, which are aligned to support teachers in delivering Common Core  instruction.    Professional Development records are kept by agendas and attendance.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers at PS 33 provide annual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development  progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas during our parent  involvement day on Tuesday afternoons.  The ENL teachers will inform the school parent coordinator if there are any  interpretations and translations needed for the meeting. In addition to Tuesdays, the ENL teachers schedule appointments  during the school day if necessary as well as before and after school hours. Interpreters are present as needed.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The P.S. 33 school community enjoys a high level of parent involvement.  Our school is a welcoming environment for students,  families and visitors.  Our PTA enjoys a large and committed membership who contributes their time and energy to many  projects that benefit our school and school community.  Our Parent Coordinator creates, organizes and facilitates many  opportunities for parent and family involvement in the way of day- and night-time workshops.  Some of the workshops held at  P.S. 33  Open Doors ELL (parents & children workshops), Bullying Prevention, Organizing your Child, Movie Night, and Parent  ESL classes for beginners and advanced learners.  Translation services are provided all year for parents, especially during  activities planned.  School staff such as the parent coordinator, paraprofessionals, and other bilingual staff are available to  translate when needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Vincent Gatto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Edward M Funk                                                                              School DBN: 29Q033  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Using the data recorded in ATS and based on the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey), annual school  reports, blue emergency card indicators, discussions at school leadership meetings and PTA meetings, and daily  parent teacher contact, we assess the school’s need for written translation and oral interpretation. During the  school day, we use staff to translate. In the event we find the need for a translator, we contract outside agencies  to work with us. Interpreters as well as school personnel who are able to translate and interpret are made  available during individual parent-teacher conferences to ensure progress in instruction.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Arabic   Bengali   Chinese   Haitian Creole   Hindi   Malayalam   English   Pilipino   Punjabi   Portuguese   Russian   Spanish   Tamil   Urdu           13   32   3   5   4   2   724   1   27   1   1   67   3   16   1.45   3.56   0.33   0.56   0.44   0.22   80.53   0.11   3   0.11   0.11   7.45   0.33   1.78   13   32   2   6   5   2   722   0   30   1   2   64   3   17   1.45   3.56   0.22   0.67   0.56   0.22   80.31   0   3.34   0.11   0.22   7.12   0.33   1.89   3.

This will allow parents to  understand standardized exams, informal assessments, and to notify parents of individual student progress. All  important documents are provided in translated form. They are distributed from the main office and the parent  coordinator also maintains a file of these documents in her office. Parental notices will be sent in English and other  target languages informing parents of the availability of translation and interpretation services at the school.

At the end of formal/informal meetings with parents, pedagogues and interpreters gather feedback from parents on  the quality and availability of the language access services. Parents who need further clarification/interpretation are  able to schedule appointments to privately discuss the content of the meetings. At PTA and school leadership  meetings, parents and pedagogues gather and discuss feedback from the parents on the quality and use of such  services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61
