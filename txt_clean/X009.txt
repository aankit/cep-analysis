This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 9’s mission is to create technologically literate, socially responsible citizens with the necessary skills to succeed in  middle school in every content area. We endeavor to create a nurturing, safe environment where young minds are  opened to embrace new challenges. This mission along with the Framework for Great Schools, the Chancellor’s School  Diversity Plan: Equity and Excellence for All, the Hallmarks of Advanced Literacy, and Every Student Succeeds Act,  served as the central and focal point in creating this plan as will the goals, strategies and actions within the plan. As a  collaborative learning community, PS9 takes our mission statement to heart and actively finds ways to incorporate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      the aforementioned initiatives, without losing its essence. Our mission statement is the framework or the point of  departure in the process of the development of our Comprehensive Educational Plan.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 9 is an inner city community school, located in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Due to its diverse  demographics, the leadership of the school is in constant exploration of ways to be culturally responsive to the needs  of our learning community. It is for that reason that we actively seek to create opportunities for our students that will  enhance their school and personal experience. One example of this is our ongoing relationship with the Sports and  Arts in Schools Foundation (SASF), that allows us to provide both academic and social support to our students. This  collaboration speaks to our commitment to create and strengthen community relationships, as stipulated in the  Framework for Great Schools Strong-Family Community Ties element. The partnership between PS9 and SASF,  benefits our students in that both organizations unite efforts to carefully select rigorous materials to be used in their  academic portion of the program. This is one way to ensure that our students succeed in literacy, math, sports as well  as socially. Providing the participating students these opportunities align with ESSA and the Hallmarks of Advanced  Literacy, as every child is given the opportunity to continue developing their skills in writing, rich discussions and other  disciplines.    Additionally, we have other ongoing partnerships that support our students. Learning through Expanded Arts (LeAp),  involve professional artists that enhance the core curriculum by fostering creativity and stimulating students’  curiosity. Our partnership with Literacy Inc. (LINC) helps to empower families with the acquisition of the skills and  knowledge necessary to support their children in developing early childhood literacy skills. As their mission states,  LINC believes “individual communities possess the resources and the ability to raise accomplished children.”       To cultivate socially responsible students, we involve our students in charitable activities such as food can drives and  Grandma Carmelita, a program where our students visit the elderly in a nearby nursing home. To raise awareness of  community service, sustainability, and self-sufficiency Ms. Vigilant, our School Librarian, parent volunteers, and  students have established a “Peace Garden.” This garden has given our students and parents an opportunity to  connect with the environment, explore the basics of gardening, learn where food comes from; bringing our Science  curriculum to life, through real-world, hands-on experiences and activities. We also have a Title III project-based Civics  through Literature and the Arts Program, which in addition to supporting our students with their academics and civic  knowledge and responsibilities, helps them develop initiatives to take care of their community with activities such as  the cleaning of the Slattery Park, creating a rock garden with positive messages, and other community-centered  service projects.    Professional learning is always an integral part of our strategic plan to develop our teachers. After having visited, P.S.  359 (Concourse Village Elementary School) a “Thinking Maps” Showcase School, with similar demographics to ours,  we decided to explore the use of “Thinking Maps” in our school. In order to implement the use of “Thinking Maps” in  our school, teachers have received and will continue to receive extensive training on using “Thinking Maps” in all  subject areas. Thinking maps is another way in which we as a school incorporate the Hallmarks of Advanced Literacy.  We are also in the second year of our Peer Support Guided Reading initiative; this is a partnership between teachers  to provide small group skills-based guided reading support in the K-3 classrooms. During Peer Support Guided  Reading, teachers push into each other’s classrooms to support the students through guided reading and small group  instruction. This structure allows teachers the opportunity to work with each other’s students, while the students  benefit from working with a different instructor.    Additionally, our school continues to receive support from the Universal Literacy Reading Coach (ULIT Coach), who  works in concert with our k-2 teachers to help their students develop early literacy skills by improving their practices   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      in areas such as Fundations, lesson planning and instructional strategies. Our ULIT Coach also coordinates interclass  visitations, observes teachers and provides constructive actionable feedback. She also reviews assessments and  provides teachers with strategies and resources to improve student performance.                      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student population is predominantly of Latino and African American descent. We have approximately 840  students, of which 27.1% are English Language Learners and 19.9% are students with disabilities. Both subgroups  experience difficulty with writing, as demonstrated on performance-based tasks and standardized tests. Several of  these students also exhibit social-emotional challenges which makes learning more difficult. This CEP will delineate  the action plan we will put into place to support these students’ various social and academic needs.   Additionally, 25% of our students do not have permanent housing, which interferes with the consistency of their  education; impacting attendance, punctuality, social-emotional wellness, focus and parental involvement. Our goal is  to provide these students with a safe and supportive environment, where they can achieve academically, despite  their struggles and challenges, to advance equity and access for all in accordance with ESSA.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In accordance with the Framework for Great Schools, P.S. 9 continues to make progress in the Collaborative Teachers  element, as teachers work on together improve instructional practice and support student learning. The 2017-18  School Quality Guide Rating was 3.91, whereas our 2016-17 rating was 3.88. Teachers continue the work from the  previous years to plan and conduct interclass visitations and provide each other with feedback. This rating indicates  that our school culture has shifted to an established collaborative school community, where collaboration and  collective responsibility is the norm. Teacher leaders continue to facilitate workshops and meetings through the  various Professional Learning Cycles (PLCs). Through these cycles all teachers participate in collaborative learning,  through interclass visitations, peer coaching, and reciprocal and constructive feedback.   We strongly believe that in order for our student to learn, we must provide them with a supportive and safe  environment. Although, our School Quality Guide Rating for Supportive Environment increased from 2.93 to 3.10 in  2017-18, it is an area we feel we need to focus on. Our action plan will indicate how we plan to support our students  towards meeting high expectations and providing a positive learning environment that will allow them to learn.   Our goal is to also improve our family-community ties and improve trust, by creating a bridge between community  resources and our families. The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide rating indicates an improvement in our rating from  2.65 to 2.91 in this element. Although this is an area where we made the most improvement, we strongly believe we  should continue to strengthen family-community ties by welcoming and developing partnerships with families,  businesses, and community-based organizations. We are confident that working together will have a direct impact on  student performance.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X009   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   850   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The most important role is to teach students how to become skilled thinkers to promote their understanding and  their intellectual development, as these are the major goals of education in the 21st century classroom. Thinking  (usually) happens in students’ heads, but unfortunately it is not visible to either teachers or to students themselves.  This means that teachers continuously need to provide stimulating and supporting activities that help our students  externalize their thoughts through speaking, writing, and questioning. Thinking routines are the cornerstone for  engaging and involving students in their classroom activities and tools for teachers to follow their students’ thinking  process that help them discover their knowledge, misconceptions, reasoning ability, and understanding. Through  routinely making thinking visible, students will be able to improve their writing skills.   The findings from the 2016-17 Quality Review shows that we ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all  subjects, that is accessible for all learners, as demonstrated by the Well Developed Rating for indicator 1.1. This  review also indicates that although, we received a Proficient Rating for indicator 1.2 in developing teacher pedagogy  from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and the  Danielson Framework for Teaching, it is an area we need to continue working on. Additionally, based on the Measures  of Teacher Practice (MOTP) ratings from the Advance Teacher Development and Evaluation System, the average  MOTP rating in component 3b “Questioning and Discussion Techniques” is 2.9, which demonstrates the need for us to  continue developing teachers in instructional strategies around effective questioning, students making their thinking  visible, and engaging in academic discussions. We will support the entire faculty in implementing rigorous instruction  in their pedagogy to meet the needs of all learners. To address this need, we will implement targeted professional  learning opportunities that will help support this goal. Along with the Monday Professional Learning time, ENL and  Special Education teachers will attend off-site professional learning workshops. We will also continue to adapt the  curriculum to provide the needed supports for English Language Learners and Student with Disabilities to succeed.      Based on the New York State Standardized exams, a priority area of need is to improve students’ writing skills, with a  specific focus on English Language Learners. Based on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT (New York State English as a Second  Language Achievement Test) results, only 47% of the 259 students who were assessed progressed at least one  proficiency level. The data also indicates, from the four modalities assessed (Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing)  across all grades, writing had the lowest average scale score of 56. By supporting English Language Learners with  improving their writing skills, through the use of thinking maps, will help them succeed to meet both grade level  standards and language proficiency levels.

By the end of June 2019, the Teacher Support Team would have designed targeted ongoing professional development  aligned with the school’s instructional focus on making thinking visible, to improve the writing skills of our English  Language Learners. As a result, the average scale score on the NYSESLAT would have reflected an increase of at least 10  points in this modality.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  P.S. 9 will implement the principles of RULER, while enhancing and advancing the current PBIS system in order to  provide support and guide students with both social and emotional needs. This will foster a school that is safe,  conducive to learning, and one that is equitable and equal for all students. Each day all staff members and students  recite the P.S. 9 Ryer Avenue Pledge, which further builds a culture of excellence.      PS 9 is safe, inclusive, supports social-emotional growth, and high expectations are communicated to both students  and staff, as evidenced by the Proficient Rating and the score of 3.5 for QR indicators 1.4 and 3.4 in the 2016-17  Quality Review. However, according to the 2017-18 School Quality guide, there were 81% positive responses to  questions related to Safety; less than what we expected and we will continue to address any and all safety concerns.  Additionally, given 25% of our students live in temporary housing it is our goal to support these students with their  specific social and academic and needs.       Through the use of the RULER method, and the continuing strengthened used of PBIS, it is our goal to reduce  incidents and conflicts that may occur outside of the classrooms, such as the lunchroom, play yard and hallways. All  stakeholders will focus on developing knowledge and skills on ways to address the varying social and emotional health  needs of our students in order to promote academic success and foster a sense of ownership. As a community, P.S. 9  will celebrate the strengths of staff, teachers, students and parents.      The Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Committee and the Dean of Students will continue to work on a curriculum that  supports social-emotional well-being. This curriculum will be revisited and applied throughout the school year. It will  focus on creating a positive school culture for students and teachers alike. The lessons will focus on promoting  positive school behavior so that students have the tools to handle frustration and prevent negative behavior.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

At PS 9 we promote collaboration to ensure school improvement. In support of this practice, we created a schedules  and structures that facilitate collaborative work across grades and subjects for all teachers. As it relates to the  Collaborative Teachers element from the Framework for Great Schools, and in accordance with the 2017-2018 School  Quality Guide, 92% of our teachers responded positively to the peer collaboration opportunities at our school.   Furthermore, to make the school a strong learning organization, administrators ensure that feedback generated  through observations is aligned with the school-wide professional learning plan, and teachers implement the  strategies learned during PLCs, and other PDs. According to the 2016-17 Quality Review, QR Indicator 4.1 (Teacher  Support and Supervision) was rated “Well Developed” and considered an area of celebration. Administrators develop  schedules for formal and informal observations with teachers, including timely actionable feedback to promote  professional growth and reflection. The Quality Review also states that “teacher teams participate in regularly  structured collaborations, share in making key decisions about student learning that builds teacher capacity and  strengthens student learning outcomes.”   Given the strong culture of collaboration that is being fostered at our school; through this action plan we will continue  to address students’ needs by ensuring teachers understand the benefits of visible thinking and implement research- based practices that support students with the skills necessary to promote deep thinking. We will also collaborate in  providing CCLS based instruction with multiple entry points for different types of learners, and work towards creating  a learning environment that is responsive to students’ strengths and needs.   It is a priority to ensure the academic success of our students. Based on the Spring 2018 New York State Math Exam  results, only 25% of the 389 students who were assessed were able to meet grade level standards. This data indicates  that improving students’ mathematical conceptual understanding and problem solving skills is an area of need for our  school.    As a Professional Learning Community, the school will continue to work together and focus on improving instructional  practice to support student learning. Differentiated Professional Learning Cycles have been created to improve  instructional practice as it relates to making thinking visible in the Mathematics classroom to increase student  understanding and improve problem solving skills.

Supporting teachers with professional growth and creating effective instruction that increases student achievement is  a priority at PS 9.   As related to the Effective School Leadership element of the Framework for Great Schools, we feel that we have  established systems of accountability that set high expectations, create coherence across the school and help support  professional growth. As evidenced by two well developed indicators in the Systems for Improvement category of the  2016-2017 Quality Review; QR indicators 1.3 and 4.1, which was also identified as an area of celebration.    According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, our score in the Effective School Leadership Element was 3.68,  therefore meeting the target, however, there was a slight decrease from the previous year. In taking a closer look at  NYC Survey results, 70% of the teachers responded positively to questions related to teacher influence, which is lower  than the previous year. These questions relate to the influence teachers have in the development and selection of  instructional materials, as well as encouraging feedback from teachers in making decisions that support student  learning.   These results are in contrast with the feedback from the Quality Review for indicator 4.1 from the reviewer states,  “school leaders developed a strategic plan to support teachers in raising the quality of instruction, which led them to  engage all teachers in PLCs that are facilitating a school-wide common understanding of effective pedagogical  practices.” This indicates there is a need to close the gap between the belief of the school community and the  practices of the school leaders. We need to continue developing a climate of shared leadership that includes input  from all members to support the school vision for student achievement.    Through the action plan for this goal, we will work collaboratively with teachers to analyze and improve the systems  and structures we have in place to be able to improve school-wide practices, to better support student learning and  address any learning gaps. We will continue to use multiple data sources to make programmatic decisions, identify  areas of focus, and guide the way we support the faculty with their professional growth to improve teacher practice  throughout the school.    According to the 2017-18 Measures of Teacher Practice based on the Danielson Framework for Teaching from the  Advance teacher evaluation system, we found that the average MOTP rating for component 3B “Questioning and  Discussion Techniques” was a 2.9. This plan will focus on improving teacher practice as it relates to the questioning  and discussion techniques teachers use to drive instruction to support student learning.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   It is our ongoing goal to continue to provide a welcoming environment for PS 9 families, to continue fostering a  strong partnership between school and home so that our students succeed. As part of this goal we plan to provide  families with the necessary support they need to provide developmentally appropriate academic and social  emotional support to their children.   To be able to accomplish this, we will provide targeted and specific workshops and school events to help parents with  understanding the curriculum, assessments, and different strategies that will help support students in and outside of  school.   According to the 2017-18 NYC School Survey 89% responded positively to questions about Strong Family-Community  ties. We will continue to work on strengthening outreach efforts and trying to engage families, so they can become  more active participants in the school community and support student learning and performance. It is our goal to  provide families with specific data on student performance of grade-level standards, and what students need to do in  order to improve and increase achievement. We also plan to support families with understanding how to use the  data to help students achieve and make progress.   One of the school’s strengths connected to the Strong Family-Community Ties element is setting and communicating  high expectations. 91% of parents say the school staff communicates with them on how they can help their child  learn, compared to 89% for the previous year. Additionally, according to the 2016-17 Quality Review, we were rated  proficient for indicator 3.4. The reviewer stated, “high expectations are embedded throughout school structures,  resulting in a system of accountability for staff. The school offers families information related to their children’s  academic performance and progress.”    We will continue to involve more parents in specific activities that support student learning and ensure parents  understand they are the key to their children’s success. The 2017-18 School Quality Guide indicates 85% positive  responses as it relates to parent involvement in the school, our goal is to increase that to be closer to the city average  of 90%.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Highly qualified teachers are recruited through a variety of ways after having met state and city requirements to  become a public school teacher. Borough-wide teacher recruitment fairs provide potential candidates. All candidates,  plus applicants who send in resumes independent of system-wide structures, are screened and interviewed variably  by the principal, assistant principals, and teachers at PS 9. Demonstration lessons have been requested from final  candidates.       Additionally, we have created a PS 9 brochure and website that are used as resources for recruiting teachers who  share our vision and are able to help us to achieve our mission. We are also collaborating with Lehman College. P.S. 9  serve as host to student teachers from Lehman College. Our expectation is that through this relationship we will be  able to identify highly qualified teachers for any anticipated vacancies.      Once we hire a teacher, we provide the supports teachers need to become part of our learning community. We start  first by hosting a “New Teacher Orientation” before school begins, where we provide new teachers with information  about school protocols, schedules, curriculum and resources available. Every new teacher is also assigned a mentor  and as part of their grade team they have both a grade leader and an immediate administrator to support them. As a  school that is very collaborative new teachers are given the opportunity to work with other teachers as part of PLCs  and through inter-class inter-visitations. We also have a Staff Developer, Peer Collaborative Teacher, Math and  Guided Reading Coaches, and a ULIT Coach that will support new teachers with the curriculum and best teaching  practices. We create a differentiated Professional Development Plan to support all teachers based on classroom  observations, needs assessment, teacher self-reflections and interest.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      To ensure that current staff becomes highly qualified ongoing, on-site support will be provided through new teacher  mentoring. There is school-based mentoring and grade level peer support that will promote professional learning and  growth. Professional learning opportunities will include topics such as classroom environment, classroom  management, curriculum planning, and assessments. Teacher leaders will continue to participate in citywide and  Borough Field Support Center professional learning opportunities to maintain the level of qualification according to  current trends.       As stated above, workshops and PL opportunities in current “best practices” will continue to be provided to all staff  members. The Math and Literacy consultants, vertical team, Staff Developer and coaches will deliver professional  development to teachers so that they can have a positive impact on student learning and achievement. A math and  literacy consultant have been hired to provide teachers with strategies for addressing high needs learners, particularly  students with disabilities.      Additionally, as stated above our differentiated Professional Development Plan supports all teachers based on  classroom observations, needs assessment, teacher self-reflections and interest. We use the data from the Advance  Teacher Observation Tool to identify areas of need that are school wide, and teacher specific. We have created  different learning cycles to address these needs, such as a Questioning and Discussing learning cycle, an Assessment  learning cycle, and a Designing Coherent Instruction learning cycle. We also provide teachers with in-class modeling  and coaching by Literacy and Math consultants and in-house coaches.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  N/A        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      At PS 9 we understand the significance of engaging families to ensure students succeed. In accordance with Goal #5,  we plan to increase parental involvement by creating events and programs that support Preschool families. We will  capitalize on these families to support their children’s academic, social, and emotional skills, through targeted  workshops and events. Our goal is to create a smooth transition from the Preschool programs offered at PS 9 to our  Kindergarten and elementary programs. We plan the following activities to assist preschool children in the transition  from early childhood programs to the elementary programs:      ● Targeted family workshops for preschool families to show parents ways to support their children with developing  academic, social and emotional skills   ● Kindergarten Orientation, to introduce families to the teachers and the academic expectations in Kindergarten   ● PS 9 Brochure for Preschool families with information about Kindergarten teachers and school programs available.   ● School tours and open house events to familiarize families with key personnel and the resources available in main  building.      Additionally, we provide many opportunities for our pre-kindergarten students to participate in school activities with  the kindergarten students throughout the school year. The Pre-k students also attend physical education and all  assemblies that kindergarten students attend.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Throughout the school year we meet regularly with data teams to analyze student work to adjust the curriculum and  instructional practice. With the creation of data teams, we can align teaching pedagogy with the curriculum to reflect  our set of beliefs about how students learn best. As part of the learning in our Professional Learning Community there  was a six-week cycle based on using assessment to provide students with actionable feedback. We use the ATLAS –  Learning from Student Work protocol to guided groups of teachers to discover what students understand and how  they are thinking. By using this protocol, student work is the centerpiece of the group discussion. Teacher teams plan  classroom activities jointly, teach it independently, then bring the student work back to the group for discussion.  Through the analysis of data, teacher teams are able to reflect on the content of the data in order to modify and  differentiate instruction for various learners. Our school teams have also implemented a “norming” process. During  norming, teachers align their scoring so that every member of the team applies the rubric consistently across students  and to ensure that the team of teachers scores consistently with one another. Having similar scoring and uniform  expectations of student work is critical in order to make meaningful comparisons among students. Teacher teams  analyze data by assessing Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) progress and the New York State English  Language Arts (ELA) and New York State Math exam results by using the Notice and Wonder protocol. Our purpose is  to turn data into action by creating a systematic process for reviewing and responding to data.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51       2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Ryer Avenue Elementary School, in compliance Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and  support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents  informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children.  Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Ryer Avenue Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.         In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Increasing  communication to forge the home-school connect will be addressed as well. We will also focus  on the language progression standards for both the home and new language.     Our school's Professional Learning Planning Committee meets to make recommendations for the  Professional Learning Cycles (PLC) plan for the school. They evaluate ongoing professional  learning, reflecting on how the sessions will improve teacher practice and affect student  outcome. Teachers will also provide feedback on their needs and experiences throughout their  PLCs.    Teachers who serve ELLs, clearly identified by the NYCDOE screening, ATS system reports for  transfer students, and NYSELSAT data, will participate in professional learning opportunities to  support students in both developing content knowledge while learning English. This group will  include teachers who provide direct instruction to ELL students: transitional bilingual education  teachers, English-as-a-New Language teachers who provide instruction in self-contained, push- in, and pull-out scenarios, Common Branches and Specialist teachers who instruct students in the  free-standing ENL program.    PS 9 has clearly identified a program of professional enhancement for teachers to pursue based  on teacher feedback and the NYCDOE Advance teacher evaluation data.  Program duration will  vary depending on the topic, but will always be preceded and followed up with professional  learning communities facilitated by the school Staff Developer, literacy and math coaches, a  Universal Literacy K-2 coach, “Southern Consultancy” Math and Literacy consultant coaches,  (Robb Irwin and Sue Rayson), ELL Supervisor, Assistant Principals, or Principal, as applicable.  Teacher leaders will have the opportunity to share their knowledge and expertise, as well.    Southern Consultancy outside-consultants, Sue Rayson and Robb Irwin are each contracted for  20 days this academic year (not funded with Title III funds). Their work will require some  programming changes to accommodate meetings with various teacher teams. Professional  support exists in the form of Curricular Mapping, In-class Support, Demonstration Lessons, and  In-class Coaching. These have been the models used thus far, based on assessed need.

PS 9 has been successful in increasing the  participation of ELL parents by Breakfasts with the Principal and Welcome orientations that are  bilingual events. We have purchased individual translation devices that allow for simultaneous  translation of the presenter’s content. Parents are informed spot-on. In this way, ELL parents can  actively understand and participate in all events. In fact, Ms. Marisol Colbert, the Parent  Association President has become very active with our bilingual parent body, even serving as an  enthusiastic workshop presenter for parents.     Mara Resto, Parent Coordinator, has and will deliver the following events for parents of ELLs,  Get Ready NY: Especially for Bilingual Parents on How to Ask Questions at Parent Teachers  Conferences on various topics such as Bilingual Health, Mental Health, and Hygiene.

In  addition, a “Dinner with the Principal” event is scheduled regularly throughout the year, from  6:00 – 8:00 PM, with a specific Informational Table to address any needs and questions  presented by parents of ELLs. Additional parent engagement activities that will help support our  parents of ELLs will be scheduled throughout the year.    Two Family Literacy activities will also be scheduled in the spring over two days, just for our  ELL parent body. The first day will be for TBE classes and the second day will be for ENL  students and families celebrating literacy achievements of students. Light refreshments and  family literacy packs will be distributed. This will be a replication of successful parent outreach  events that we have presented in the past.    We will also provide three afternoon technology-based events for both parents and students. Pre- selected ELL parents and children from grades 1-2 will be invited to participate in a Digital  Literacy program to build and develop both language and technological skills. We have a well  equipped technology lab that will allow for parent participation. This will be a bilingual program  with Ms. Morfe, TBE Teacher conducting the translation for Mr. Anthony Muia and Mr. William  Gentzsch, who will share the instruction. Topics planned are Using Google and Yahoo to  Conduct Internet Searches, Using Email as a Communication Tool, Accessing Internet  Resources, and Accessing parent/student accounts, as these all relate to student learning based on  the home-school connect. Students will work alongside their parents to learn the same digital  skills. This is planned as an after-school Friday program. Digital Literacy for Families: Parents  and Children will run in early Spring for three different sessions, from 2:30 – 4:30 PM.  Additional home-school celebrations like publication parties, holiday and spring festivals, and  multicultural day will involve our parents of ELLs. Our School-wide Field Day for upper and  lower grades always involves parents in the planning and realization of the event. ELL parents  are always attended to and supported by our staff. As a school we concentrate our efforts in  involving and supporting our ELL parents in all school-wide activities.  HOW PARENTS WILL  BE NOTIFIED OF THESE ACTIVITIESParents will be notified via the school website, the  school calendar, letters, and/or announcements in both English and Spanish. Additionally, we  have some instructional staff who are fluent in some of the African languages represented in our  school. Announcements will also be back-packed and distributed at parent conferences. Postings  will appear on all doors from which parents enter and exit. Laminated announcements will hang  on fences that perimeter the school building. Announcements over the speaker address system  may take place as a final reminder for students for parents. Phone calls to parents who have  expressed particular interest in workshop/meeting topics will be made. We also have a  permanent lighted school announcements sign that is grounded in concrete at the main entrance  to the school.   The following describes additional efforts to engage parents of ELLs: Parents have the  opportunity to access ps9online.org, the school website to learn about ongoing events and to  communicate with classroom teachers on the class page. Our school website has a feature that  translates the content to various different languages.  Acquisition of the English LanguageWe are fortunate to have the borough-wide Welcome Center  housed in our school. Parents are encouraged to attend their English language/ENL classes that  are offered during the day or evening. Citizenship preparation classes are also offered. Field trips  for parents take them around the city, which serves as another vehicle for education and  information. We invite them to our larger school events and they reciprocate. The Welcome  Center is located in one section of our first floor, creating a wing for adult learners.  Curriculum Understanding: Literacy, Mathematics, and the Content AreasAs described above,  through Meet the Teacher, Breakfast with the Principal, Dinner with the Principal sessions,  Parent Conferences, and LEAP partnerships, parents will participate in sessions that will allow   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    them to experience and understand what their children do in school. The school Literacy Block  with its component such asread-aloud, mini lesson, guided reading and independent practice will  also be discussed and demonstrated. Parents can better understand Literacy terms and supports  such as what leveling correlates and guided reading mean. There will be much emphasis on how  parents can support school efforts. We will also focus on looking at food and nutrition and the  home environment to augment student learning.  To support Mathematics, parents will have the  opportunity to use math manipulatives and play math games to understand how concrete  understanding leads to conceptual understanding. To support their children's learning as related  to Science, parents will be invited to the Science Fair, providing parents with the opportunity to  be involved.  Classroom LearningAs indicated in the beginning narrative above, parents are and will be invited  to classroom activities and celebrations through the year. Parents will have the opportunity to  hear their children read books aloud, and present their achievements in writing. Holiday  celebrations and birthdays are occasions that involve parents. Parent chaperoning on field trips  also involves them in their children's learning. This is also another venue through which they  will be able to see and learn about the city for lively discussions with their children. The Science  Fair, Multicultural Day, Holiday Assemblies, Honor Roll assemblies, and Graduation are also  good opportunities for parents to see how classroom learning comes to fruition. We will also  invite parents to the PEP Rallies we have before the standardized ELA and Math exams; this  will  motivate students and parents to focus on success.    Health and Nutrition  The school nurse and social worker have conducted sessions to address asthma, weight control,  and good food and nutrition. We have held sessions with healthy food tastings as an alternative  to junk and convenience foods. It is our goal to work in conjunction with them in order to  continue to provide parents with the necessary supports to promote making healthy and good  lifestyle choices.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 9 assesses the early literacy skills of students using a variety of assessments in order to gather multiple sources of data, and  be able to make more informed decisions on the instructional programming of the school.    The Dra2 is administered three times a year for grades K to 5 to assess and identify students’ independent reading levels. A  baseline is administered in October, a midyear in February and an end-year in May. The data gathered from the DRA2 is  utilized at the class, grade and school level to be able to guide instruction and interventions for students who need additional  support. Teachers also continuously monitor student levels through informal running records to differentiate instruction. In  grades K-2 teachers use the Fundations phonics program to monitor student progress and provide the necessary scaffolds to  meet individual student needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69        Assessing early reading skills using multiple data sources in conjunction with language proficiency test scores, the school aligns  with professional research that shows the correlation between native language literacy and a student's ability to acquire  literacy skills in a new language. The data from these multiple sources shows the need to provide early reading intervention  that support early reading skills, such as sound-symbol correspondence and word recognition.    Teachers also used curriculum-based assessments from ReadyGen and GoMath which are composed of a combination of  multiple choice and performance tasks. These assessments allow the teachers to gauge and monitor student understanding  and mastery of grade-level standards.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Formative assessment data is used to create small groups for targeted skill-based instruction. Additionally, we have  implemented a Peer Support Guided Reading program, where teachers can work collaboratively to provide guided reading to  two small groups simultaneously, therefore expanding the level of support students receive. Teachers work together to plan a  create targeted lesson plans to target specific skills and meet the individual needs of the students. The data is also utilized to  provide Tier II and III interventions for students who are not making adequate progress.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To evaluate the success of programs at PS 9 that support Ells, we use the results of New York state NYSESLAT exams and  standardized exams in ELA, Math, and Science. The end of unit assessments are also utilized to measure student mastery of  grade level standards. These measures give us information on students’ academic performance in meeting grade level  standards.    The NYSESLAT exam results provide us information on student progress and performance level in acquiring the new language  of English. We are able to do comparative analyses of different subgroups, types of programs, teacher effectiveness, etc. Using  this data, we can measure student performance levels and the growth made from one academic year to the next. This allows  us to provide the necessary supports for students who are not making AYP and teacher support in improving instructional  practice.     For example, in the 2016-17 AY we were able to compare student growth in the three different types of programs we have,  and found that more students in the Transitional Bilingual program demonstrated growth. 58% of the students of the students  in the TBE program moved at least more than one proficiency level, in comparison with students who are in ENL programs. We  were also able to identify the average scale score of each modality, by grade band, program type, proficiency level, and class.  Using this data the ENL team will meet to discuss possible learning and/or instructional gaps that may exist and be able to  address them. As such, the data indicates that overall there needs to be a stronger focus on writing; across all grades, the  lowest average scale score of the four modalities is writing. Data will continue to be used to analyze program effectiveness as  measured by student progress. This will also help us evaluate programs’ structure, teacher practice, and professional  development needs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students receive the appropriate scaffolds and supports based on their language proficiency levels.   Differentiated instruction  is given to those students who may experience difficulty despite whole class instruction.  Teachers use graphic organizers,  sentence starters, visuals, manipulatives, etc. to help students build content are schema and support language development.    The ENL Team will also meet to analyze the data to identify trends and patterns across the grades, and to identify instructional  strategies to close the learning gaps, such as ways to support Entering students with speaking, as that was the area with the  lowest average scale score for Entering students.    Additionally, the Teacher Support Team, comprised of the Staff Developer, Math Coach, Guided Reading Coach, ULIT Coach,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Data Specialist, and Administration, will plan professional learning for teachers of ELLs to expand teacher pedagogy and make  curricular adaptations that meet the needs of ELLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     A number of different data sources are used to determine if the child falls within the RTI framework.  There are informal  interviews and inventories, DRA2 results, additional running records, in-class formative assessments, NYSITELL/NYSESLAT  results, and parent interviews. If a child is determined to fall within the framework, RTI services can assist home or English  language development. The student is assessed in his/her most proficient language of functioning. Teacher and service  providers will be consulted in the decision-making process and recommendations for RTI. This is the initial process for  matching the students with services along the RTI continuum in providing intervention and progress monitoring.     As for implementing RTI services that are culturally sensitive to ELLs, in the past our school has been a participant of the city- wide, OELL professional learning opportunities, and we hope to have the opportunity to continue in the 2017-2018 school  year. Teachers will use on-going formative assessment tools, which will consist of collection and evaluation of student work,  rubrics, portfolios, checklists, student self-assessments, surveys and questionnaires; the data will then be used to design  coherent instruction using instructional techniques such as:                      -  Checking for understanding,                   -  Helping ELL students with Socio-emotional needs to support learning                    -  Adjusting teaching styles to meet the individual student needs                    -  Engaging students in learning and providing necessary scaffolds to improve and increase student performance.                     -Using the data from these multiple on-going formative assessment sources to support students to work  independently on targeted instructional needs.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     During the spring of 2017, a total of 264 ELLs participated in the NYSESLAT testing.  A total of 10 (3.8%) students scored in the  Entering level range, 43 (16.3%) scored in the Emerging level range, 86 (32.6%) scored in the Transitioning level range, while  108(41%) scored in the Expanding level range. 17 (6.4%) students were able to achieve the Commanding level, therefore will  be now classified as Former Ells.    Across the board, at all proficiency levels, P.S.9 students have shown an increase in English language proficiency. 123 (47%)  students were able to move at least one proficiency level or more. However, the data also indicates 136 (53%) students either  made no growth or reversed in proficiency level. When comparing the three different programs in place at PS 9, it was notable  that more students in the Transitional Bilingual Education programs made progress; 58% (61 out of 106 students). This clearly  supports the research that indicates that students who are taught in their home language will receive the support needed to  acquire a new language. Furthermore, when comparing self-contained ENL classes and the Push-In Integrated ENL support,  51% of the students who received the ENL support made progress vs. only 29% of the students in the self-contained ENL  classes. This will lead us to analyze the instruction in both programs and determine what lead to a higher success rate for the  Push-In program, and steps that can be taken to meet the needs of the students in the self-contained ENL classes.    The data from the NYSESLAT is also utilized to group students in a way that maximizes the level of support they receive based  on their proficiency levels. ELL students who require the same numer of mandated minutes are placed within the same classes,  to allow ENL teachers to provide both push-in and pull-out support.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   School administrators meet to discuss and analyze NYSESLAT data to identify trends and patterns across grades, program  types, teachers, and proficiency levels. The Teacher Support Team, comprised of the Staff Developer, Math Coach, Guided   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         Reading Coach, ULIT Coach, Data Specialist, and Administration, will also meet to plan professional learning and support for  teachers of ELLs.    This data will also be shared with the ENL team (all teachers who teach ELLS)         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At P.S. 9 we have various ways of delivering the ENL instructional program to meet the many varying needs of our  students in order to maximize student learning and be able to provide the necessary supports for the different English  proficiency levels.    Across all grades there will be a mixture of self-contained ENL classes where a dually certified teacher will provide  both stand-alone ENL and Integrated ENL, and classes where there will be a combination of Integrated and Stand- alone ENL through a pushing in and pulling out model. Grades K, 1, , 3, 4 and 5 will have self-contained ENL classes  taught by dually certified teachers. In grades 4 and 5 there will also be ICT classes where one teacher is dually certified  to meet the needs of any ELL in the class who may have an IEP, therefore minimizing time students need to be pulled  out for ENL instruction, and allowing both the ENL and Special Ed teachers to jointly plan instruction that will meet the  needs of ELL students with IEPs.    Students are grouped heterogeneously in self-contained ENL classes as well as in general education classes where  their instruction will either be provided through push-in or pull-out or both. When standalone instruction is provided,  the students are usually grouped homogeneously. Instruction is differentiated for students not only according to  language proficiency, but for skill and ability. Entering and Emerging students are grouped to receive 360 minutes of  weekly ENL and stand-alone and integrated ENL instruction, whereas Transitioning and Expanding students will  receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction. Students who have attained the Commanding proficiency level on  the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Transitional bilingual classes are homogeneous only according to grade and program type selected by the parent:  Transitional Spanish Bilingual. Students travel together to specialist classes in a block. However, within the various  transitional bilingual classes there is a wide range of English language proficiency from Entering to Expanding across  all grades, this poses a challenge in meeting the varying programming ENL needs.  In order to meet the ENL needs, all  students in a TBE program will get at least one unit of Integrated ENL/ELA (180 minutes) and only the Entering and  Emerging students will receive additional stand-alone ENL instruction. 180 minutes for Entering students, and 90  minutes for Emerging students. Furthermore, all students will receive Home Language Arts Instruction in Spanish, and  Bilingual content area instruction in Spanish, the units will vary depending on students’ proficiency level.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      TBE Program  Based on the C-Part 154 and the chart listed on the NYSED, all students in a TBE program will get at least one unit of Integrated  ENL/ELA (180 minutes a week) and only the Entering and Emerging students will receive additional stand-alone ENL  instruction. 180 minutes a week for Entering students, and 90 minutes a week for Emerging students. Furthermore, all  students will receive Home Language Arts Instruction in Spanish, and Bilingual content area instruction in Spanish, the units  will vary depending on students’ language proficiency level.    Self-Contained ENL Program  Based on the C-Part 154 and the chart listed on the NYSED, all students in a self-contained ENL program where the teacher is  dually certified in both ESOL and Common branches, ENL instruction will be delivered by the classroom teacher. The teacher  will deliver both the stand-alone ENL and the integrated ENL. All students will receive 180 minutes a week of Integrated ENL  and only the Entering and Emerging students will receive additional stand-alone ENL instruction; 180 minutes a week for  Entering students, and 90 minutes a week for Emerging students. Commanding students will receive 90 minutes a week of  Integrated ENL instruction.    ENL Program- for students who are not in Self-contained classes  Similar to both the TBE and self-contained ENL programs, ELL students who must receive ENL instruction will receive 180  minutes a week of integrated ENL instruction, where a certified ESOL teacher will push-in to a class and co-teach with a K-6  certified teacher, or a dually certified teacher will pull out students. Entering and Emerging students will receive additional  stand-alone ENL instruction through a pull out model by a certified ESOL teacher; 180 minutes a week for Entering students,  and 90 minutes a week for Emerging students.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Each program model, TBE self-contained ENL and free-standing ENL with push-in and pull out instruction ensures that  instruction in the content areas is delivered. In TBE classes, the language of instruction is Spanish for two content areas i.e.,  Math and Science. In free-standing ENL classes, the teacher instructs in English with the necessary supports in the home  language and a focus on English Language acquisition. The following is the instructional approaches and methods to attain  instruction and enrichment:    Instruction in Integrated ENL classes is delivered via cross-curricular immersion. Students learn by using all modalities to  acquire understanding. Students speak, listen, and hear modeled English teachers, content specialist teachers and peers.  Students will be able to access the content by interacting with classmates with varying levels of language proficiencies, which  allows them to practice and develop an enriched language.    In order to provide even greater enriched activities to make content more accessible to ELLs the Science specialist teacher has  developed a Science laboratory with living things; plants and animals. The annual Science Fair is also an event that students  prepare for, and look forward to. Students are engaged in a number of activities that benefit various community groups as  they participate in student council programs. Additionally, specially funded programs, such as LEAP, which brings teaching  artists to the school, assists in content area learning. The school has contacted groups who deliver content area learning via  the performance arts of music, drama, poetry, and athleticism.    In Mathematics, students may be grouped according to academic and/or intervention needs, depending on the content that  must be mastered. The GoMath curriculum PS 9 currently uses provides ELL students the opportunity to develop oral academic  language using “Math Talk” In early childhood classes, the content areas are subsumed under thematic instruction. Content  area instruction becomes more specialized as the student moves through the upper grades. There is also a great deal of  collaboration between ENL and K-6 monolingual class teachers of students in their programs. ENL and TBE teachers also meet  and collaborate to implement the best practices for the development of language proficiency.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      Teachers use ongoing formative assessment tools which consist of collection and evaluation of student work, rubrics,  portfolios, checklists, student self-assessments, surveys and questionnaires to assess home language development and literacy  skills. We also administer the Spanish Home Language assessment across all grades to  be able to identify students' strengths  and deficiencies in their home language. In the K-2 TBE classes we plan to use Estrellita, a Spanish language literacy  development program. Teachers in the early grades will progress through a program of assessment and instruction that places  students through Sonidos Inciales Assessments. Students’ progress through "Silabas," to "Oraciones," and "Palabras" of all  vowel letters and combinations therein. A regular course of study with prescribed chants, activities, and games will take place  on a daily basis     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The following is a description of how P.S 9 differentiates instruction for the ELL subgroups:    To ensure that our SIFE students receive appropriate instruction, they are provided with the necessary interventions in the  classroom to strengthen the foundations in their home language. Another option available to our SIFE students is the provision  of the services of a bilingual paraprofessional. Instruction is differentiated within the classrooms, they work in small groups,  engage in activities that activate prior knowledge such as KWL charts; use text with content which is age appropriate but with  more accessible lexile levels, differentiated vocabulary activities and peer support. We will also continue to use other  programs and interventions available to us such as Great Leaps, iReady, differentiated instruction in small groups, cooperative  learning, and/or individualized instruction.    Our newcomers receive instruction that is developmentally aligned to the principles of language acquisition as well as the NYS  Common Core Learning Standards. Students will receive Tier I and II interventions to meet their individual content and  language acquisition needs in both the ELA and Math core curricula.  Teachers will also use instructional strategies that  promote language development such as graphic organizers, picture and textual cues. To facilitate comprehension, teachers  provide students with cognates, experiential learning, project-based learning and field trips.    In order to support developing ELLs, the focus of instruction with this particular group is to continue to develop literacy skills  that center around stronger vocabulary knowledge. Instructional strategies such as close reading and chunking are used with  more frequency. Materials such as high interest/low readability books and articles, are also incorporated into the lessons and  made available for leisure reading.     The demands on our long-term ELLs and the approach are a bit more rigorous. We continue to provide RTI interventions, and  continue to closely monitor and evaluate the skills that this particular group needs while strengthening the already acquired or  emerging skills. Differentiated and individualized instruction is provided with the understanding that expectations for student  work products are high. Students are also expected to monitor their own progress with tools such as using rubrics to self- assess. Ongoing formative assessments are used to determine if some of the language difficulties the student may experience  are the results of a learning disability; which may require a referral for a formal evaluation by the Special Education team.    Former ELLs who have achieved a Commanding proficiency level within the past two years will continue to receive 90 minutes  a week of integrated ENL support. Additionally, they will also be entitled to services such as Academic After School Program,  Extended Day, Saturday Academy, and After School Programs that are offered to our FELLs. Testing accommodations on New  York State examinations will continue to be provided.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      To meet the needs and demands of our ELL-SWD at P.S. 9 we use two curriculums that are aligned to the NYS Common Core.  The curriculums are Go Math and Ready Gen. Ready Gen and Go Math provide differentiation and scaffold for all students with  multiple entry points. Teachers support students by using visuals and audio with Smartboard technology. Some instructional  strategies used in ENL and TBE classrooms are as follows: direct instruction, small group instruction, and vocabulary  development for ELLs (Using tier one, tier two, and tier three) everything is supported by visuals. We also use picture word  walls. Another strategy used on a daily basis is close reading, DEAR time, iReady, Fundations, and guided reading. We use  strategies such as making thinking visible using thinking maps where students chose the map that best fits their needs.     The lower grades and students with low academic skills also benefit from Fundations to improve student phonemic and  phonological skills and reading fluency. All classroom teachers at PS 9 deliver instructions within a Response to Intervention  (RTI) model that allows progressive and more intensive support for struggling students within the classroom, and through  external teacher support such as the Reading teacher, RTI/Literacy teacher, Staff Developer, and ULIT coach.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In our school, the ELL-SWDs classes are scheduled together with General Education classes, to provide the least restrictive  environment as possible; teachers of each grade have the same common preparation period every week. During this period,  teachers come together and plan, look at student work and talk about best practices. There is also a Response to Intervention  team that meets biweekly to discuss students at risk and provide them with intensive instruction.     In programming ENL instruction for ELL-SWDs, we make every effort to provide push-in support for Special Ed classes so that  students are not pulled from their Core subjects, and instead have the ENL teacher collaborate with the Special Education  teacher to provide language acquisition support using ENL research-based strategies. This year we even ensured our staffing  met the needs of our ELL-SWD students by providing two ICT classes that have both a Special Ed teacher and a dually certified  ESOL and Common Branch (K-6) teacher to provide the necessary scaffolds and interventions that will help the ELL-SWDs meet  both their IEP goals and attain English proficiency.    At P.S. 9 we teach our ELL-SWD using a Common Core State Standards aligned curricula; ReadyGen ELA and GoMath. In both  curricula, there are level three Response to Intervention (RTI) activities to support students who struggle with new concepts. In  an effort to enable ELL-SWD to achieve their IEP goals an attain English proficiency the RTI team meets every Monday to  discuss strategies and best practices for at risk students. These strategies are implemented Tuesday through Friday for twenty  minutes on a one to one instruction. After some time, the RTI teacher confers with the classroom teacher and the team to  make further suggestions about the student. Fundations is also used from kindergarten to second grade to support students  with phonics instruction.    There are certain instructional strategies that teachers use in their classrooms to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP  goals; Teachers conduct multiple assessments: formal, informal, diagnostic, formative, summative, quantitative, and  qualitative to determine students’ strengths and areas of need first, then plan lessons that will meet the need of each learner.  Once difficulties in specific skills are identified, interventions are designed to support students in acquiring the targeted skills.  Teachers use explicit instruction: make classroom expectations clear (Essential questions and objectives). Classroom  procedures are orderly, structured, and predictable. A purpose for learning is always established through the use of learning  targets. Teachers model desired outcome and guide students through new learning and model strategies through think- alouds.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs at PS 9 have included small group intensive instruction based on Fundations for  students in grades K-2, using a classroom-based RTI model to provide targeted instruction to struggling students.    A Title III funded Academic After School program meets three times a week by licensed ESOL/Bilingual teachers to offer   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      students in TBE and ENL programs from grades 3-5 additional support as they work in grade level and mixed-grade cooperative  learning groups.    This is in addition to the Winter and Spring Academy programs that provides students with support in ELA and Math  instruction. Teachers use NYSESLAT data, along with other formal and informal assessments to determine differentiated  needs. This quantitative data, added to a host of qualitative data that the teachers collect and share, provides for meeting the  needs of the total student.    During the Title III Academic After School program and the Winter and Spring Academies, ELLs are taught by licensed  ESOL/Bilingual teachers who cover cross-curricular materials, including Social Studies and Science.     Throughout, best practices and strategies for the instruction of ELLs to acquire English are put in place. Professional Learning  opportunities are afforded to all teachers of ELLs to understand the varying needs of ELLs and instructional practices that will  support new language acquisition.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The programs or improvements being considered for the upcoming school year are:  Words Their Way, Reading A to Z, NY TEAM Tool kits (Teaching ELLS for Academic Language Mastery), Reading Recovery  trained teachers to support the students, additional technology for the classrooms, monthly parent workshops to expose  parents to what the students are learning at school and how they can help them. These tools will allow us to pinpoint skills  students are struggling with, and be able to differentiate instruction for all students, especially ELLs. Additionally, we will use  MyOn a a digital library with more than 9,000 books and multimedia, which also includes assessments and close reading  tools.  Teachers will be able to track student's reading growth and activities.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Considering one third of the population at P.S. 9 is English language learners. We ensure that there is equity to access for all  parents and children. Starting with our parents, we ensure that all material that is sent to the home is available in two  languages. Translation and interpretation is available by a range of PS 9 staff. Teachers, parent coordinator, PA members,  secretaries, school aides, teaching and social work interns, and guidance counselors can speak Spanish.     Well-attended "Meet the Teacher" has an opening assembly that is presented in two languages. Breakfast with the Principal,  alternated with Dinner with the Principal, is also presented in two languages. Parents feel welcome and informed as a result.  Parents receive information on a range of topics focusing on instruction, as each teacher presents a beginning of the year  program to inform parents about curriculum. Parents are also informed about compliance as pertains to Title I, ELL and Special  Education issues.  Parents receive ongoing information about the school-day, after-school programs, Winter and Spring  Academies, and recess programs. Finally, we welcome parents' questions and search for information to support their children  both socially and academically.    All ELLs are given equal opportunity to all school programs. We have after school programs that specifically support ELLs, for ex  example we have a second grade after school program that targets the skills students need to develop, as informed by the  NYSESLAT results from the Spring 2017 assessment. Additionally, we have Civics in Literature program, which specifically  targets immigrant students to help develop students' knowledge of American history and government, and civic  responsibility.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use materials determined by the NYCDOE core curriculum programs These include Ready Gen for literacy, and GoMath,  Foss for science, and Passport to Social Studies.  Additionally, all teachers use a variety of supplemental materials and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      resources to enhance the curriculum for ELLs.

Our school has a technology room where students can use computers, iPad and laptop carts.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided in TBE classrooms across the school, by both the teacher and the instructional  programming. Home Language Arts, and instruction in the content areas are delivered in Spanish, the home language. All  students will receive at least one period of home language instruction, and one or two periods in a content area, depending on  students' language proficiency levels. Home language library collections are housed in each TBE classroom, in the school's  library, and the Literacy room. Home language is also supported in the ENL classes by ensuring students who share a common  language have the opportunity to work together to support each other, to be able to  provide scaffolds in the home language  that will assist students to in acquiring the English language.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instructional programs and materials identified for use with ELLs are matched, modified, and/or adapted to meet the  developmental levels of our ELLs as there is no one-size-fits all model that can work. P.S. 9 ensures all required  services/resources support and correspond to ELLs age and grade levels through a number of measures. On each grade levels  there are two program options for ELLs: Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) and English as a new language (ENL). Parents  have the opportunity to choose the program for their child at the ELL Parent Orientation for newly enrolled ELLs. Parents are  invited to parent/teacher meetings and conferences to discuss their child’s progress and instruction. The school provides  qualified translation services through in person translators and the translation and interpretation unit to ensure there is clear  communication.    Additionally, the Language Proficiency Team meets to discuss language and special needs for newly enrolled students with  IEPs; to identify the services and resources required to support the student. This team includes: a school administrator, a  certified ESOL teacher, the student’s classroom teacher, a school based support team member, the director of special  education, and the parent.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The new student is welcomed to our school by the one of the members of the ENL team, Ms. Lockwood, Ms. Lancut, Ms.  Torres, or Ms. Breton. These ENL teachers are the first contact upon arrival at P.S. 9. They are given a general orientation and  they are introduced to the new teacher that the child will be placed with until the NYSITELL can be administered to determine  if a student is an ELL. When the results are known the parents are invited to a parent orientation meeting with a certified ESOL  teacher, at which time the parent can select the program of choice for his/her child, if it has been determined that the student  is an ELL.     In the child's homeroom the receiving teacher provides extra support as the child becomes acclimated to the new class.  He/she will be assigned a buddy to further assist in becoming familiar with class procedures. P.S. 9 has been able to offer early  registration, and NYSITELL testing.  This has provided added time for the school and family to prepare the student for a smooth  start to school.    We also plan to offer parent workshops throughout the year with topics that are relevant and important for ELL students and  families, such as on early literacy skills, homework help, using technology to support students. These workshops will be offered  by the Staff Developer, ENL and bilingual teachers, librarian, and technology teacher.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Because we are an elementary school, language electives are not offered at this level.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   P.S. 9 does not have a Dual language Program.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The P.S. 9 professional development plan for ELL personnel is a living document, and it is a comprehensive one that will  include, school administrators, the ENL Team, school secretaries, ENL and bilingual teachers and all teachers.    1. School secretaries will be trained on the incoming process of new students to determine student enrollment status and  steps that must be followed. They will also be trained on best practices, protocols to follow, and the retention of records. To  minimize clerical errors and provide with checks and balances.    2. The ENL team will be trained on the CR Part 154, the Steps within the ELL identification process, recordkeeping, student  enrollment statuses, and the collection, processing and record-keeping of the parent surveys and program selections    3. ENL and bilingual teachers professional learning will focus on language acquisition, best practices for co-teaching,  integrating language and content instruction for ELLs, among many other instructional strategies. Additionally, they will receive  training on administering the NYSESLAT exam, and using data to guide instruction. We have a 6-week PLC specifically for  teachers of ELLs, on making the curriculum accessible for ELLs, will support teachers in developing a repertoire of best practice  and strategies to utilize when planning and teaching effective lessons.    4. School administrators and all classroom teachers will receive at least 5.25 hours of professional learning on language  acquisition and the varying needs of ELLs.  They will also receive support in providing ELL students with targeted RTI supports  to improve academic performance.     ELL teachers will receive PDs on accessing the tools on EngageNY in order to better support ELLs in engaging with the Common  Core Learning Standards. Additionally, Southern Cross consultants will provide teachers of ELLS with ongoing classroom  coaching targeting instructional practices that will help them meet the needs of their ELL students in meeting the Common  Core Learning Standards.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The P.S. 9 professional development plan for ELL personnel is a living document, and it is a comprehensive one that will  include, school administrators, the ENL Team, school secretaries, ENL and bilingual teachers and all teachers.    1. School secretaries will be trained on the incoming process of new students to determine student enrollment status and  steps that must be followed.

Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   As per the UFT contract teachers of ELLs may use Tuesday afternoons from 2:20pm-3:10pm to meet and outreach with  parents. During these times, parents will be invited at least once a year to meet with individual teachers to discus the student's  language development progress, and assessment results. If a translator is necessary, the classroom teacher will discuss with  the Parent Coordinator to be able to secure a qualified interpreter/translator in the home language. The ENL, team will also be  on hand to answer any questions related to the proficiency assessment results and to  provide parents with guidance in ways  parents can continue to support student learning at home.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We have found that some of the most involved parents in our school are parents of ELL student. Attention is given to increase  parent involvement of all students. For the ELL parents, interests and responsibilities also include their children's acquisition of  a new language, while growing the literacy of the home language.  ELL parents are also trying to navigate their way in a new  country. With this understanding, P.S.9 offers support to parents in many ways. P.S. 9 has installed a lighted information  billboard that is cemented into the ground near the school entrance. Parents now look to timely school announcements that  are continuously updated.    The parent coordinator coordinator outreaches to parents of ELLs to provide them support with accessing information about  academic expectations, student progress and ways in which they can support their children. She coordinates community  events at school, such as a Halloween family event, Thanksgiving Dinner, and field trip to the NYS English Language Learner  Parent Conference at NYU. The parent coordinator is bilingual, and is able to provide translations in Spanish. Parents are  informed that they may contact the parent coordinator if they need any translation of school communication to any other  language other than Spanish.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jacqueline Bailey, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Ryer Avenue Elementary School                                                                              School DBN: 10X009  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      A Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is completed by a parent/guardian of every new  student who is enrolled at P. S. 9. If a parent identifies a home language other than English, then there is a  student interview between the licensed pedagogue and the student. The survey helps us identify the predominant  language spoken at home, and the preferred oral and written language of communication. Both at the beginning  and throughout the school year, we use data from various ATS reports, such as the RHLA and RPOB, to identify the  home language and place of birth of the P. S. 9 student body. The RPOB lists home languages of all students. We  also use the Student Emergency Contact cards completed at the beginning of the year to help us identify the  preferred home language. This information, coupled with teacher knowledge of languages spoken by parents and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84      guardians, assist in identifying written translation and interpretation needs of the school. Data collected on the  Language Allocation Policy will also help guide this determination.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      The school staff has been trained on the use of the language line and the three-Step flyer to access the various types  of languages. Each classroom teacher receives the students’ preferred home language to keep as part of their  emergency folder. In case of an emergency parents will be contacted by school staff personnel who speak the  predominant preferred languages of either English or Spanish, which are our predominant home languages. Any other  home languages we will use the interpretation line to request for an interpreter.      Classroom teachers use ClassDojo as a means to communicate with parents, and through ClassDojo, communication is  translated into the desired language. ClassDojo sends text message alerts to families, therefore we can communicate  with families quickly. We also plan to use K-12 Alerts in order to be able to communicate via text, email or phone  messages to be able to reach out to parents in both English and Spanish.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      A copy of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 will be given to all staff members at the beginning of each school year.  The school will also plan a PD where the School Language Access Coordinator and possibly the Field Language Access  Coordinator will train school staff on the various language resources available to them. Such as three-way calling  interpreters, ordering on-site interpreters and requesting documents to be translated.       School personnel will also receive a packet with phone numbers, scripts, and surveys to express support needed for  seamless and ongoing translation and interpretation services for families.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is a directive on the responsibility that our school system is committed to equal access  to all rights, opportunity, information, and participation of LEP parents in our school. A parent will never be denied  access to opportunities afforded their families, or to children enrolled at P. S. 9. As a result of these regulations, P. S. 9  has developed systems that will meet the needs of parents of ELLs who speak the predominant second language,  Spanish, and less prevalent languages represented in our school, such as Arabic, Bengali, Mandinka, Nepali, and Twi.    Additionally, Item B of Section VII in the Chancellor's Regulations relates to the conspicuous posting of DOE covered  languages for translation.
