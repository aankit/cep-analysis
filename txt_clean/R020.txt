This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our vision is to strive towards excellence while reaching for proficiency.    Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to create a school that provides the highest quality educational services and opportunities to all  students and personnel in a safe, caring and healthy environment.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We are working toward creating an environment where student achievement is attained through enriched  curriculum, clear communication, active parental and community support, and where there is a high degree of  professionalism and respect for diversity.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 20 is located in the Port Richmond section of Staten Island. Our community is predominantly Hispanic , with the  majority being Mexican. Spanish is the dominant language spoken in the home. Our school currently has 218 (English  Language Learner (ELL) students which make up approximately 39% of our total school population.   Our collaboration with El Centro de Hospitalidad, Make the Road and Wagner College have provided opportunities for  our ELL students and their families. Through our collaboration with Wagner College and the College of Staten Island,  we receive several student teachers and student observers whose studies include English as a New Language (ENL)  and Special Education throughout the year. In addition, Wagner College students host a Breakfast Club for P.S. 20  students in order to boost attendance. Visiting artists from the Metropolitan Opera, Staten Island Arts and Sundog  Theater work with students throughout the year. New York Cares and New York City Food Bank are collaborating  organizations that help to assist in the growth of our children, socially, emotionally, and academically.      We currently house the United Activities Unlimited (UAU) after school program throughout the year. This program is  K-5 and offers homework assistance and academic enrichment through art, science, social studies and math. We offer  test prep after school programs for our students in grades 3-5 from February through May and ENL enrichment  programs for our K-2 students as well. We also, provided Reading Rescue to at-risk students in grade 1.   We offer visual arts, movement through dance and theatre arts. Our visual arts cluster teacher puts on an art show  that is recognized in the Staten Island Advance newspaper and family art nights throughout the year for families to  attend. Families have the opportunity to browse through their children’s work and create projects alongside them in  the evening sessions. All grade levels are involved in participating in performances throughout the year with our  theatre cluster teacher. There is a culminating “Broadway style” show at the end of the year. We also hold monthly  student of the month assemblies where classes and individual students perform to showcase their work in class or  highlight our monthly celebrated character trait.   The school utilizes a school wide behavior management program called Class Dojo. This is a PBIS system in which the  teacher is able to award points for positive behaviors and take away points for negative behaviors. This is immediately  visible to parents through an app that is downloaded to their phones and, also allows for parents and teachers to  communicate with each other via a messaging feature.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our population of ELL students (39%) and Special Needs students (38%) continue to increase over the years. Using  quality ENL (English as a New Language) pedagogy, curricula, and providing quality professional development that  instills the necessary skills for our ELL students and teachers is a fundamental focus at our school. Recognizing the  deficit for these students in vocabulary, our focus continues to be on vocabulary development for all students. In  addition, we provide parents of these students, many of whom are illiterate in their own language as well, with  opportunities to attend parent workshops and English as a New Language (ENL) classes that will help them learn  English and in turn, help their children.   In response to parent interest we have opened a Dual Language Program and are expanding the program to  encompass Kindergarten and First grade this year. In this program both Engilsh Language Learners and Second  Language Learners interact and provide positive language models for each other both in English and Spanish. We have   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      partaken in professional development to increase teacher pedagogy on how to develop bilingual, biliterate and  bicultural students.   We have integrated collaborative team teaching classes on each grade level as well as self-contained special  education classes on each grade to meet the individual needs of our students with individualized Education plans  (IEP)’s. We continue to seek out opportunities to provide our Special Ed teachers and paraprofessionals with  Professional Development.   Our curriculum supports critical thinking and inquiry based learning to foster independence and higher order thinking  skills. Our students learn problem solving skills through hands on learning.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 20 has been focusing on teachers working collaboratively to develop units of study aligned to Common Core  Learning Standards (CCLS) horizontally and vertically. We have made good progress in this area by establishing  teacher grade leaders and programming common planning time that allows teachers the opportunity to work  together. Using the Danielson Framework, teachers are providing more rigorous instruction. We have made great  improvements in our school goal of fostering independence and growing academic vocabulary and are building  guided reading practices to better meet the individual needs of students. Through work with the Core Collaborative  we are working towards removing scaffolds and students taking ownership over their learning. Teachers are partaking  in professional development surrounding Universal Design for Learning, as well as in student and teacher efficacy in  order to better provide multiple entry points and provide opportunities for high levels of engagement for all students.  We are making progress towards student ownership of the assessment process. Teachers have are implementing self  and peer assessment strategies in the classroom as well as building upon understandings of next steps. Designated a  Respect for All school, we continue to provide special programs and work through our Guidance Counselor.   Our instructional foci surround collaborative planning, questioning and discussion techniques, vocabulary  development and coherent planning for instruction to improve both teacher pedagogy and student outcomes.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R020   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   464   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

A review of teacher performance in Advance, learning walk observations and formal and informal measures of  student performance, indicates that students are still experiencing difficulties in demonstrating higher order thinking  skills and partaking in meaningful classroom discussions.   A review, of the 2017-2018 Quality Review indicates the need for improvement in the area of questioning and  discussion as measured by Danielson component 3B. There is also an indication that some classroom discussions  remain primarily between the teacher and select students. It was noted that ELL's and SWD's were not consistently  engaged in tasks and there was limited peer to peer discussion.   The 2017-2018 Quality Review indicates:   Strengths     Curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous habits and higher-order skills for most students.     Performance task rubrics are planned and refined using assessment data and previous student work.   Weaknesses      Many lessons are teacher directed with limited opportunities for students to turn and talk and work with   partners and/or group     Questions are often superficial or requires only one word answers     In classes where students were working in groups, the groups were not able to fully articulate the work they  were doing.

Review of the 2107-2018 Quality Review indicates that the principal consistently communicates high expectations  around teaching and learning to entire school staff based on effective lesson planning and utilizing actionable  feedback to help improve student work.    Strengths     Across classrooms, teachers provide both written and verbal feedback to students that are aligned to the   school's curricula. There are performance tasks, running records, and teacher-created common assessments  used to determine student progress towards goals in most subjects. As a result, students understand what is  expected of them in relation to established success criteria and how to move towards mastery. In turn,  students are more willing to speak to their work and share their thoughts and opinions with their peers.     Classrooms have begun to use the Sown to Grow platform along with progressions to allow students to self   assess and peer assess their work. Students have expressed that this process allows them to see exactly  where they fall and what they need to do to improve upon their work.   Weaknesses      It was noted that the engagement of ELLs and SWDs in appropriately challenging tasks, was not consistent  across all classrooms.     As a result of limited student to student discussions, work products did not always reflect high levels of   student thinking, engagement and participation.  Small group instruction was not consistently seen across all classrooms.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 20 Port Richmond School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 20 Port Richmond School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;          Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Currently there are 7 EN's, 5 EM's, 14 TR's and 5 EX in  Kindergarten; 2 EN's, 9 EM's, 9 TR's, 13 EX's and 2 CM's in first grade, 0 EN's, 5 EM's,  14 TR's, 8 EX's and 1 CM in 2nd grade; 1 EN, 2 EM, 8 TR's, 25 EX's and 18 CM's in third  grade; 1 EN, 2 EM's, 12 TR's, 13 EX's and 9 CM's in fourth grade; and 1 EN, 3 TR's, 19  EX's and 3 CM's in fifth grade. Historically, the majority of ELL's in the school are in the early  grades therefore, ELL's and ELLSWD's falling in the Transitioning and Expanding ranges in  grades 1, 2, and 3 will receive targeted  differentiated small group instruction in an After School  Program.  Approximately 100 students, falling in the expanding and transitioning levels of  proficiency, will be serviced in 8 classes of approximately 12 students per class, meeting twice a  week for two hours each session.  Each class will be facilitated by one teacher. This will run on  Wednesdays and Thursdays for approximately 13 weeks beginning the week of January 9th and  ending April 18th.  Classes will be created by NYSESLAT grade bands and, small group  instruction will be appropriately differentiated based on the students' level of English Language  Proficiency on the most current NYSESLAT administered.  ESL and bilingually certified  teachers will provide student instruction through collaboration with common branch certified  teachers as required. Comprehensible input, opportunities for verbal discussion, use of  contextualized language, and opportunities for involvement in the classroom will be included as  part of instruction.  Second language learning will be facilitated by teachers using Big Books,  songs and guided reading books that are distinct instructional materials from daily instruction  and incorporate the following:  - Modeled talk- teachers will use gestures, visuals and demonstrations     -Vocabulary and reading- students will read extensively in English supplemented by text in  native language where needed.  Lessons will include read alouds, echo reading, choral reading,  guided reading, native language literature and open book  discussion.  Students will also engage in role play activities and readers' theater to  expand their oral language and fluency skills.       -Students will develop graphophonemic awareness which contributes greatly to children's ability  to read words both in isolation and connected texts.  A culminating performance of shorts skits will take place to celebrate students'  work with parents.    Notices regrarding program eligibility will be sent home to parents in their preferred  language.  Parents will be required to submit a tear-off indicating whether or not they will enroll  their children in the program.  Enrollment records will be maintained by  administration.  Teachers will take daily attendance and submit it to the administrator in charge.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                 Current trends indicate that the number of ELLs is increasing amongst the early grade levels.  Data analysis and school needs assessment indicates a need for increased Professional  Development to improve teacher effectiveness.  Due to heterogeneous class configurations,  professional development is needed for both Title III program teachers and instructional staff  across all grades and curriculum areas.  Professional Development opportunities will be provided  once a month, in-house at P.S. 20 during Monday's 80 minute professional development time  after school over the course of .  PD's will continue to go further in depth as to meet the  continued instructional foci of the school as well as the needs of new teachers.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Literacy skills are assessed using Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessments as well as in-house teacher created assessments  with focus on fluency and phonemic awareness.  Assessments allows us to pinpoint where students weakness & stregths  fall.  Data has shown that our ELL's require additional supports in the areas of comprehension, vocabulary development and  phonemic awareness.  An emphasis is placed on teaching comprehension skills/strategies, opportunities to expand prior  knowledge, to expose children to a wider range of vocabulary.  Data also indicates that our younger students are more  proficient in speaking than in reading and writing.  Likewise, our older students are more proficient in listening and speaking  than in reading and writing.  for this reason, the emphasis of our instructional program shifts from strengthening oral language  and building its connections to text, to strengthening reading comprehension and building its connections to written   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      responses.  Syntax, structure, figuarative language, idioms and unusual vocabulary are all considered as teachers plan an  integrated curriculum .  Academic language is developed through the use of non-fiction texts and through opportunities to  maniplulate, categorize and classify real world items.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  During Inquiry periods and common planning time we evaluate all pertinent data to determine what gaps may need  addressing during instruction.  Benchmark assessments and in class progress checks are analyzed as are end of unit  assessments and performance tasks across all academic areas. Teachers also analyze the previous years State  Assessment  Results to guide instruction for ELLs.  ELL-SWD students' IEP's are analyzed and reffered to ensure that their goals  are being addressed and progress is being made.  All changes to services and instruction are made accordingly to the individual  needs of the students.  As a school we look at the progress made as a whole as well as across the various modalities on the  NYSESLAT to determine the effectiveness of the ENL program.  Our ELL's typically perform well in the area of math meeting the  AYP however, in ELA while progress is being made the AYP's are met through the Safety Harbor of the Science test.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Classroom and ENL teachers meet to discuss students' summative data and plan differentiated instruction within the  classroom to meet student needs.  Should more assistance be needed the students are discussed at the PPT meeting and  possible interventions are discussed and planned.  We have 3 bilingual speech therapists to assist students with language  processing needs, a bilingual OT to address fine motor needs, and a bilingual Psychologist and Social Worker to perform  evaluations should a full referral be necessary.  We also have an AIS teacher that provides reading services to students in need.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Benchmark assessments for initial placement into groups is done using the Fountas and Pinell Benchmark Assessment  System.  After benchmarks have been performed the teacher progress monitor through the use of running records and reading  conferencing to assess student progress, modify student grouping and inform instruction.  This is done until the next  benchmark window opens.  Similar procedures are done with math instruction as well.  Teachers give a beginning of year  assessment and perform progress monitoring as well as end of unit assessments to determine student needs.  Teachers use in  classroom progress checks to assess student progress.  Utilizing this data they then group students into the various Tiers of  RtI.  Teachers continuously monitor student progress and scaffold instruction based on student need.  ELL's have the benefit of  the ENL teacher in their classroom to allow for the provision of Tier I instruction in a smaller student to teacher ratio as well  Tier II intervention where needed.  Students are also discussed at the RtI team meetings to determine additional RtI services if  necessary as well as to provide teachers with additional strategies to benefit the instruction of ELL's in the classroom.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data has shown that our ELL's require additional supports in the areas of comprehension, vocabulary development and  phonemic awareness.  An emphasis is placed on teaching comprehension skills/strategies, opportunities to expand prior  knowledge, to expose children to a wider range of vocabulary.  Data also indicates that our younger students are more  proficient in speaking than in reading and writing.  Likewise, our older students are more proficient in listening and speaking  than in reading and writing.  for this reason, the emphasis of our instructional program shifts from strengthening oral language  and building its connections to text, to strengthening reading comprehension and building its connections to written  responses. In the past student performance on the NYSESLAT has indicated that students follow typical second language  acquisition patterns developing quicker in the areas of listening and speaking with reading and writing taking longer to become  proficient.  Our students often fall in lower proficiency bands due to lower performance in either reading or writing.  Looking  at the overall performance of our students on the 2016  NYSESLAT it is evident that great strides were made in second  language acquisition.  Review of the 2017 NYSESLAT performance school wide shows that the majority of the students moved   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         from beginners (previous levels) requiring 360 minutes of service to expanding & transitioning requiring 180 minutes of  service.  NYSITELL performance of Kindergarten indicates that students are entering school with emerging English Language  skill. The majority of first grade students fall within the emerging and transitioning levels.  By second grade we are seeing more  transitioning and expanding  students.  In grades three through five the majority of students fall within the transitioning and  expanding ranges.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The LAP team meets monthly to look over the data and discuss findings and ensure that all students are receiving their  mandated services in accordance with their NYSITELL/NYSESLAT levels.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All ELL's are placed in heterogeneous classes.  They remain in their grade appropriate classrooms and ENL instruction  is delivered via the integrated model.  ENL services are provided by four ENL teachers who are assigned to specific  grades.  Each ENL teacher collaborates with classroom teachers to supplement and scaffold instuction and curriculum  accordingly. The ENL teachers schedule standalone periods to meet the needs of the ENtereing and  EMerging students accordingly.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The TBE program is one for SWD's.  The children are in a class with a bilingually certified teacher and bilingual  paraprofessional.  Students are grouped by functional levels as indicated on their IEPs in terms of language  proficiency.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The Dual Language Program is in its second year of inception at P.S. 20 and is an ICT DL class.  The program currently  serves grades K and 1.  Students are grouped heterogeneously in a 50/50 model of ELLs to non-ELLs.  The 60/40  General Education to Special Education ratio is also maintained.  Students receive instruction using the roller coaster  model, in which they receive 50% of their instruction in English and 50% of their instruction in Spanish.  The bilingually  certified teachers in the classroom provide the students with their ENL services in the classroom.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              2 ENL Teachers provide from 180 minutes for advanced ELLS  to 360 minutes for Beginner and Intermediate ELLs of  mandated instructional time per week.  Certified and blilungual licensed staff members provide mandated ESL instruction  within the classroom.  Teachers use ENL methodology to provide mandated ESL time as per students’ levels. Push-in teachers  will integrate ENL methodologies into content area lessons as well as ELA.  An administrator will supervise the NYSELAT Test Prep After School Program- the only after school program in session- in order  to insure student safety and rigor of instruction.  Bilingually certified special education teachers provide instruction to the TBE classes.  The students received between 180 to  360 minutes of ENL instrution and ENL methodologies are integrated into instruction throughout the day.  NLA is provided for  50% of the time.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Push-in teachers (ENL, TBE and Classroom/ Cluster teachers) collaborate and ENL teachers use ENL methodology to enhance  instruction in content areas.  The native language is used in the TBE class to deliver core content material.   In both TBE and  ENL programs methods used include scaffolding, total physical response, role playing, vocabulary enhancement, cognates,  graphic organizers, translation, thematic units, use of spelling dictionaries as well as integration of technology and the Arts.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Based on Home Language and NYSESLAT proficiency levels students are given access to content area exams in their native  language. Translations are made available as necessary.  Testing for special services are made based on eligiblity/need.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) Instructional plan for SIFE: Students’ proficiency levels are determined and students are exposed to grade level content at  their instructional level. Students are given additional ENL time and given opportunities to express themselves in Native  Language.  b) Newcomers:  Students will be given survival English skills, peer mediation, explicit instruction in Tier I vocabulary,  differentiated instruction and assessment (i.e. oral exams, exams with less writing, math lessons and exams are provided in  students native language). Students are automatically enrolled in extended day and after school programs.  ENL testing  accommodations are implemented.  c)  4-6 yrs.:  Students are provided with extra help in targeted skills that are deficient. Specific skills are then targeted and  monitored for progress. Based on results, small group instruction is provided. Students may be discussed at PPT meetings to  determine if additional services may be needed. The PRIM is utilized and interventions are implemented. Students are enrolled  in after school programs.  ENL testing accommodations are implemented.   d)  Long-term ELLs:  Students are provided with extra help in targeted skills that are deficient. Specific skills are then targeted  and monitored for progress. Based on results, small group instruction is provided. Students may be discussed at PPT meetings  to determine if additional services may be needed. The PRIM is utilized, students are given additional time and are enrolled in  after school programs.  ENL testing accommodations are implemented. Life skills are also addressed.   e)  Former ELLs:  Students are provided direct , via integrated instruction ENL services for  two years upon passing the  NYSESLAT.  The ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to provide them with ESL methodologies that may assist the  students in the classroom. Additionally, former ELLs are provided with ELL testing accommodations for two years past their  passing of the NYSESLAT.  These accommodations include extended time by 50%,  and use of bilingual dictionaries.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All students are programmed according to their IEPs.  Should a service not be available in the school RSAs are issued to ensure  that students have access to their mandated services.  Depending on the IEP recommendation students are provided with ENL  in the classroom according to their proficiency level.  There is a special education TBE program for students in grades K-3.  Students mandated for bilingual programs have alternate placement paras assigned to the classroom to assist with instruction  throughout the course of the day.   Leveled classroom libraries in both languages are made available to all classes. Dual  language texts and games are also provided,  the Reading Program (Reading Street in K-2, and ReadyGen in 3-5), Math  program (Go Math K-5) and Science Program (Science Fusion) contains ELL language intervention kits and ELL activitiy  guides.  Guided Reading component of the CORE contains differentiated books for ELL's, Elements of vocabulary is used to  develop accelerated language development. Strategies include repetition, re-definition, multi-sensory approaches and total  physical repsonse. All material is scaffolded as needed based on  student need.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Ell students with disabilities receive a variety of services dependent upon need including but not limited to SETTS speech  counseling, ICT classes, mainstreaming, inclusion in extra curricular activites, etc.  Contingent upon academic need  push in  services are provided during ELA and Math periods to support classroom instruction and students learning needs.  Related  service providers utilize pacing calendars to align instruction and therapy to student's needs.  Creative scheduling allows for  collaboration, intervention and redirection of instruction.  Services are recommended according to the continuum of services,  ELL status does not hinder the appropriate services from being recommended.  Students are programmed to have the most  exposure to LRE and their non-disabled peers as is appropriate to their need.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In grades K - 2 Pearson's Reading Street ELL supports are utilized to support ELA instruction, all materials directly coincide with  the phonics, word study and comprehension skills being taught to the entire class.  In grades 3-5  ReadyGen ELL Scaffolding  Guides  are utilized to enhance ELA instruction as well as Earobics (K-3), Fundations (K-2),  Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy  Intervention (K-5), ReadyGen Word Study (3-5). Math materials in Spanish are used along with Math intervention kits (Go  Math), Exploring Math-An Intervention and reinforcement resources. Other resources used for content areas are Theater’s  Workshop (Social Studies), Houghton Mifflin Harcourt ELL components (Science Fusion) All interventions are provided upon  students performance on regular in classroom progress checks, performance task and end of unit assessments.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In reviewing student performance on both State ELA and NYSESLAT assessments it has been determined that vocabulary  development and student schema are areas that need developing.  In order to do so NYSESLAT Preparation, Enrichment  Through the Arts, NY Cares volunteer Initiative Art, Sports and Culinary Explorers; Research is presently underway to  investigate research based ELL technology to utilize within the classroom, the in school Theatre program will be expanded,  there will be more arts incorporated into the instructional programming.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded the same opportunities as non ELL students, they are included in all school activities. All program notices and  invitations are sent home in Home Language  and English. After school programs include art enrichment, Math and ELA Test  Prep, and NYSESLAT Test Prep. During the day, selected ELL students participate in a theater club, choral program, dance and  art clubs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs?

You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    As a school we provide a multitude of opportunities for our students and parents that they otherwise might not experience;  activities include but are not limited to attending performances, visiting cultural institutions and museums throughout the city;  participating in visual art, music and drama programs; swim instruction for students; participation in Barnes and Noble's  My Own  Book program, participating in school spirit activities and parent and student leadership programs.  These activities enhance  student's background knowledge, vocabulary and motivation which enable them to make real world connections to a variety of  content areas.  It also helps to build a sense of community which therefore promotes a sense of empowerment and ownership.  An  increase of bilingual staff has assisted in improving positive communication between school and home which has led to a greater  sense of community.  The involvement of parents of ELL's has increased dramatically over the past few years, thereby placing an  emphasis on the importance and value of education.                                                                                              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marie Munoz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 20                                                                              School DBN: 31R020  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
