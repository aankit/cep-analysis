The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      At Mott Hall High School, we believe that our students learn best when their individual social, emotional, and  academic needs are known and addressed to prepare them to become lifelong learners and independent thinkers.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The school has an established culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and  families, and provides supports to achieve expectations. Systems, procedures, and instructional strategies are some of  the areas inclusive of the professional learning opportunities offered to the staff in order to make significant progress  towards the school goals, increase teacher effectiveness, academic rigor, instructional practice, attendance  improvement, and parental involvement; increase credit accumulations in all grade levels, increase overall Regents  passing rate, increase the four years graduation rate, use data more effectively to monitor student progress, use data  analysis to drive and monitor the impact of instructional decisions and differentiation, support family understanding  of high expectations, and communicate to students the importance of their development and academic success. All  teaching staff displays exemplary student work with task, grade earned, and next steps along with a rubric.    Following the content related curriculum, teachers design ten- twelve units of instruction along with lesson plans that  support students’ needs. Differentiation in the classroom includes SmartBoard (one in each classroom including the  library), laptops, student grouping, and additional resources to support lessons. Teachers are making progress in  differentiating instruction to meet individual student’s needs; not all teaching staff has developed skills in this area. In  co-teaching classes, teachers take turns leading instruction and addressing small groups or individual students to  provide assistance, guidance, and keep them focused. The school focus is on literacy since it is an integral part of  academic success and college and career readiness. Teachers are encouraged to implement reading, writing, and  vocabulary building on a daily basis on all their classes to properly prepare students to be ready for college courses  and career preparedness which is part of the learning process.    The school has daily professional learning communities, which includes department and grade level meetings, inquiry  team focused on cohort and credit accumulation, and school-wide teacher/administration selected topics based on  observations and suggestions. Department heads and teachers present a great part of the professional learning topics  selected and the department heads meet regularly with administration and Network members to address the school  areas of concerns. The students receive high level of support in their academic advancement. The guidance team  ensures that Student are provided with exploratory experiences. The students receive assistance on college essay  writing, college trips, tutoring, mentoring, financial aid workshops, and guest speakers for students and parents as  well.    Individual and groups of students with particular needs are identified to provide support and promote positive effects  on their achievement. Assessment by the English as a New Language and Special Need students’ teachers identifies  the need for additional support to meet their needs. All the teaching staff use their school laptop to access web-based  data and online resources. Credit recovery, after school, and Saturday academy provide additional time for academic  intervention and to meet the needs of identified under performing students. Additionally, the school provides  students with cheer leading, band, community service, student government, helping hands, Honor Society, volleyball,  , co-ed golf, basketball, and baseball teams. Additionally, our school has a poetry club, an art club, a newspaper club, a  knitting/crocheting club, Gay-Straight Alliance, among others, providing our students with additional opportunities to  become involved in the school community.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      The school partners with the following organizations: Monroe College (Jump-start), Harlem Children’s Zone, Kechie’s  Project, Urban Scholars, US National Guard      3.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  By February 2019, as a result of all staff focusing on improving parental outreach, there will be a 3% increase in  parental involvement in school-wide events, meetings, and activities, as measured by Parent Coordinator Activity  Report (PCAR) during the period of September 2018 to February 2019, compared to Parent Coordinator Activity  Report (PCAR) during the period of September 2017 to February 2018.   A review of the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) during the period of September 2018 to February 2019,  compared to Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) during the period of September 2017 to February 2018  reflects the following:   From September 2018 to February 2019, there were 273 parents in attendance at parent workshops and parent  conferences.   From September 2017 to February 2018, there were 441 parents in attendance at parent workshops and parent  conferences.   This represents a decline of 163 parents in attendance at school-wide events, meetings, and activities. We did not  meet our February progress monitoring goal of increasing parental involvement by 3%.   Our next SCEP action steps will include the following:   A sub-committee will be created and charged with the mission of developing meaningful parent activities and  engaging in enhanced family outreach.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52         amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Mott Hall, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Mott Hall will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   Our teachers communicate learning expectations as well as academic progress to families. Teachers have the last 30  minutes of each day available to communicate with families or to set up meeting with caregivers to create action  plans to ensure student success. Furthermore, our teachers will use Skedula to record student attendance, and  academic progress while at the same time our parents will be trained on the use of Skedula so that they can  communicate with teachers directly, check their child's attendance, and follow their academic progress.      In addition, Mott Hall High School will host monthly workshops and presentations for our families in partnership with  the NYPD, Fire Department, and other community organizations to build community. The Mott Hall High School  Parent Association will work closely with our Parent Coordinator to ensure that the programming is consistent with  community needs. Additionally the Parent Coordinator will send regular communications to our families informing  them of the events that are taking place with in the school.       For the 2017-2018 the Mott Hall is planning the following workshops/presentations for our families:     How to use Skedula and the DOE parent system    Graduation requirements (per grade level)    How to read your child's transcript    Transition to High School    Transition to College: How to file for fafsa    Transition to College: What you need to know as a parent      CPR Workshop    Get ready for college! What do you need to do each year of high school    Attendance: Why is it important?    How to prevent bullying   Fire Safety Workshop   Additionally Mott Hall High School will continue to have holiday gathering for our families, like our Thanksgiving  Dinner.          Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56         In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

Our supplemental after school program targets those  students who did not receive a commanding or passing score in the NYSESLAT. Based on these  metrics, the program serves 53 students in grades 9 through 12 and all instruction is done in  English in order to promote expeditious growth in language acquisition. The 53 students  receiving services are divided in the following subgroups: entering, emerging, transitions, and  expanding. Additionally, students with interrupted education will be offered small group  instruction focused on addressing skills and strategies to help them become acclimated to being a  student and to address their educational deficiencies. To supplement instruction, teachers will use  workbooks, iPads, laptops, electronic translators, dictionaries, and headsets. Software like  Rosetta Stone and Learner Pal, Light Sail will also be used by the teachers to supplement  instruction. Aside from the ENL teacher, who will participate in all supplemental program  sessions, there will be one ELA teacher, one Math teacher, one Science teacher, and one Social  studies teacher. The schedule for the supplemental program and targeted groups is as follows:    Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday 3:38–4:38  ENL/ELA Entering and Emerging  Science/ ENL All Students Receiving ELL Services  Math/ENL All Students Receiving ELL Services  Social Studies/ENL  All Students Receiving ELL Services 4:38–5:38  ENL/ELA Entering  ENL/ELA Emerging  ENL/ELA Transitioning  ENL/ELA Expanding  The program runs from October 2rd, 2018 to June 7th, 2019 Monday through Thursday and it  consists of 238 1-hour sessions. The program requires 1 ENL teacher and 4 content specific  teachers. The ENL teacher will co-teach with the content area teacher and differentiate  instruction based on students’ English proficiency. After the content area support, the ENL  teacher will host sessions concentrating on English acquisition targeting specific groups.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             Rationale:  Staff development is an ongoing process in our school. Designed as workshops, these meetings  are intended to build an understanding of the cultural, linguistic and instructional needs  impacting the English Language Learners as well as helping to bridge the gap impacting the  English Language Learners with Disabilities. At Mott Hall High School, staff development takes  place through daily seminars, intervisitations, institutes, collegial support groups, hands-on  activities, multimedia, case study reviews, and small group discussion. We also take advantage  of outside professional development and literacy workshops as they become available through  the District and/or Network at no extra cost to the program. Because all teachers at Mott Hall are  considered teachers of ELLs, they all receive professional development in the Title III Direct  Instruction program. The ESL Coordinator provides professional development during common  planning time to the staff on “Best Practices for ELL students.” The professional developments  are targeted to meet the needs of our teachers, they are well planned and ongoing as we obtain  feedback from teachers to assess their needs in meeting the demands of our ELLs. In addition,  content area teachers are supported through one-on-one meetings with the ELL Coordinator,  through the discussions of Data using the EDAT Tool, as well as through formal and informal  weekly meeting of an Inquiry Team that focuses on the ELLs considered at risk. Derivative of  our Professional Development, action plans are created utilizing instructional strategies for  ELLs.    Teachers to Receive Training:    All teachers during professional development time.    Schedule and Duration:  All workshops to take place at Mott hall High School will take one or two professional  development periods.    1.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Mott Hall High School utilizes a variety of assessments, including Pearson Periodic Assessment, teacher assessment, regents,  NYSESLAT,  Baron's Rgents Prep online, and baseline assessments that guide instruction.  These assessments have shown that  the students lack academic English vocabulary that enhibits them from passing exams.  While they often understand the  concepts taught, the lack of   vocabulary causes students to perform poorly in content area exams.  This can be seen in the low regents passing grades in the  school.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70       In order to address this issue, the school has implemented a variety of interventions that will help students succeed which  includes:   Saturday Academy, after school tutoring, in school pull out, and weekly checkin's with guidance counselor, and ELL  coordinator for   updates on progress.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ELL programs in the school are evaluated by a variety of measures including, but not limited to, standadized  test (NYSESLAT, content regents exams, etc.), periodic assessment, perent/teacher/student feedback, and overall report  grades and content level proficiency.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns in the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL show that Mott Hall serves a diverse ELL population. Of the 52 ELLs enrolled at  Mott Hall: 16 are expanding; 10 are transitioning; and 10 are emerging. Four of the beginner students are newcomers and  scored beginner in all four modalities. This indicates that there is work to be done across all 4 modalities with our newly  arrived students. Our intermediate and advanced ELLs consistently perform better in the areas of speaking and listening than  reading and writing. Teachers use this information to guide curricular choices and daily lesson planning.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Based on the NYSESLAT scores and as per CR Part 154.2 Mott Hall High School follows both heterogeneous by grade  level, and heterogeneous by proficiency level, during the standalone periods. These classes are in a stand alone model  to ensure students get the support they need. We use a pullout program. The ESL teacher pulls the students out of  their classes and instructs them in ESL. Where applicable, the ESL teacher also pushes in during classroom instruction.  Once a student reaches the proficiency level as per the NYSESLAT exam, teachers collaborate and a decrease in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         service level is provided. Though all students’ schedules at the school are individually programmed, the 9th and 10th  grade ELL’s generally travel as a block to their core courses, with the exception of a few advanced ELL’s.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?             Mott Hall High School adheres to mandated number of instructional minutes as required by the CR 154.  All ELL Students  are served with the mandated number of instructional minutes according to their proficiency levels, which are determined by  the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT. Entering students receive 540 minutes per week, emerging students receive 360 minutes per  week, and transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of ENL per week, as per CR Part 154 regulations.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     The ELL teacher provides content area support and uses strategies such as extensive use of visuals, repetition to promote oral  language development and content-area ESL instruction related to mathematics, social studies and science. Core content is  delivered in English and supports native lnaguage. Instruction is differentiated so that all students can access core curriculum  through a workshop reading and writing model, which is alligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Scaffolding  strategies are infused into the instruction of our ELL students. An integrated instructional program includes numerous  opportunities for our ELL students to develop writing skills, linguistic development and become successful users of  English.  Audio equipment gives our Ells more practice with listening skills, in conversation, improves comprehension,  conversation and develops fluency. ELLs are provided with Native Language instruction through the use of multicultural  classroom libraries and have access to supplemental educational materials that are aligned to the core curriculum.  The use  of  technology, smart board and laptop cart is readily available for all Ells. All Freestanding content-area classrooms also use  the Workshop Model.  Small group instruction consisting of 15 students or less is possible at Mott Hall High School due to the  leveled programming available to our Ells.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      At Mott Hall ELLs are appropriately evaluated whenever possiple  in their native language in content- areas (i.e.  Mathemathics, Science and Social studies. Teachers are provided with a list of all ELLs in their classes and are informed of the  need tof the individual student through wrokshops, email and other communications. All necessary arrangements are made to  accommodate ELLs who need them whether  formal (Regents) or informal (teacher made tests).        In addition  to the availability of the test in their native language when possible, testing accommodations for ELLS include:  Time Extention  in all exams and all subject areas  Separate location   Biligual dictionaries and glossaries                  5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a. For SIFE students we provide additional support based on the needs of the student. For example, we have set up after- school homework help, individual tutors and peer-tutors to help with the re-entry of Students with Interrupted Formal  Education. This is accomplished with the help of the New York University students who take part in the America Reads  program. Additionally, the school employs a full-time guidance counselor and social worker. They are available for SIFE  students to receive on-site counseling.  b. ELLs in the US for less than three years receive the same Reading Workshop, Wrting Workshop, and testing preparation as  main streamed students in their grade because they are required to take the math and science tests. Additionally, they are  required to take the ELA test once they have been in the country for a year. The newcomers are constantly observed and  conference notes are kept on each individual student and reviewed by the ELL teacher and the classroom teacher. Most of the  ELL students qualify for and are included in the school’s Academic Intervention Program. They receive additional instruction  with the academic intervention providers. Classroom teachers, the intervention providers and the ELL teacher meet regularly  to discuss their program of instruction. Steps are taken accordingly to support individual instruction. A comprehensive  assessment of students’ class work, statewide mathematics test results, and attendance will determine whether or not ELLs  enrolled for between two and three years will be promoted. Promotion criteria in ELA will be set on the New York State English  as a Second Language achievement test (NYSESLAT) after the New York State Education Department releases progress targets.  c. When students are receiving ELL services for 4 to 6 years, extensive academic intervention is provided in vocabulary. Our  extended day program and Saturday Academy progrom also addresses academic intervention for these students for an  additional 100 minutes per week. The ENL teacher continues to provide a structured program in vocabulary instruction.  d. We have many Long-Term ELLs  that have come to our school as ELL from juior high school as well as from other countries  and the promotion standards apply to English language learners (ELLs) who have been in an English language school system for  three or more years unless they have an approved extension of services for year four or five. We provide additional support  based on the needs of the student. For example, we have an extended day program; seek individual tutors and credit recovery  for students to make up any missing credit needed to graduate.  e. Former ELLs receive testing modifications for two years after English proficiency. Additionally, they are eligible to receive 90  minutes per week of integrated ENL.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ENL strategies and approaches such as Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience Approach, Graphic organizers, and  Cooperative Learning are also used. Technology is an integral part of the long term ELLs plan. Computers are used for  multimedia projects, accessing information, word processing, publishing, reading and drills. Computer programs have also  proven to be valuable resources for introducing or reinforcing content area concepts and augmenting English language skills.  Teachers of ELL-SWD use appropriate strategies and grade level materials that both provide academic content areas and  accelerate English language development such as ESL methodologies , extensive use of visuals, repetition to promote oral  language and content area ESL instructional program.  In addition the use of technology, smart board and laptop cart is readily  available for all ELLs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  At Mott all, in order to better serve our ELL-SWDs, we have made modifications to our curricula and our instructional practice  to ensure that our ELL-SWD population receive the assistance needed so that they may be able to understand the work  presented, be engaged in conversations,  and group activities in order to develop their academic and social skills.  Additionally,  students are provided with support services such as:  SETSS, collaborative team teaching, ESL instruction, pull-out, peer  tutoring, one-on-one tutoring, after school tutoring, and Saturday academy to ensure their academic growth and college and  career readiness.  Academic Intervention and Support Services  Mott Hall High School’s Student Intervention Team holds meetings daily to discuss students who have been referred by       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      teachers as exhibiting need for academic interventions or other support services, such as ESL.  The committee is composed of  the guidance counselors, the social worker, the special education coordinator, and the ELL coordinator.  In addition, students  are provided with after school tutoring and enrichment and Saturday academy in order to prepare the students for regents  exams.   Students will also receive more native language support through texts in the native language to support content  understanding, and they will be taught how to use the native language resources available to them, such as bilingual  dictionaries and glossaries, to assist them during Regents exams.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   At Mott Hall High School’s, our Student Intervention Team holds meetings daily to discuss students who have been referred by  teachers as exhibiting need for academic interventions or other support services, such as ESL and/or ELL-SWD.  The committee  is composed of the guidance counselors, the social worker, the special education coordinator, and the ELL coordinator.  In  addition, students are provided with after school tutoring and enrichment and Saturday academy in order to prepare the  students for regents exams.   Students will also receive more native language support through texts in the native language to  support content understanding. Based on the ELA, mathematics, science, and social core curriculum, instruction will be  focused on the areas in which ELL students demonstrate the greatest need for improvement as determined by their NYSESLAT  scores and IEP goals. Additional opportunities will be provided for students to participate in scaffolded project-based learning,  using rubrics (for self-regulation/to check work), multisensory and multicultural materials, through cooperative groups in the  aforementioned areas of concern. Our school has many multi-lingual staff members who provide support to a student, when  the child does not understand.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       In order to continue to provide ELL students with support, this upcoming 2015-2017 years ELL students will attend Saturday  academy and enrichment.  This program will allow students to review for their content level classes and prepare for the state  regents exam.  In addition, a new technology enriched ELL curriculum will be followed in order to provide students with hands  on assess to technology and prepare them for college and beyond.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    None of the programs that were offered last year will be discontinued.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  After School Clubs and Services  Mott Hall High School offers all students several options for academic and non-academic extracurricular activities. They include  After School Academy for ELL's to improve on language and literacy development--Students are afforded the opportunity to  earn or recover academic course credit where as ELL's are able to make up work that will allow them to graduate. Saturday  Regents Prep –courses are also offered for the three consecutive Saturdays prior to the January and June NYS Regent  Examinations. ELL's are being presented with handouts during classroom periods and daily reminders over the loud speaker as  well as from the ELL teacher. Through the school’s partnership with CCNY’s Urban Scholars, students are provided with 1:1  tutoring sessions.  ELL's are able to use this setting to get one on one support in their home language. MHHS also offers non- academic activities such as student clubs, team sports, band and service learning activities. Our ELL's are always encouraged to  participate in these programs to enhance your communication skills by working amongst their peers.  Mott Hall High School After School Clubs and Program:    Mott Hall High School Band/Music Instruction – Mott Hall High School has partnered with the Multicultural Music Group  (MMG) to offer the students of MHHS music instruction and band practice. Students receive small group and one-on-one  instruction from professional musicians.     Streets to Scholars Saturday Program – This program targets students who are experiencing academic and/or social difficulty in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      school.   The program is comprised of basketball tournaments, peer mentoring, career counseling and guest speakers.     Urban Scholars Extended Day Program – Provides academic support to students in need of tutorial assistance, homework help  and exam preparation for NYS Regents subject exams and SAT.  Five ELL students participated in this program.     Kechie's Project INC.- This is an acadmeic empowerment program for students and provides resources and support services  to  encourage academic success. This is a non-profect organization. The Founder and President Nkechi Ogbodo came from  Nigeria and speaks to children from different cultures and backgrounds such as our ELL's. She comes once a week and exposes  them to the importance of academic and higher level education.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used at Mott Hall High School all meet New York State curriculum requirements and standards.  The  scaffolding and ESL instructional methods used to teach these materials by both the classroom and ESL instructor support the  learning of ELLs.  In addition, materials are procured in native language versions when available.  These are to be used by ELLs  in addition to the English versions.  ELLs are also provided with bilingual dictionaries, as well as native language glossaries and  texts where available.  Classroom teachers employ a variety of technology including smartboards and labtop computers. Books  and materials in the classrooms are adapted, age appropriate, reflect the heritage culture of students and are multisensory  and bilingual. We continue to provide technology (i.e., Smart Board, laptops, CD players and headphones for audio books).  In  addition, this year pending title III funding, ELL students at Mott Hall High School will have their own labtop cart for use along  with electronic translators.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Native Language support is given in our ESL program through encouraging the use and development of literacy skills in the  native language.  As Spanish is the highly predominant home language of students at Mott Hall High School, these literacy skills  are built and supported through 225 minutes of Spanish language classes given per week at this school.  In addition, the  availability of Spanish and French speaking teachers and other staff members gives many ELLs the option of communicating in  their native language when needed.  For our ELLs of other native language backgrounds, multi-lingual dictionaries, glossaries,  and texts are given as they are available.  In addition, Spanish and French have been offered as language electives in the  school.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     In order to make ELL students feel comfortable within the school a tour of our building is given so that they can feel safe in  their surroundings. Newly enrolled ELL students are invited to visit the school and have an orientation conducted by the ESL  teacher and the Bilingual counselor. In addition, all new incoming students participate in the Summer Bridge program which is  designed to acclimate freshmans to high school and are provided with a personalized appointment with their guidance  councelor  whenever needed.  As it remains the mission and vision of Mott Hall High School to give each student the individual  attention he/she needs in order to thrive in a caring and firm family-like atmosphere, support services for ELL students extend  beyond the classroom.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
