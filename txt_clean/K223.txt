This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the I.S. 223 school community is to provide all students with a safe and nurturing environment and a  high quality education that enables them to be college and career ready in the 21st century.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      At Montauk Junior High School, we honor the diversity of our learners and the uniqueness of young adolescents.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.     Our ENL and SWD population are provided varied levels of scaffolds and supports to allow them access to the   curriculum, to promote language acquisition, and to acquire the skills to effectively communicate to diverse  audiences.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have made significant gains in ELA and Math with an overall 12% proficiency increase across the grades. This is  due to improved instruction and our growing culture of high expectations. Our instructional focus this school year is  questioning and discussion techniques within advanced literacy skills (Rigorous Instruction) with the goal of achieving  higher gains in ELA and Math within our special education and ENL subgroups.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K223   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   950   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

ELA in levels 3s and 4s, and a 15% decrease in level ones across the grades. In 2016, IS 223 was 6% below the district  average in ELA. In 2017, we closed the gap by 50%, now only 3% below the district average. Additionally, our SWD  population demonstrated growth in both content areas with the number of level 1 students decreasing. Students who  took the algebra and living environment regents exams had a 100% passing rate.       2. The Montauk school community recognizes and celebrates our successes, yet understands the importance of  implementing school wide protocols to improve instruction; hence, enabling our students to be academically and  personally successful in today's world. With a deliberate and intentional focus on advanced literacy skills, classroom  teachers will implement hallmark practices in all content areas. This shift in instruction demands more and deeper  interactions with text and talk.   3. For the past two school years, component 3b has been the lowest rated schoolwide with an overall 3.08 and 2.99  respectively. This component is closely aligned with hallmark 2 of advanced literacy instruction. Students need to be  able to communicate in multiple ways with diverse audiences in order to be successful in today's global society.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. IS 223, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      IS223 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing copies of the IS 223 Student Handbook   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   ● hosting six family events in addition to the four mandated parent-teacher nights         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association and Title I Parent  Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● regular translated communication between teacher and the home          School-Parent Compact (SPC)    School-Parent Compact (SPC)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         IS 223, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

One supplemental after-school ENL program will employ three  certified ESL teachers.  The rationale for the program was determined by reviewing the state  exams, the RFSF, the RLAT report and conferencing with teachers and reviewing all data to  drive effective instruction.  Based on data, our beginner and intermediate students need to further  develop their reading and writing skills.  The students participating in this program will receive  small group instruction. To assist these students, teachers will  use a program titled "Discussion  4Learning".  This program will focus on academic vocabulary (social studies and science) which  will improve comprehension in all students regardless of their decoding skills. In addition,  writing activities are also included to connect critical concepts in science and social  studies.  Students will attend 30 two hour sessions beginning in October and ending in May.  They will meet once a week on Wednesdays from 2:20 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. Students participating  in this program are 6th, 7th,  and 8th  grade students.     A second after-school program will employ one certified ESL teacher to provide 6th grade Long  Term ENLs who score Advanced on the 2018 NYSESLAT with small group instruction. This  will be based on our 2018 ELA Item Skills Analysis Report, for the Long Term Advanced ENLs  who may need to further develop their reading skills.   Therefore, the focus of this program will  be reading.  The certified ESL teacher will use a supplemental program titled "Discussion  4Learning". This program will focus on academic vocabulary (social studies and science) which  will improve comprehension in all students regardless of their decoding skills. This after-school  program will meet once a week on Wednesdays from 2:20 p.m. to 4:20 p.m.  Students will attend  22 two hour sessions beginning in November and ending in May.    Title III monies will also fund an after-school program for our newly arrived ENLs. Students  participating in this program will receive intensive English instruction. A supplemental program  titled "English Now" will be used. "English Now" is a standards based language acquisition  program for English Language Learners.  Students will acquire academic and content specific  vocabulary, and have opportunities to write "coherent sentences and rhetorical organized  paragraphs". The ENL program will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20 p.m. - 4:20  p.m.  Students will attend 50 two hour sessions beginning in October and ending in May.   In addition to  receiving English instruction, the newcomers in the after-school program  described above will receive Math instruction by a certified Math teacher.  To further develop  math skills, the certified Math teacher and the ESL teacher will work collaboratively on  Thursdays from 2:20 p.m. to 4:20 p.m.  A math practice website called IXL will be incorporated  in this after-school math class.  IXL consist of unlimited questions in hundreds of math topics.  It  also has a comprehensive reporting system that generates data to be used by the math teacher.  The math after-school program will consist of 30 two hour sessions beginning in November and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   ending in April.  In this program, the ESL teacher will provide support to our ENLs in order to  make the math lessons comprehensible.  For the 2018-19 school year, the Title III after-school programs will employ 5 certified ESL  teachers, and 1 certified Math teacher. These supplemental services will provide ENLs with  additional practice in language development through small group instruction.  Research reflects  that in small group instruction ENL students have a greater opportunity to interact with the  teacher, as well as, an increased opportunity for Accountable Talk.  Students acquire strategies  for learning and problem solving with continued and immediate interaction with their teacher  and classmates.  The ENL/ELA standards are enforced by giving each student the opportunity to  practice listening, speaking, reading and writing.    In addition, Title III monies will fund the Saturday ENL Academy for our newly arrived  ENL's.  Students will attend 20 two hour sessions beginning in October and ending in  April.  All  6th , 7th , and 8th graders are welcome to attend. This program will be divided into  small subgroups: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding. This program  will focus on developing and reinforcing the English language using the four modalities as well  as preparing the students for the NYSESLAT and ELA state tests.  Teachers will implement a  new supplemental program titled "MyOn Reader" which is a digital library program providing  students access to over 8,000 enhanced digital books equipped with multimedia supports, real  time reporting and assessments which indicates the students lexile level, and embedded cloze  reading tools. " Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT" and Beyond programs will be also be  purchased and incorporated.  The focus of our programs will be to prepare the students to build  strong language and literacy skills through speaking, writing, listening and reading.  All lessons  will include rigorous and differentiated tasks that are aligned with the CCLS.  The highly-qualified staff will expand instruction from daily classroom into supplemental  programs. This reinforces the needs of the students.  Through the on-going use of classroom data  (formal/informal assessments, and observation) teachers are better able to differentiate  instruction targeting the specific needs of each English Language Learner.   Effective,  continuous record keeping lies at the heart of our best teaching and learning.  Therefore, after  school records will be maintained and shared with parents by record keeping such as attendance,  student observations, anecdotal records and progress reports.  Parental contact is made in a  variety of ways, to include but is not limited to:  School Messenger (In home language as  designated by the HLIS), back pack notices, conferences with parents, etc.  Translators will be  provided for all parent meetings as our focus for the 2018-2019 school year includes increased  parent involvement specifically with the ELL population.  Teachers working in the supplemental  programs will continue to implement scientifically-based practices for English Language  Learners to promote students acquisition of academic skills and language. Since the teachers  working in the supplemental programs are the same teachers working in the regular school day,  they are aware of the materials ENLs are currently using.  Materials used for these programs will  not duplicate those used during the regular school day.  The materials to be used have already  been previously mentioned.

At I.S. 223, professional  development opportunities are offered to our entire staff to address the diverse needs of our  student population.  There is ongoing deep sustained work occurring with our teachers on most  effective practices in teaching ELLs.  We are focused on teachers applying language objectives  to the classrooms.  Professional development which is both in-house and external is on going and  will take place the remainder of the 2018-2019 school year to support our program.  The topics  that have been selected will assist these teachers in improving instruction and meeting the needs  of all ENLs. Five ESL teachers and one Math teacher will participate in bi-monthly  training.   Each month teachers will participate in two after-school mandated  workshops.  Agendas and sign in attendance will be maintained on our school's PD Tracker  online and is readily accessible to administration.  The initial workshop will discuss the goals of  the supplemental programs, a suggested schedule to be followed, and materials to be  implemented. It is necessary for all teachers working in these supplemental programs to be fully  aware of the objectives previously described. Other topics to be explored are as follows:  October:  Goals and Objectives of Title III after-school programs and Saturday ENL Academy,  Analyzing ELL Data to drive instruction and Servicing English Language Learners.  November:  Five research based methods for teaching ELLs in the Discipline, and Instructional  Approaches Helping ELLs meet new Standards in ELA/ENL/Math.

May:   Assessing Title III Programs to determine its effectiveness, and How to improve future  programs to meet the needs of ENLs.  For the 2018-19 school year, 5 certified teachers participating in the after-school and Saturday  ENL Academy supplemental Title III programs will be provided with sixteen (16) one hour  mandated after-schools sessions.  The 6th teacher will also participate in the after-school  mandated training but will be paid by another funding source. These trainings will not only assist  teachers working in the after-school programs but it will also help teachers who are collaborating  with them during the school day. The assistant principal and the ESL Coordinator will provide  the trainings.

It is for this belief that we provide parents with many opportunities to get involved in  the education of their children. Parents are strongly encouraged to attend ENL classes. Classes  will be instructed by a certified ESL teacher. The instructional focus is on developing parents’  speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. The ESL teacher will provide parents with 40 two  hour sessions.  These sessions will take place on Thursdays and Saturdays.  The Thursday  classes will meet from 2:30 to 4:30, and the Saturday classes will meet from 9:00  to 11:00.  The  ESL  teacher is currently using "Side by Side Plus", and Rosetta Stone will also be implemented.  Some of the topics that will be explored are topics dealing with "life-experiences: Such as  shopping, completing job applications, medical forms, etc.  The ESL teacher will also  incorporate non-fiction reading passages. In addition to learning English, parents are made aware  of the various school activities and important educational issues affecting their children.  In an  effort to create a partnership and inviting parents to attend these after-school English classes,  translated notices are sent home.  All outreach to parents informing them of different school  functions are made through translated email, telephone communication and translated letters.  All  agendas, attendance and invitations are keep filed in a log book.  In addition, IS 223 sends  translated announcements via our automated phone system. The automated phone system is in  place to keep parents abreast of upcoming events. This accommodation assists us in improving  parental involvement.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  IS 223 uses multiple assessments including formative, summative, departmental diagnostic tests, in addition to teacher  observations to assess the literacy skills of all ENL students.  Such assessments include but are not limited to the following:  I- Ready, Edperformance, and Fountas & Pinnell.  This data provides the teacher with a reading level for the ENL students so that  students are reading materials at an appropriate level.  These results help us identify the students’ individual areas of need to  assist in planning differentiated instruction. Curriculum is adapted and sometimes altered to meet the proficiency level and  ENL level of the students.  The New Language Progressions are used accordingly in our classes with ENL  students.  Newsela provides articles on various lexile levels so ENL students can receive content information.  Teachers meet  weekly by department to discuss student needs and monthly as a grade to identify at risk students and share best  practices.  ENL and content area teachers meet weekly to discuss students and plan lessons collaboratively to ensure that all  scaffolds and supports are in place.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55   2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Beginning of the Year, Middle of the Year and End of Year benchmarks are used to track student progress. Department and  grade meetings allow for horizontal and vertical alignment.  AIS services are provided for students identified as high risk.  Small  group instruction provides for targeted differentiation for our ENL students within the classroom setting.  ENL and content  teachers meet weekly to plan lessons based on data and to ensure that all scaffolds and supports are in place.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  On-going evaluation of the success of our ESL programs is monitored throughout the school year through the use of:  •     Determining data trends through the use of state exams, NYSESLAT, Periodic Assessments, I-Ready,                         Ed  Performance, classroom assessments, conferencing and portfolio review   •               I-Ready is administered three times throughout the year to identify areas of need and progress monitoring is utilized  by the teachers to track student progress  •     Observations of students by teachers and administrators  •     School Report Card  •     Students making AYP   •     Student attendance and participation in after-school and Saturday programs        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative data drives our PD plan and AIS program.  Interventions are discussed and shared in Department and Grade  meetings as well as in our Inquiry teams.  If the data deems a child at risk, that student is not only targeted within their  classroom but is pulled out in a small group for Academic Intervention Services.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   I.S. 223 uses data from the NYSELAT, ELA and Math state exams, I-Ready, and classroom exams/observations to identify at-risk  students. The Fountas and Pinnell assessment is then used for obtaining the students instructional and independent reading  levels and specific strengths and weaknesses of each student. Additionally, analysis of the running record provides us with  insight into the type of reading errors being made by each students.  Furthermore, analysis of the comprehension questions  allows us to see specifically where a student is having difficulty.  These students are grouped accordingly and scheduled for  academic intervention and reading intervention services from 1-3 times a week.  AIS instruction includes extensive vocabulary  development, fluency practice, and comprehension skills within a guided reading model.   Additionally, these students are  targeted within their classes by the ENL, general education, and special education teacher if applicable.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data from the NYS ELA & Math assessments show that we have made marginal gains among our ENL population. The  NYSELAT data has demonstrated that more of our ENL students moved at least one proficiency level; however, more also did  not show any gains in ENL level.  Additionally, I-Ready data is used as a baseline, mid year, and end of year assessment with  growth monitoring.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ELA, Math, and NYSELAT data has been analyzed and disseminated by administrators and our data team.  ELA, Math, ESL, and  special education teachers in conjunction with our science and social studies teachers analyzed the data for their current  students.  Additionally, teachers were given the opportunity to analyze the test data of their former students in order to reflect  upon their instructional practices.  Our data specialist systematically analyzes trends,  and disseminates findings with the  Instructional team.  In the Instructional team meetings curriculum and programmatic adjustments are discussed.  The team  then communicates this information within their department. Professional learning is planned accordingly.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL students are grouped according to ENL status and travel together as a class; therefore, all students receive a  the minimum mandated time allocations for ESL instruction.  Classes are formed based on grade and the ENL levels of  the students.  In heterogeneous classes where there are varying levels, students are over-serviced.  Classes travel  together throughout the school day.  In our classes for newcomers, two grades may be combined based on  proficiency level.  Our ENL and content area teachers work collaboratively to design and deliver instruction which  includes appropriate scaffolds and supports to make the content accessible to all students.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Classes are formed based on proficiency levels and ESL instructional minutes are programmed accordingly.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Classes are formed based on proficiency levels and ESL instructional minutes are programmed accordingly. Content teachers  and ESL teachers have designated planning time to ensure effective collaboration.  Scaffolds and supports are provided in each  lesson to make the content accessible to all students.  The use of the New Language Progressions in addition to explicit and  targeted vocabulary instruction foster content and language development.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?           All teachers are instructed to encourage ELLs to use their native language as a spring board for acquiring new English  language skills and content knowledge.  As stated above, native language content materials are distributed to ELLs when  possible.  ELLs are given a glossary to use the entire school day. They are also assigned a “buddy” to help them understand the  lesson.  The assigned “buddy” also translates for the limited English speaker his/her responses to classroom tasks and  homework assignments for the teacher to assess and evaluate. Students are encouraged to speak frequently through think  pair shares, small group discussions, etc.               In addition, teachers make every effort to translate classroom tasks and exams in the student’s native  language.  Classroom teachers use an online translator and the teacher displays the various translations on the Smart Board.  They also refer to the NYS Education Department’s assessment website to obtain content area questions from translated  content area exams. Our staff members are called upon to translate the responses or the student’s “buddy” translates, if a  staff member is not available.                 For state exams, our students are offered the exams in their native language.  If the exam does not exist in the  student’s native language, we make every effort to provide an oral translator.  We found, based on data, students who receive  a translated version of a state exam or whose exam is orally translated generally do better than ELLs who take the exam in  English.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE - These students receive the opportunity to attend Title III Saturday program.  Those students not able to attend the  Saturday program participate in the after-school program. In these supplemental programs, teachers focus on students’  individual needs in order for them to achieve higher academic standards. Students participating in these programs enhance  their abilities in identifying and using reading and listening strategies to make text comprehensible and meaningful.          Newcomers - participate in after-school and Saturday programs.  These programs are geared to maximize English language  learning and acquisition.  These students are encouraged to continue developing their native language skills which in turn will  help them in their second language learning.  Native language materials are provided to them, if they are available in the  student’s native language.  Classroom libraries and our school library have native language materials that will support our ELLs.  If native language materials are not available, materials that are age and grade appropriate that match their literacy level are  provided to them.               Newly arrived students are placed in our "Newcomers" class and are encouraged to use their native language in their  classrooms.  Students are given the opportunity to sit and work with students speaking the same language.  They are also  encouraged to write their responses in their native language and to use a bilingual dictionary.  I.S. 223 is aware that the  “development of native language skills plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of English language arts.” (The Teaching of  Language Arts to Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for All Teachers).  Additionally,  teachers use visuals and a variety of instructional strategies to foster language acquisition and content knowledge.                ENL students taking the NYS ELA exam for the first time this school year get extra support from our ESL and ELA  teachers.  Through small group instruction, teachers address the needs of the students.  The teachers focus on developing  students’ reading and writing skills and test taking strategies.  Students are also familiarized with test format.  This additional  support will prepare our students for the standardized ELA exam and will strengthen students’ English proficiencies.        Long-term ELLs - These students are encouraged to attend after school programs with certified ELA and reading teachers in  order to receive the support they need.  Based on teacher assessments, these students need help with their reading and  writing.  Furthermore,  these students are encouraged to attend after-school and Saturday programs.               Our former ELLs are placed in classes with our advanced ELLs.  ESL teachers not only service our advanced ELLs but also  our former ELLs when they push-in to content area classes. Our former ELLs attend after-school and/or Saturday programs.  ELLs who scored proficient on the NYSESLAT exam will receive the same testing modifications as our current ELLs.  Former ELLs  are also monitored by classroom teachers and our guidance counselors three times a year to determine any difficulties  confronted by the students.               All ENL students gain access to the content through varying levels of scaffolds and supports provided by the ESL teachers  in collaboration with the content teachers.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?             Our students with special needs receive services according to their IEP.  Our ESL teachers push-in self-contained content  area classes to provide them with ENL services as required under CR Part 154. Our ESL teachers push into classrooms in order  to minimize disruption to classroom learning environment.  This push-in model provides optimal opportunities to learn content  while in their classroom. ELL-SWDs in self-contained, ICT and general education classes study the same grade level curriculum  as their peers but with specific modifications, scaffolds, and supports. To make content comprehensible to them ESL teachers  tap into the students’ prior knowledge, build background knowledge, utilize the New Language Progressions, use scaffolding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      techniques, differentiate, and incorporate graphic organizers and visuals.        Additional instructional strategies are implemented via Universal Design For Learning (UDL).  UDL helps students  comprehend information that is presented to them.   UDL enables ELL-SWDs to have information presented to them in  multiple ways, provides them the opportunity to express their knowledge in their own unique ways, and engages the students  in learning through different modalities.  Instruction is customized and adjusted to meet the needs of each ELL-SWD student.              A safe, nurturing learning environment is vital for language acquisition.  Teachers differentiate instruction, tasks, and  rubrics, and offer students books on their reading level as per IEP requirements.  Teachers buddy ELLs with students who share  the same language.  This allows time for Accountable Talk and debate.  This affords ELLs the time and opportunity needed to  acquire new vocabulary.  Shared reading and writing practices fosters fluency, reading comprehension, and proper mechanics  and usage. Furthermore, the utilization of the writing process provides  ELL-SWDs with the opportunity to work with a buddy  to create and correct writing that fill their work folders and portfolios with pieces from different genres and builds academic  vocabulary.        Our special needs students are provided services as indicated by their IEP.  ENL and Special Education teachers review each  IEP to ensure that that all IEP mandates are met.  Teachers create and discuss current IEP goals, and devise an instructional  plan that includes strategies that will assist the ELL-SWD to acquire language and content.   In an effort to continue to offer  programs to facilitate and foster learning to this specific, targeted population, our school provides Newsela, BrainPOP,  BrainPOP Jr, BrainPOP ESL, Moby Max, Goalbook, and IXL. Our ELL-SWDs are encouraged to attend our after-school and  Saturday classes.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Flexible scheduling allows IS 223 to provide a series of interventions for at-risk students. Teacher inquiry teams meet to discuss  targeted interventions for at-risk ELLs.  Curricular and instructional flexibility allows teachers of ENL-SWDs to differentiate  instruction and adapt curriculum in order to meet the goals of a student’s IEP within the least restrictive  environment.   Additionally, our self-contained ENL students receive additional small group reading instruction with an ENL  and special education teacher.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.            I.S. 223 makes every effort to accommodate the needs of all English Language Learner sub-groups.  After carefully  studying data, we focus on individual needs in order for them to achieve higher academic standards. Besides implementing  after-school, and Saturday intervention classes, our teachers differentiate instruction, provide one to one and/or small group  instruction, peer tutoring, encourage ELLs to continue to develop their native language skills, provide them with native  language materials, and provide materials that match the student’s literacy level.             IXL is incorporated in our after-school Math classes, as well as, in Math classes meeting on Saturdays.  IXL is a math  practice website consisting of unlimited questions in hundreds of math topics.  It has a comprehensive reporting system that  generates real-time data to be used by the intervention teacher and the student’s regular Math teacher.            The guidance counselor continues to work with individual students and their families.  She closely monitors ELLs and  provides them and their families with strategies to develop English proficiency by having frequent meetings with teachers to  monitor progress.  This interaction creates an additional level of support that builds on classroom instruction, thereby  increasing student proficiency and academic achievement.  Students who are not progressing are strongly encouraged to  participate in supplemental activities, such as after-school and Saturday programs, or any other academic intervention services  we provide.          Students who are at risk are also discussed at monthly Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) meetings. Teachers are encouraged to  submit to the guidance counselor the names of these students and the interventions they have implemented.  The results are  then discussed at length.  Home contacts regarding the students are also discussed at the PPT.  The PPT makes suggestions for  future interventions which may include at risk counseling, SETSS, in class strategies, etc. If the interventions that the teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      has implemented are not successful, further testing by the School Assessment Team may be administered in order to provide a  greater understanding of the students’ difficulties.  Recommendations may include a more restrictive environment.           A guidance counselor continues to provide support to ELLs who scored proficient on the 2016 and 2017 NYSESLAT.  At I.S.  223, the guidance counselor meets with the former ELL at least three times a year to determine any social and/or academic  difficulties the student may have.  Strategies to overcome any obstacles are shared with the student and his/her family.  Former ELLs are encouraged to participate in any after-school and/or Saturday programs designed for ELLs.  In addition, these  students receive the same accommodations on state exams as ELLs.           At the beginning of the school year the staff receives a list of students who currently scored out of ESL.  They are made  aware that these students are monitored very closely by the guidance counselor.  The teachers are encouraged to meet with  the guidance counselor and the assistant principal overseeing the ESL program if any of the former ELLs are faced with any  difficulties.  The staff is well aware that former ELLs are entitled to the same testing accommodations as ELLs.          Staff members will continue to use formal and informal assessments in order to meet the needs of all students, especially  ENL students. ESL teachers provide extra help in English while pushing-in content area classes.  Morning, after-school and  Saturday programs provide additional support to all ELLs regardless of their English proficiency level.           During our Inquiry Team meetings teachers discuss ways they can help at risk students including ELLs meet academic  standards.  To determine the student’s strengths and weaknesses the team studies his/her data and analyzes the student’s  work. The team then develops a plan using GoalBook which incorporates strategies to build on the student’s strengths and  selects strategies that addresses the student’s weaknesses.  The strategies are shared with all of the student’s teachers so that  the ELL student can make gains and develop academic language.          To prepare students for the NYS ELA, Mathematics, Science, and NYSESLAT exams, I.S. 223 provides extensive sessions  focusing on test taking strategies and familiarizing students with test format. These preparatory classes taking place  during after-school and Saturday programs minimize students’ test taking anxiety.  I.S. 223 continues to make every effort to  provide testing modifications to maximize the students’ advantage. For the spring 2016 and 2017 state exams, oral translations  were provided to speakers of the following languages:  Arabic, and Bengali.  Speakers of Spanish, Chinese, and Russian  received copies of the translated version of the NYS exams.  Oral translations and translated versions of exams provide  students with the opportunity to successfully demonstrate the content knowledge they have mastered.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year we are continuing PBIS- Positive Behavior Intervention & Supports.  PBIS is a systems approach that emphasizes the  prevention of problem behaviors through proactive instruction of desired behaviors, regular reinforcement of appropriate  behavior, and monitoring and correction of problem behavior. Schools using this approach have dramatically reduced  discipline problems, improved attendance and test scores, and have an overall better school climate. The purpose of school- wide PBIS is to establish a climate in which appropriate behavior is the norm.     Our PBIS matrix is Montauk PRIDE – Prepared, Respectful, Involved, Disciplined, & Empathetic. With this matrix, we have  established expectations that we teach our students for use in all areas of the school building – including the classrooms,  cafeteria, hallways, and the auditorium. When students meet these expectations, they are rewarded with tickets they use to  redeem for prizes in the school store. Staff is also acknowledged for support of this program with certificates of recognition,  and gift certificates.      Though the program is still in its beginning stages, we are already seeing improvements in the school, and a reduction of  behavioral incidents. Students are excited to be in school and earn tickets, and teachers are seeing positive results in the  classroom.        Data from the state tests have shown that our ENL population has shown marginal growth.  We will continue to build upon this  by enhancing daily instruction.  Teachers will receive professional development to add to their instructional toolbox, in order  to meet the needs of all students, including our ENL students.  Collaboration between the ESL and content teachers will  continue to be improved by providing more time for planning together.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      All ELLs are included in our after-school, and Saturday supplemental programs.  The after-school program provides ELLs with  small group instruction in ELA, Math, and ESL from October to May. Students participating in the 9:00 to 12:00 Saturday  program receive small group instruction in ESL, ELA and Math from October to May.  They also receive one hour of physical  fitness.  Besides participating in academic programs especially designed for ELLs, they participate in the after-school and  Saturday recreational programs. ELLs attend Chorus, Chess, Dance, Robotics, Band, Spirit Club, Young Runners  C.H.A.M.P.S.,  and Computer  classes.      All ELLs are strongly encouraged by teachers and the administration to attend all curricular and extracurricular  activities.  Teachers distribute permission slips for each activity to students.  Students may also get a permission slip from a  bulletin board displaying the after-school and Saturday programs offered at I.S.223.  Announcements of the various programs  and activities are made over the loud speaker and in the cafeteria.  Applications describing the program, as well as dates and  times are distributed to ELLs in their native language.  Parents receive automated voice messages in their native language,  informing them of the wonderful curricular and extracurricular activities offered at I.S. 223.      In addition, ELLs are invited to attend social activities, such as school dances, pumpkin carving, movie night, cupcake  decorating, and family painting.  Based on data from sign-in sheets and attendance rosters, a large number of ELL students  participate in curricular and extracurricular activities.  At I.S. 223 all our ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support the learning of ELLs we use a variety of materials which include, but are not limited to the following: Sadlier  Vocabulary for Success, Visions, Milestones, Voices In Literature, Making Connections, IXL, Rosetta Stone, Newsela, I-Ready,  BrainPOP ESL, Moby Max, picture books, multi-level novels, graphic novels, and Core curriculum materials differentiated for  ELLs.     Technology is an effective tool in helping all students and especially ENL students succeed in all subject areas.  At I.S. 223,  technology continues to be integrated in all content areas.  The entire building is wired for Internet access.  All classrooms,  therefore, have access to computer integration to support immersion learning in the content area. This will facilitate ENL  students continued participation in project-based activities which improve their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills  while learning basic, yet invaluable, skills in the use of technology. Students continue to be able to access software to enhance  the use of graphic organizers, templates, process writing, research, and project work.  This provides differentiation of a  finished project including multi-media presentation. laptops and IPads are available to all ELLs to use in school.                  In addition, all classrooms are equipped with a Smart Board. The Smart Board encourages the involvement of all  learners in every subject area.  Students become active learners, making them responsible for their own learning.  Research  has found that the Smart Board is an effective learning tool that accommodates the different learning styles of all students.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At I.S. 223 ELLs continue to develop their native language skills.  Translations are provided whenever possible.  Content area  glossaries in the native language are distributed to all ELLs to help them learn vocabulary and understand new concepts.  Classroom libraries and our school library have native language materials that will assist our ELLs in developing their native  language skills.             IS 223 is fortunate to have staff members who speak Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, and  Arabic.   These staff members use these  native languages when needed in order to assist our ENL students. Students are also  given the opportunity to sit and work with students speaking the same language and are encouraged to write and speak their  responses in their native language.              Parents are encouraged to continue using their native language in the home to enhance their children’s native language  skills. Strategies that promote language learning are shared with the parents.  Parents are made aware that literacy in the  native language will help their children in developing proficiency in the second language.              I.S. 223 has made every effort to promote literacy in the native language because research has shown that the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      “development of native language skills plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of English language arts.” (The Teaching of  Language Arts to Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for All Teachers).       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     All our ELLs except for students in the “Welcome” class are placed in grade level classes and are taught grade level  content.  Our “Welcome” students are interclassed into what we call a “Step-up Welcome Class” as soon as they acquire  enough English to be successful in their new grade level class. Our ELLs study the same curricula in all content areas as their  non-ELL peers.  Content area teachers modify the curriculum to make all content comprehensible to ENL students.  The  materials that we are currently using are age appropriate in order to keep all ENLs engaged in learning.          In the continuing effort to develop literacy skills and academic knowledge,  age and grade appropriate materials are  provided to all ENLs.  The ELLs use the same core curriculum materials as the mainstream students.  For Mathematics, CMP3 is  used; for Science, New York Science 6, 7, 8; and for Social Studies, the 6th grade uses History of Our World, the 7th grade uses  United States History/NY History Beginning 1877, and the 8th grade uses American History. Teachers incorporate scaffolding  strategies to make content accessible to all students. Materials are translated when possible. Supplemental content area  materials, and content area glossaries are provided to our ENL population. This allows students to gain a deeper understanding  of content information, which leads to English proficiency.  This is based on the understanding that proficiency in a second  language can best be developed when it is allowed to emerge naturally through the use of functional language for authentic  purposes.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our library, auditorium, and cafeteria are shared spaces with another school housed in our building.  Scheduling is done to  accomodate both schools.  No resources are shared.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ENL students and parents are invited to visit our school prior to opening day. They have the opportunity to  acquaint themselves with the school building by visiting classrooms, the library, the auditorium, the cafeteria, and the school  yard.  ELLs meet the administration and other staff members.  The assistant principals supply the newly enrolled student with a  copy of his/her program card and the class program card is reviewed with the student.  The school makes every effort to  arrange for a student presently attending I.S. 223 to visit with the newcomer, preferably another English Language Learner  who speaks his/her language to describe a typical day and provide additional information about our school.            At this meeting, ELLs learn about the various programs available to them.  These programs take place in the morning,  during school, after-school, and on Saturdays.  Students will also be shown a presentation of various activities that took place  in the previous school year: for example,  students participating in special classroom projects, Art Exhibits,  Music Concerts,  Graduation, Filmmaking projects,  Multicultural Fairs, and ELLs participating in many of our residencies.           All ELLs are informed that they have access to laptop computers and IPads. This will facilitate continued participation in  project-based activities to help improve their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills while learning basic, yet invaluable,  skills in the use of technology.  These laptops have been provided by a Title II D grant.   In addition, every classroom has a  Smart Board and is wired for Internet access.  All classrooms, therefore, have access to computer integration to support  immersion learning in the content area.     For those ENL students who enroll throughout the school year a staff member will provide information about our school,  acquaint them with the building by providing a tour and then escort the student to his/her new class where the teacher will  assign the new student a “buddy”. On the tour the staff member will point out the bulletin board that displays applications for  all academic and extra-curricular activities, and a calendar displayed in the hallway announcing all school activities, such as  Twin Day, Pajama Day, etc.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    NA to Junior High School.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?         NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?            At I.S. 223 extensive professional development is planned to improve instruction for our ENL students.  Professional learning  opportunities are available within the school, on the district level, and through outside agencies.  All teachers are teachers of  ELLs so it is our mission to keep staff members abreast of the latest instructional strategies and research in order to better  serve our ELL population.   We have provided extensive professional development on collaborative team teaching and planning.  Additionally, the  instructional coach/assistant principal schedules inter-visitations for teachers to see best practices.  Collaborative lesson  studies are done throughout the school year in which content area, special educators, and ESL teachers design and execute a  lesson while building their instructional toolboxes.  Teachers continuously revisit, adjust, and modify curriculum maps and unit  tasks to ensure that all learners have access to the curriculum.   Professional development will take place during designated PD time and during Lunch and Learns.  Based on analysis of  teacher data according to the Danielson Framework and teacher input, our professional development calendar includes the  following:  Goalbook , Scaffolds for ELLs in All Content Areas, WICOR strategies, Collaborative Team Teaching, Google  Classroom, New Language Progressions, Fountas & Pinnell Leveling, Interactive Vocabulary Strategies, Think Alouds, and  Shared Reading and Writing Practices.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional development within our building is designed to meet the instructional needs of our teachers.  Furthermore,  specific professional development is provided for our ENL teachers but all our teachers are welcome or mandated to attend  because all teachers are teachers on ELLs.  Teachers also seek outside Professional Learning opportunities.  IS 223 has a  Professional Development tracker where teachers log what professional development they have attended.  Additionally,  agendas and attendance for in house PLOs are kept on file.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to parent teacher conferences, parents are contacted or invited up for face to face meetings on Tuesdays during  parental contact time and during other times of the day.  In these meetings teachers discuss language and content goals.  Our  teachers use the translation hotline and staff members to act as translators in these meetings.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Research has shown that there is a correlation between parental involvement and student success.  It is for this belief that we  provide parents with many opportunities to get involved in the education of their children.  Some activities that we encourage  our parents to participate in are: Curriculum Night, Parent-Teacher Conferences, monthly Parent Association Meetings, Movie  Night, and workshops provided by the staff.       To encourage parents to attend Parent Association meetings we always include a light dinner and a family activity.  Some  examples of these activities are:  Family Pumpkin Carving, Cupcake Decorating, Art and Music Festival, Family Science Day, and  Family Paint Night.  Our parent association meetings not only inform parents of important information, but also  provide parents the opportunity to spend quality time together.  Additionally, these meetings also give parents the  opportunity to meet other parents.              In an effort to keep parents informed about the various school activities and important educational issues affecting their  children, and at the same time create a partnership, translated notices are sent home with the students.  In addition, I.S. 223  sends translated announcements via our automated phone system.  The automated phone system is in place to keep parents  abreast of upcoming events.  At this time they are also made aware that translators are available to translate for them at these  events. This accommodation assists us in making parents aware of important issues, and most importantly, improve parent  involvement. This accommodation encourages parents, especially the parents of ELLs, to participate.   In order for parents to communicate with staff members, translators are provided for parent-teacher conferences and all  parent meetings. At parent meetings a portable and wireless system called “Talk and Listen System” allows parents to hear  information in their own language through an interpreter. The “Talk and Listen System” allows all parents needing translation  to hear meetings and participate in workshops in their native language in a non-threatening manner, and most importantly  without segregation.  By providing this service more parents will be involved in the education of their children.  In addition,  providing translators at all school activities will also help parents build connections with the school and other parents.  Our  hope by creating a welcoming environment is to strengthen the parent-school relationship.      For the past three years we were fortunate to have the Counseling in Schools grant which sponsored many of our after- school, Saturday activities, and parent workshops.   Currently we do afford parents of ELLs the opportunity to attend city-wide  conferences provided by the Office of English Language Learners, and also workshops provided by the Community Education  Council of District 20 which take place on a monthly basis. We also contact the Asian Outreach Agency of Maimonides Hospital  in Brooklyn when families are in need of health benefits.  Additionally, we offer weekly English classes to our parents and  various other workshops.            Our bilingual parent coordinator has worked diligently with other staff members to increase parental involvement.  The  School Leadership Team (SLT) discusses ways to increase parental involvement.  The parents on the Leadership Team have also  expressed the needs of the parents to the principal.  Some of their concerns are how to contact teachers, homework, how to  get metro cards, morning and afternoon dismissal, etc.  I.S. 223 makes every effort to address the needs of our parents.  Data  has demonstrated that our efforts have been effective. Parental involvement, especially those of our ENL students has  increased immensely.              Our bilingual parent coordinator has established a wonderful rapport with our parents, especially with the parents of  ELLs.  ELL parents have expressed to him their needs and concerns via e-mail, phone calls, and face to face.  He has assisted  them in the following ways:  •     Assisting them with completion of forms.  •     Ensuring that all students are covered by health insurance, as specified by the Chancellor’s Children’s First Initiative.  •     Communicating with diversified local agency offices.  •     Cooperating with the administration and staff in matters relating to the student’s  welfare.     •     Familiarizing parents with I.S. 223’s and/or district 20’s initiatives.             The needs of our parents drive our parent involvement activities.  Incoming 6th grade parents have expressed their  concerns of sending their children to a middle school for the first time.  As a result, we have an orientation for all students  including our ELLs.   This allows students to acquaint themselves with the school and parents to  have the opportunity to learn  about the various available academic activities to help their children succeed.  Some of these activities are the Compass after  school program, Montauk's after-school opportunities, and Saturday Academy.  The 6th Grade Orientation reassures parents  that their children are in a safe environment with many opportunities for them to excel.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                      ELL parents have also expressed their need to learn English.  English classes are therefore offered to them and their adult  family members on Friday afternoons.  We are currently using Rosetta Stone and a program titled Side by Side Plus.  These  programs are assisting parents in developing speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.  We are pleased that many of our  ELL families are taking advantage of this opportunity.  IS 223 firmly believes that programs that benefit parents will inevitably  benefit their children.         Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrew Frank, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Montauk                                                                              School DBN: 20K223  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To assess our schools written translation and oral interpretation needs, we analyze the following: the Home  Language Report, and students' home language forms. In addition, we determine parents' needs through requests  of parents needing a translator at meetings, Parent-Teacher conferences, registration, etc. Our parent coordinator  also surveys our parents to determine the language parents prefer for all written and oral communication.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68     2.
