This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design (WHSAD for short) is a 9-12 college preparatory school  committed to developing students as imaginative critical thinkers. Our mission is to provide students with valuable,  marketable and unique skill sets that bolster their employability in multiple industries (such as conservation,  engineering, and city planning) and that bolster their admission to institutions of higher learning. The environment at   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      WHSAD promotes academic achievement through the integration of a student’s career interests and aptitude while  establishing connections between classroom learning and the world in which we live.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design is a 9-12 college preparatory school committed to  developing students as imaginative critical thinkers. Our curricula builds a foundation of visual knowledge, skills and  literacy for creative problem solving, as students are exposed to design and architecture in stand-alone courses as  well as having these studies infused into their core academic courses. The environment at Williamsburg High School  for Architecture and Design promotes academic achievement through the integration of a student’s career interests  and aptitude while establishing connections between classroom learning and the world in which we live.    The Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design (WHSAD for short) offers students a unique and engaging  four-year course sequence with a focus in architectural drafting, design principles, and historic preservation. Our  inter-disciplinary and hands-on approach to architecture, design, and the visual arts integrates internship experiences  and skills training throughout core academic content areas. WHSAD students can earn a Career & Technical Education  (CTE) endorsed diploma in Architectural Drafting & Design, and up to 6 college credits upon graduation from our  program. In addition, as a newly appointed SYEP school, we now offer as much as 250 paid summer interships per  year, which means that more than 1 in three WHSAD students will be offered work.    All of our students are given the opportunity to participate in paid internships with industry partners.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In addition to addressing a wide spectrum of learning needs, our student body is made of 77% male students, most of  whom are African American and Hispanic. We have consistently graduated over 95% of our students, many of whom  leave WHSAD with Advanced Regents diplomas and most of whom leave with Regents diplomas. Furthermore, over  95% of our students graduate with a Career and Technical Education (CTE) endorsement and an industry certification  in the architectural drafting software Auto-CAD, which enables them to join the workforce at an entry level and begin  their careers while attending college. This has given our students an advantage upon graduating college: Our students  would have earned work experience upon graduating college while many of their peers at other schools would have  yet to work their first jobs. Because we strive for students with IEPs to make the same, or better, gains as the general  education population, our students require a number of specific resources to achieve these goals. These resources  include, a full time social worker, after school enrichment run by the special education teachers, school day follow-up  and interventions such as study hall and a host of computer based-aids. Because nearly one third of our students have  IEPs, a substantial portion of the budget is allotted to these resources.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   WHSAD’s key focus for the coming year, as detailed in the CEP goals below, is to teach and cultivate our students’  ability to make evidence-based claims in writing and to perform reflective self-assessment of their classwork with the  aim of defending their claims in writing, both of which are prerequisites to succeeding in the workforce and in college.      Of the elements described in the Framework for Great Schools, WHSAD has made the most progress over the 2017- 2018 school year in Rigorous Instruction. Specifically, WHSAD addressed Rigorous Instruction by requiring that all  students (no matter learning style/level) in all classes (regardless of subject) make evidence-based claims (as per  Common Core) in writing every day. As a school community, we determined that, on whole, the greatest weakness  exhibited by our students was their inability to provide supporting evidence for factual claims – particularly in writing.  According to our students’ performance on formative assessments throughout the year, we have seen a good deal of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         progress in this area. We intend to continue this initiative for the 2018-2019 school year with an intense focus on  student autonomy.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 14K558   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   566   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.           1. Over 90% of WHSAD students enter the school at a Level 1 or 2 in mathematics as Freshmen in any given   year. We have prioritized moving Freshmen students who score below a Level 3 in mathematics to a  minimum of level 3, as per New York State standardized testing, by the end of their Freshmen year at WHSAD.     2. Data trends have shown that female graduates enter college at a 17% higher rate than male students   (based on a four year aggregate taken between 2012 and 2017. Our goal is to level this off by June, 2019. We  will begin doing this by ensuring that our students enter the twelfth grade on track for gradation so that we  can focus solely on gradation and not intervention. This begins with the Regents exams.     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   As all of the following are writing-based exams, and because our focus is to improve the quantity and quality of  graduation rates (with regards to the number of students entering college upon graduation), our goal is for a minimum  of 75% of the sophomore cohort to pass the Global Regents in June 2018, and a minimum of 75% of the sophomore  cohort to pass the English Regents in June 2019.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Each Monday, teachers will attend a subject PL headed up by a  lead teacher. They will review updated data, determine  interventions needed and set instruction targets for their  students. This will be based on writing across the curriculum  standards.    Grade-level instructional support teachers will provide  personalized instruction to high-needs students so to maintain a  tenable degree of rigor in their math assignments.   In partnership with the PTA leadership, parent engagement  nights will be designed to create ongoing afterschool learning  activities that target specific algebraic concepts used in  architecture. The goal is to stoke a level of interest in home study  in the subject of Algebra, hopefully encouraged by the projects  parents and students take home from these workshops.    Periodic data analysis conducted every Tuesday utilizing the  most recent formative assessment data, cycles of observation  ensuring all teachers will be observed formally on a regular basis,  weekly department meetings every Monday to reinforce the  instructional agenda, and others systems the school deems  necessary to ensure the non-negotiables are implemented.          3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  A minimum of 75% of the Freshmen cohort who were admitted to the school as Level 1 and 2 in mathematics will  participate in a mock (practice) Integrated Algebra exam in January 2019. The expectation is that there will be a 90%  pass rate amongst this sample. Based upon a needs assessment generated by the results of this test and the item  analysis to follow, students will be given individualized interventions. These interventions will be gauged via a second  mock exam implanted in marking period 2 of the second semester.       Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  Teachers will administer summative assessments in all math classes at the end of each marking period, in order to  remark student progress in both content and (more importantly) student ability to incorporate this content into  problem solving. Teachers will use these assessments to inform instruction and academic interventions for the next  marking period, as well as inform their conferences with students.     Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans     Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and  school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  No less than 12 students (nearly 10% of the cohort) were transferred to WHSAD’s class of 2018 (as both 11th and 12th  graders) who, due to being underserved in previous schools, require many credits in order to graduate on time.  Guidance supports are necessary to ensure WHSAD's graduation and attendance rate in 2019 remain consistent.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  It is our goal to increase or maintain student graduation rate at 98% for June 2019. This will be reinforced by much  needed coaching that will be implemented bi-weekly coaching sessions by CBO Creative Connections for all students,  in both a whole group push-in and small group pull-out fashion.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under- credited, SIFE, STH).      Guidance counselors will conduct meetings with teachers in  order to review and support students’ socio/emotional needs,  particularly those of most concern. In addition, students will  be monitored by the school social worker and will address  interventions, where needed. The social worker will advise  early interventions for 12th graders in the Fall term, to help  ensure students graduate on time.   As an offshoot of the Fall intervention plan, guidance  counselors will work with lead teachers to craft afterschool  interventions for 12th grade students at risk of not graduating.  These interventions are designed to help these students  complete required class work and to help them achieve high  grades. The success of these opportunities will be measured at  the start of the Spring term after a review of their transcript  grades, standardized test grades, and progress toward  graduation.   Based on results from February 2018 senior student data,  guidance counselors will identify seniors who are not on track  for graduation and will appoint staff “mentors” to these  seniors. The staff mentors will be responsible for deploying  differentiated strategies designed by guidance counselors, to  ensure students receive one-on-one attention on their path to  graduation. This will take place as a Circular 6 activity and  afterschool assignment.           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   All at-risk  students,  students with  documented  socio/emotional  needs   All at-risk  students,  students with  documented  socio/emotional  needs   9/2018 –  6/2019   guidance  counselors, social  worker, Assistant  Principal of Pupil  Personnel Services   1/2019 –  2/2019   guidance  counselors, social  worker, Assistant  Principal of Pupil  Personnel Services   2/2019 -  6/2019   All at-risk  students,  students with  documented  socio/emotional  needs   guidance  counselors, social  worker, Assistant  Principal of Pupil  Personnel Services   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to  support  the  whole  child?

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. The leadership comprises of pedagogues who have taught (and had State teaching license) in ELA, Math, Science  and Social Studies classrooms. For this reason, the whole leadership cabinet can act as coaches rather than just as  “administrators”.      2. An internal survey data collected from the school team of lead teachers, both indicate that while WHSAD students  generally outperform students in peer schools, non-CTE academic classes at WHSAD lack the element of autonomous  learning. In particular, special needs students (i.e. ENL and ICT) who are demonstrably unskilled in these areas,  emphasize the need for supports and structures that encourage learner-centered lesson designs.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June, 2019, no less than 90% of lessons taught at WHSAD, at any given moment, will be driven by learner centered  lesson designs. An in-house peer review survey will determine a baseline in Fall 2018, with the expectation of growth as  reflected by a similar survey to be taken in June 2019.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.      In partnership with the teaching/education department of St. Francis College, WHSAD hosts a number of  student teachers with the interest of attracting potential candidates for vacancies in core academic areas  (math, science, English language arts, social studies). WHSAD’s relationship with the student teacher serves as  an interview process by which the school can establish rapport with the student teacher and evaluate their  compatibility with the school (which ultimately fosters teacher retention), as well as their capability in the  classroom. Student teachers who perform well at WHSAD, but cannot be hired for full-time positions may at  least be recommended to serve as qualified substitute teachers.     WHSAD also hosts interns from the Success via Apprenticeship (SVA) program, wherein one of our seasoned   Career and Technical Education (CTE) teachers mentors an SVA intern. The goal of the SVA program is for  interns to acquire specialty certification in a CTE field of study. Subsequent to graduation from SVA, the intern  (who by this point would have had a working relationship with our school and would have become familiar  with our architecture drafting program) may then be hired by our school should a vacancy materialize. In  addition to hosting interns from the SVA program, our school has recommended our own students to SVA  with the hopes that they return as dedicated and qualified architecture drafting teachers.     WHSAD prioritizes interviews for teaching positions to candidates who have a graduate degree in the subject  area of the position to which they have applied. This ensures they are highly qualified in the sense that they  are knowledgeable and conversant in their content area.     WHSAD practices distributed leadership amongst teaching staff as a measure to promote teacher retention   and to promote the educational mission of the school. The administration makes it a point that teachers  model best practices to their own colleagues during professional development sessions. This way, teachers  understand their work and input is valued, while simultaneously promoting community amongst staff           2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).       In accordance with the UFT contract enacted for the 2015-2016 school year, the extended day sessions on  Mondays are dedicated to reinforcing best teaching and assessment practices that align with the school’s  tenets that: 1) All lessons must be guided by a clear aim that requires students to defend a position. 2) All   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      lessons must include an activity that requires students to prepare and share evidence-based claims. 3) All  lessons must require students to write and present an argument using evidence-based claims in order to  reach the lesson’s aim.  In accordance with the UFT contract enacted for the 2015-2016 school year, the extended day sessions on  Tuesdays are dedicated to professional development addressing the socio-emotional and differentiated  instructional needs of specific students. Teachers are typically grouped by cohort and are encouraged to share  their interactions with struggling students and to mutually develop strategies to differentiate instruction for  these particular students.  In addition to the Monday and Tuesday extended day professional development sessions, teachers are  required to participate in weekly academic department meetings, headed by an Assistant Principal, wherein  teachers develop lesson plans and curriculum that align to the Common Core State Standards.           Assistant Principals and Principal attend professional development sessions conducted by the NYCDOE and   BFSC regarding the CCSS throughout the year.

Not applicable.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     At WHSAD, weekly professional development sessions and weekly department meetings serve as forums to  emphasize effective classroom instruction. As student product must reflect instruction and student self-assessment,  assessment is an implicit focus at every meeting. Because there is an expansive cross-section of talent and experience  on the WHSAD teaching staff, administration invites teachers to lead meetings and to share best practices with their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local     0     0    0    3,926,096     Column B   Section Reference(s)  Part 4a all sections     Not applicable     Not applicable     Not applicable     Part 4a all sections        Not applicable     Not applicable     Not applicable     X         colleagues.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   377,109   X   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Williamsburg High School for Architecture & Design, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Williamsburg High School for Architecture & Design will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand         School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Williamsburg High School for Architecture & Design ,in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      support of student achievement between the school and the families.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Our CBOs will be conducting career and college planning during the school day for all students in the school. The  overall impact is for our students to be able to map out their postsecondary plans and tailor their experiences while in  high school to meet these goals.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By the end of the 2017-18 school year, no less than 275 students will have participated in a minimum of 90 hours of  community school programming provided by our CBOs.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Engaging all of our students with entrepreneurship and college and career planning opportunities will provide them  with academic goals in order to meet their postsecondary goals. Our community service activities will also provide  them with soft skills and activities to list in their resumes to make them more marketable in the world of work.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to  support your school’s instructional focus.

Part 3 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 3a. Indicate resources your Community Partnership will leverage to achieve your summative SMART goal(s) and  implement this action plan, including human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      The Community Partnership (in addition to the Community School Director), will provide a team of four coaches, each  who will be assigned a grade level to teach students of all levels a cohort-tailored curriculum. In addition to this, the  partnership will work in collaboration with another CBO called Health for All to build on the school's community  service and health & wellness programs. Class schedule adjustments were made in consultation with the Assistant  Principal overseeing guidance and school programming.         Part 3b.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   1. Creative Connections will vet candidates for the Community School Director. Their recommendations will then be  interviewed by the principal, who makes the final recommendation. The Community School Director speaks with the  school leadership team to coordinate the community school activities.      2. The Community School Director meets with school leadership daily, and with the guidance counselors and  classroom teachers weekly, to make sure that the right services are provided to the right students and families at the  right time. Coordination of these services are discussed daily between school administration and the Community  School Director.      3. The Community School Director conducts a survey to families in order to gauge the types of family programming  offered during the school year. This enables the school to get maximum family participation to workshops and  programs that are most meaningful to the school’s families.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         4.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The formative assessments used are academic conversations, graphic organizers, gallery walks, student generated questions  from peers and one-on-one student teacher conferences. This information helps teachers target instruction in specific areas  such as reading and writing, vocabulary and grammar     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The administration plans a school-wide interim assessment calendar at the beginning of each school year. Students are tested  in each of their classes (including ENL classes) at the end of each interim assessment period. There are six interim assessment  periods per school year (three in the Fall term and three in the Spring term). The ENL periodic assessment is embedded in this  calendar.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments being used to identify baseline progress and areas of need are interim assessments, performance  tasks, written assessments, oral assessments, standardize tests, unit tests at the end of a unit and peer feedback. The data  from these assessments predict how students will do on the NYSESLAT and identify areas where they have yet to meet  proficiency levels.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are schoolwide protocols in place to address intervention should a student not meet certain benchmarks: standalone  ENL classes, integrated ENL/ELA classes, and standalone ELA classes follow these protocols: If a student is deemed not to meet  a benchmark (as determined summative data that has been gathered -- i.e. the six interim assessments), the student is  discussed at teacher cohort meetings to establish possible impediments to student learning and/or to pinpoint areas where  student may need targeted assistance. In partnership with the student's guidance counselor and school social worker, an  intervention plan is drafted that may include counseling and/or academic support (such as dedicated tutoring sessions, office- hour appointments with teachers) to support the student.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable. Our school does not teach grades K to 5.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As measured by the NYSESLAT scores reported on the RLAT report from ATS, students in all grades are on average more than  twice as proficient in the modalities of 'listening', 'speaking', and 'reading' than in 'writing.' This outcome assessment informs  what school administration believe is true of all students schoolwide: the need for students to be able to articulate their ideas  through writing, and to be able to support their ideas through writing, as an exercise to develop critical thinking. This  assessment informs not only ELL programs, but that of all academic programs.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher and Assistant Principal overseeing ENL communicate the findings to school programmers so that they may  accommodate the mandated instruction required for each student, according to their proficiency level and as outlined in CR  Part 154.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In the Integrated classroom the students receive core content and language development instructions. Included with  these instructions are translations in native language for support. Students receive instructions that support their  culture and diversity in order to enrich comprehension. The classes are co-taught by the ENL and core content teacher  who work together to ensure that all students get the support they need.       For stand-alone the student receives instruction from the ENL teacher separately. This instruction provides support  to re-enforcement the instruction in the core content classroom.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49           Students are grouped in heterogeneous groups.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Staffing and class programming ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the  proficiency level of our ELL student population. We have two ENL certified teachers on staff to accommodate the mandated  number of standalone ENL instructional minutes.  Students requiring ELA minutes, as per CR Part 154, are taught ELA by an  appropriately certified teacher. School programmers create integrated ENL & ELA classes to allow for more flexibility in  programming, while simultaneously addressing the mandate.     Students are programmed based on how they are scored on NYSESLAT in the prior year: Entering get 3 periods of standalone  ENL & 1 period of integrated ENL/ELA; Transitioning-level students get 1 period of ESL &  1 period of integrated ENL/ELA;  Expanding-level students get 2 periods of integrated ENL/ELA. Commanding students get 1 period of integrated ENL/ELA.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area is delivered in stand-alone classes, with English as the instructional language.  Differentiated instruction is used  to make content comprehensible and to make assignments geared toward different learning styles, including ELLs. Techniques  used to differentiate instruction include (but are not limited to) flexible student grouping according to proficiency in  modalities, timed reading, student pairing for out-loud reading, peer writing corrections, student readiness.  Materials that are  used in ENL classes include graphic organizers, laptops, Smartboards, periodicals, magazines, video, media to immerse  students in target language: English. Our school does not have a push-in ENL teacher. Subject (content area) teachers inform  the ENL teacher if any ELL students require assistance; the ELL student then meets with the ENL teacher on a one-on-one basis  to address content by simplifying the language and providing supplemental resources. Native language support: Spanish- speaking teachers are available to address native language support since most ELL students are Spanish-speaking. Teaching  staff who are fluent in other languages assist. School would enlist the assistance of outside contracted vendor for students  who need support in languages not supported in-house.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We evaluate a student's native language at minimum in the following ways: 1) Newly entitled Spanish-speaking students are  administered the Spanish LAB to evaluate their literacy level, and 2) All ELLs have the option of taking the translated version of  a Regents examinations, provided that the exam is available in translation.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE - We provide a buddy system and the ENL teacher works closely with guidance counselors and other teachers as we  collaborate to support these students. ENL teacher also offers extended office hours to accommodate students and she  provides sheltered instruction that focuses on visuals and demonstrations to ensure they are understanding the content. We  also focus on learning strategies that can be useful in the future.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50        b. Newcomer – We provide a buddy system, we utilize manipulates, visual props, cooperative learning groups, model activities  for students, different hands-on activities, translation of content in native language and peer helpers.     c. Developing – Teacher provides many instances for repetition, instruction is differentiated so students get a chance to see,  hear, discuss content.  They are given opportunities to express their ideas in English and their native language. Teacher  provides clear, step by step instructions of tasks and provide a variety of techniques to support their understanding.     d. Long Term - ENL teacher provides these students with a rigorous, relevant curriculum and maintains a supportive  relationship with students.  These students are given home language support, language development and literacy  development while learning English.     e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status – These students are monitored by the ENL teacher through formal and  informal visits.  They are supported every step of the way and if there is a decline in academic standards the ENL teacher  works with the core content teacher to scaffold instructions and by having open and continuous dialogue with students.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies the ENL teacher provides are scaffolding, purposeful student grouping in class, making sure  students can relate to what's happening in the classroom so that instruction is purposeful, ensure that students have  background knowledge of the topic to be discussed in class, encourage classroom discussions.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT ELA classes (instructional co-teaching class) , where there is an additional teacher to meet their  educational needs. We also offer a office-hours style tutoring program for additional assistance. ICT classes are of a 60 :40  ratio, 60% is general ed and 40% is Special Ed. This ensures that SWD students spend the amount of maximum time with non- disabled peers in a least-restrictive environment. Programming ensures that ELL-SWD are placed in as many ICT classes as  possible, thereby ensuring maximum exposure to general ed students while at the same time being in compliance with Special  Ed mandates.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas include after school tutoring, peer tutoring, co-operative  learning, differentiated instruction. These intervention programs are offered in English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Making ELLs autonomous learners.  Integration of more culturally relevant materials in the classrooms.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Due to their success, none of the current programs/services for ELLs will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are offered access to all school programs including Architecture and Design classes provided their program can  accommodate it.  ELLs also participate in dance, photography, yearbook clubs after school when they are available, as well as  ACE, an internship program, and academic intervention services (AIS). ELL students are encouraged to participate in life-skills  learning by participating in fundraising and student government activities conducted by ENL teacher. Regents tutoring sessions  are also available to ELLs who require assistance in core subjects.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The 'Penguin ESL Reader' series, the 'Language and Literacy' series, Smartboards,  mobile computer labs (laptop carts), LCD  projectors, overhead projectors, CD and DVD libraries, textbooks, newspapers, novels, anthologies, poetry, maps, graphs are  examples of materials used in ENL instruction.  These materials are used non-discriminantly across all ELL subgroups,  proficiency and grade levels, and are utilized to support areas where student need is greatest (i.e. additional vocabulary  projects would be assigned if assessments determine that students do not meet benchmarks). Under the differentiated  approach to instruction, the ELL student determines the materials used to enhance his/her experience in the classroom.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support include dictionaries, glossaries, translators, and a diverse staff who speak numerous languages.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Age level: ENL teacher previews the texts and AV materials (i.e. film, websites, articles, etc.) to determine if the content and  level are appropriate for and comprehensible to a certain age level. Grade level: Teacher takes student feedback into account  to determine level of difficulty or ease, and also to gauge student interest in content.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Through numerous grant opportunities and balanced budgeting, the school as been solvent for the past seven years. Because  of this, it has been capable of outfitting classrooms with multiple technological resources (Smartboards, laptop carts), as well  as providing  traditional resources (ENL libraries and level-appropriate reading material) and staff (academic and guidance) to  support all aspects of a student's learning and well-being, including students who happen to be ELLs. Even though the school is  co-located with two other schools, there has not been a dedicated need to share resources beyond services provided by the  campus SBST team.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Incoming ELL students are invited to Freshmen Orientation. As part of the program, they meet current ELL students and  ENL/ELA instructors, and learn what to expect when they start their high school careers. Guidance counselors and the parent  coordinator (who is fluent in Spanish and Cantonese) present as well. Before the end of their visit, they given the ELA teacher  distributes an optional summer assignment that includes a recommended reading list.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable. Our school does not offer a dual-language program.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Assistant principals conduct weekly professional development meetings for all teachers and support staff of ELLs (including  ENL, bilingual, special education, subject area teachers & paraprofessionals) that focus on teaching Common Core Learning  Standards, as practiced through differentiated instruction, curriculum mapping, backward planning, and the use of media in  the classroom. Because of WHSAD's focus on differentiated learning, best practices like common planning time between  teachers is encouraged and reinforced as part of the school's PD program to support the individual student, whether he/she be  a SWD, an ELL, or both.   Title III funds permitting, WHSAD intends to procure the services of a literacy coach to provide feedback and support for ELL  personnel. This professional development plan for ELL personnel is designed to engage ELL students in writing in English, as  required by Common Core Learning Standards. Our ELL PD regimen specifically targets these skills because they reflect the  modalities in which our ELL students demonstrate least proficiency. In the past, Title III funds have afforded a monthly session  with a literacy coach for our ELL personnel. We would like to repeat this practice this year.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Pending.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design has an annual Parent Night where the ENL teacher can discuss the  program with parents, inform parents about the different assessments administered, and inform them as to whether  their child is progressing. ENL teachers discuss the texts students are expected to read as well lead as a discussion about  the NYSESLAT that all ELLs have to take at the end of the year to see if they are ready to test out of the ENL program. Staff  members are present at these meetings to provide translation and interpretation if the parents are not able to speak or  understand English.     The set up for the ENL Parent Night is as follows: In the classroom the ENL teacher, the translator and Core Content teacher  displays to parents all the materials that will be used for the year. There is also a slide show presentation that highlights how  standard classroom instruction is delivered. Parents play games that mimic some of the games that are played in the classroom  so that they can better understand how topics are taught. There is a questions-and-answer segment where parents can ask  questions or voice concerns they might have.  At the end of the session, the ENL teacher and the translator make themselves  available to answer any questions parents might still have about the class or the program.     If parents are unable to come to ENL Parent Night, letters are sent home with the content of the presentation in English and  with a version of the content translated in the student's home language (with assistance from the DOE's Language Line or  contracted language interpretation/translation vendors). The ENL teacher also follows up with a phone call to answer any  questions or to inquire if parents would prefer to arrange another meeting if they were unable to come in, or to address any  questions parents may ask over the phone.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parent Coordinator is present at all PTA meetings to field questions from families who have difficulty communicating in  English. The school encourages ELL parents participate in school activities such as the Architecture Parent Portfolio Nights,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Awards Night, Spring Arts Festival, school trips, and school performances, all of which are advertised via monthly newsletters  that are sent home in English and Spanish (which is the home language of a great majority of our ELLs). Guidance staff and  teachers often request the Parent Coordinator, who speaks fluent Spanish and Cantonese, to make calls to families of ELL  students or to provide interpretation services for visiting families. The school notifies the DOE Translation Unit, or procures the  services of an interpreter from a DOE-contracted vendor if enough advanced notice is given, if communication with a family  cannot be accommodated in-house. The goal of these services is to foster a welcoming environment for parents of ELLs and for  parents with limited English proficiency.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gill Cornell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Williamsburg HS for Architectu                                                                              School DBN: 14K558  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our school distributes the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and the Parent Written/Spoken Language  Identification form to families of students who are missing these indicators in ATS, as per the Data Integrity Score  Card (DISC), which is checked on a regular basis. Both English and Spanish versions of these forms are distributed  to meet the needs of a majority of our student population; these forms are also available in other languages, upon  parental request. Emergency cards are also distributed to parents in other languages upon request. The  information from these forms is used to update the student's and parent's preferred written and spoken language  indicators in ATS.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Arabic   Bengali   Chinese   Estonian   French   Fulani   Guarani   Italian   English   Polish   Slovak   Spanish           6   4   8   1   3   0   1   0   589   9   1   263   .68   .45   .90   .11   .34   0   .11   0   66.55   1.02   .11   29.71   6   8   7   1   3   1   1   1   584   9   1   263   .68   .9   .79   .11   .34   .11   .11   .11   65.99   1.02   .11   29.72   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     No languages other than English exceed 10% of the population except Spanish (29.72%).          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, the parent coordinator programs (which can be done remotely) a message in  English and Spanish on her office phone voicemail detailing the emergency and whether they should call her via her  parent coordinator cell phone for more information. Following the state of emergency, upon guidance from DOE, the  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      school issues letters detailing the nature of the event written in the home language of the parent. The school would  procure translation services for correspondence in languages not immediately supported by the DOE (Arabic, Bengali,  Chinese, English, French, Haitian-Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Urdu).            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Business Manager meets with Main Office staff, Parent Coordinator, and Attendance Coordinator, at the beginning of  each school year and addresses procedures for greeting parents with limited English proficiency and the DOE  resources available for their use (i.e. posters to help identify language, the Language Line service, etc.). At the first  Professional Development session of the school year, administrators advise teachers and guidance staff to reach out  to the Parent Coordinator, who is the school Language Access Coordinator, for assistance with interpretation and  translation services. Because she is tri-lingual (English, Spanish, Cantonese), the parent coordinator is usually able to  handle the request in-house. Teachers are advised to make use of DOE resources directly (i.e. posters to help identify  language, the Language Line service, and with enough advanced notice requesting on-site interpreters). if the parent  coordinator cannot field the request either due to the language requested, or due to her unavailability. It is  communicated to the teachers that the school can purchase translation or interpretation services from a DOE- contracted vendor with enough advanced notice.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The "Welcome" and "Parent Guide to Language Access" posters are placed in prominent locations in Parent  Coordinator's office, Guidance Counselor offices, Assistant Principal offices, and in the Main Office whereby parents  can indicate their preferred language. Brochures and flyers advising parents' right to translation and interpretation  services are mailed home at the beginning of the school year as part of the first monthly newsletter, written in the  parent's language. Parents are also informed of the availability of translation services during PTA meetings, which are  always attended by parent coordinator who is tri-lingual, and which makes use of the Language Line and contracted  interpreters if requested. Language interpretation services are also purchased for parent events (particularly Parent  Teacher conferences) to accommodate requests made with enough advanced notification.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The School Environment Survey (which the DOE automatically prints in the home language of the parent) and monthly  PTA meetings (for which the school ensures staff members who speak various languages are present, or use Language  Line if they are not) serve as forums by which all parents (inclusive of all cultures and languages) have an opportunity  to voice whether they feel the school effectively communicates with them. At the end of the academic year, the  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         school reviews results from the School Environment Survey to gauge overall whether parents feel included and  whether they feel there is a spirit of trust and inclusion in the school. Staff who regularly interact with parents,  especially teachers, speak to parents in their preferred language if they are fluent, and make use of Language Line if  the translation cannot be accommodated in-house. In response to parent feedback, the school has ensured staff is  made aware of the procedures for parent translation and interpretation requests so that parents are by extension  made aware of their right to these types of services.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61
