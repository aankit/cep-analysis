This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Institute for Health Professions at Cambria Heights (IHPCH) strives to help each student attain an individualized  education consistent with the values of leadership, scholarship, and service through building relationships between  students, parents, staff, and community partners. Students become artists, historians, scientists, mathematicians,  literary scholars, and healthcare workers by learning to do the work of these disciplines. Collaboration and teamwork  are essential elements of an education at IHPCH. The faculty works collaboratively to ensure that students’ needs are  being met by constantly learning about the most effective types of instruction and supports to help students meet   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      their learning goals. Students and their families are integral members of IHPCH team. Through advisories, students  form important relationships with the faculty and play an important role in designing their educational experience.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Institute for Health Professions at Cambria Heights is a progressive Career and Technical Education high school  that offers students the chance to earn New York State certification as an Emergency Medical Technician-Basic  Original or earn college credit as part of our pre-nursing program during their four years of high school. The school is a  member of the New York Performance Standards Consortium and is partnered with Northwell Heath and Hofstra  University. Northwell Heath provides professional development for teachers and provides opportunities for students  to learn at the Center for Learning and Innovation. Hofstra provides students with access to their campus so that  students are exposed to the world of college. Together, Northwell Heath and Hofstra provide opportunities for  students to meet current health care professionals and students studying to become health care professionals  through career days.   The school’s strengths are our restorative justice practices for relationship building and discipline, credit  accumulation, college exposure, community service, and project-based academic program that culminates with  students presenting graduation-level Performance-Based Assessment Tasks. Some of the challenges are improving  student's use of our school's Habits of Mind and Character Principles, the level of discourse using academic language,  providing all of our students with disabilities and English Language Learners with multiple entry points, and  differentiated instruction.   During the upcoming school year, the school will work with the Heckscher Foundation for Children, College Access:  Research and Action (CARA), College Access for All, 100 Schools Project, and the Cross Island YMCA. CARA, which is  funded by a grant from the Heckscher Foundation for Children, and College Access for All will support students and  their families in being exposed to the different post-secondary options that are available. Parents in particular will be  invited to attend trips to colleges and universities with their child to learn about the range of options available to their  child. Through the 100 Schools Project, we hope to support improved student achievement while raising awareness of  mental health issues.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school is currently 8% English Language Learners and 10% students with disabilities. Our current ELLs speak six  different languages and need support learning basic English speaking skills, phonics, and more advanced literacy and  numeracy skills on par with native English speakers. Our students with disabilities require extensive support in  literacy, numeracy, and emotional support. Literacy needs include decoding, inferencing, using context clues, and  writing cohesive sentences and paragraphs. Numeracy needs include mathematical thinking and foundational algebra  skills. Some students with disabilities require support managing their emotions.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on our most recent School Survey, we have made the most progress in Strong Family-Community Ties. Our key  area of focus is Collaborative Teachers.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q243   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   420   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Quality Indicator: 1.2 Pedagogy      Findings  Across classrooms, the school’s belief that students learn best when engaged in project-based collaborative work and  discussions is evident.     Impact  High levels of student thinking and ownership during instruction are not present across the vast majority of  classrooms.     Supporting Evidence     Peer assessment was the learning task in a social studies class. The Habits of Mind interpretation and         communication were highlighted in a process that included a protocol that required the use of a rubric. In one  group, a student pointed out that some background details included in the introductory paragraph actually  belonged later in the body paragraph and that her focus should be to catch the attention of the reader in the  opening paragraph. Other students spoke of needing to analyze evidence to support their arguments.  In a science lesson focused on advanced research and writing, students were collaborating on topics that they  selected based on shared interest. They explained that they were engaging in background research that  would inform their hypothesis. They understood that they would then test their hypothesis in an experiment  that they would have to design. One group was exploring the question, “Does pressure have a negative or  positive affect on athletes?” This level of student clarity and ownership of the learning task was not reflected  in most classrooms.  Students in an English class were creating artifacts and engaging in writing in preparation for a class museum  that related to the Holocaust. Teachers circulated and guided online research efforts, coached artifact  development, pushed students to make connections to a recent trip to the Holocaust museum and  encouraged students to use a check-list that outlined their steps toward completion. Though all students  understood that their artifact was related to the Holocaust, few could articulate why their choice was  symbolically significant enough to warrant being included in the museum. Similarly, in a science class,  students seated in groups completed their data tables and discussion sheets related to their physics PBAT  involving the study of velocity, mass, angle, force and energy through the construction of catapults. Students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      were able to discuss their construction processes as well as questions embedded in the lesson such as, “How  did the variable you studied relate to the motion of the object?” and “If you were not successful, what does  your data show that you could change to make your catapult successful?” Student ability to interpret and  predict showed high levels of thinking, however a number of students were unable to connect their learning  to contexts outside of the catapult experiment. In both cases, ownership of knowledge so that it could be  applied and articulated at deeper levels was limited.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Quality Indicator: 1.4 Positive Learning Environment   Findings  Members of the school community purposefully build school culture and provide social-emotional supports. They  maintain the school’s culture through the alignment of professional development and student learning experiences.     Impact  Safety, inclusivity and respect are integrated into the school’s culture, which promote effective academic and  personal behaviors.     Supporting Evidence         Students agreed that one of the reasons why they feel safe and respected at the school is the Fairness  Committee. Select students are trained to serve as facilitators of the committee. A student noted that when  someone in the community is “harmed,” they can bring the person that they are in conflict with before the  Fairness Committee to resolve the issue. The committee determines an appropriate next step or  consequence. A member of the staff noted that though it is rare, the school culture allows for students to  bring a faculty member before the committee. Students’ willingness to engage in this restorative justice  process demonstrates a connection to the school and those who make up its community. (QR)  Student voice is honored in a number of ways. Student government runs the school store and raises money  for student activities. The students also feel heard through clubs based on their interests. A dance team,  fitness club and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) club were all initiated by students. (QR)     During a weekly schoolwide community meeting, school leaders had select seniors stand as their names were   read along with the colleges they were recently accepted into. The entire school community applauded and  cheered as their peers stood. It was stated that names would be shared in this fashion as the list is updated  weekly. A tenth grade student was acknowledged because he was going to transfer from the school. The  community applauded and wished the student well as he stood and waved. Character principle awards were  given out by staff to students, by students to students, and by students to staff. Such acknowledgements  support healthy relationships amongst staff and students. (QR)     Teachers receive training on how to be effective advisors during semi-monthly advisory team meetings. This   professional learning addresses skills such as helping students develop individualized learning plans,  advocating and supporting academic performance, and communicating with parents. Teachers also engage in  weekly cross-grade conversations focused on student social-emotional well-being and the support of  behaviors that can enhance learning. A teacher shared that teachers leave these discussions with strategies  and tools to support specific students whose success may be hindered by social-emotional factors.

Quality Indicator 4.2 Teacher Teams and Leadership Development      Findings  The majority of teachers engage in professional collaborations using an inquiry approach. Distributed leadership  structures are in place.     Impact  The work of teacher teams does not yet result in schoolwide instructional coherence or increased student  achievement for all learners. Though teachers have a voice, they do not play an integral role in key decisions.      Supporting Evidence     An English team meeting began with the review of a consultancy protocol. This was followed by the   presenting teacher outlining his instructional dilemma, which was how to effectively design an interim  assessment that would prompt students to successfully interpret quotes and use outside sources to support  their claims. The facilitator and other team members veered away from the agenda of assessment design and  into instruction as they inquired about teaching strategies and the use of scaffolds. Eventually the  conversation returned to the interim assessment and a recommendation was made to highlight the research  component’s role in informing students’ arguments. Though the meeting was aligned to the school’s goal of  embedding college readiness and higher order thinking skills into instruction, and the presenting teacher left  with a suggestion that strengthens his instructional capacity, the execution of the meeting hindered the  degree to which the presenting teacher was supported in a coherent fashion.     Minutes from a social studies team meeting focused on providing a teacher with feedback on the design of a   Performance Based Assessment Task (PBAT), collegially sharing by acknowledging strong elements and  providing suggestions to improve other areas. A positive point of feedback was that the debate topic was  interesting and connected to students’ lives as it related history to modern day contexts. A recommendation  for improvement included the need to provide students with research resources to help facilitate work done  during class time. Minutes from other teacher teams showed that they all use similar protocols and structures  to engage in inquiry-based professional collaborations. However, the detail with which feedback and project  suggestions were memorialized varied, limiting schoolwide coherence in this practice.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21        One of the areas within which teachers have the most voice in decision making is professional development.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The staff uses our personal and professional connections to identify highly qualified candidates to work at the school.  As an Northwell Health and Hofstra University partner school, we advertise for open positions through these  institutions. We also attend various recruiting fairs allowing us to choose from a varied and highly qualified candidate  pool. We have student teachers from Hofstra and Queens College come do their mandatory teaching practicum at our  school. As a result we will be able to hire a great number of highly qualified graduates. We are a member of the New  York Performance Standards Consortium, which provides our teachers with professional development opportunities  outside our school in the form of subject area workshops, networking, and inter-visitations. Moreover, being a  member of the consortium means we are part of the group’s list serve which allows us to advertise positions to other  consortium schools and staff.   Our school has a hiring committee which follows thoughtfully developed protocols and interview guides in our search  for highly qualified and talented staff. The committee is comprised of the school leadership as well as veteran and  new teachers. Qualified candidates must pass though several rigorous stages before being hired. First, candidates are  screened in a phone interview by a committee member. Subsequently, desirable candidates are invited to a personal  interview with the committee at the school where they also receive a school tour. Finally, our top candidates are  invited to demonstrate their teaching abilities and skills interacting with students at a demo lesson. We have found  that this process has ensured the recruitment of the best possible staff.   Staff at IHPCH participates in weekly school wide professional development meetings to discuss, among other things,  teaching strategies, curriculum design and methods for effectively working with individual students. With the addition  of JumpRope, which allows us to track each individual student’s skill and content mastery across assignments, units,  semesters, and from year-to-year, we believe that we will be able to attract teachers who share our commitment to  addressing the particular skill and content needs of every student. This is offered to teachers who wish to obtain  certification or extensions in other subject areas or for teachers’ general development.   Finally, school leadership matches teachers’ professional goals with coaches from the Institute for Student  Achievement, allowing teachers to work with a coach whose area of expertise is in areas where the teacher  wants/needs to grow. Through the teacher team structure, teachers are also able to take ownership of school  practices which keep them invested in the school’s continual improvement.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   In addition to the professional development opportunities described in the previous section, the IHPCH faculty  participates in the following professional development to enable all students to meet CCLS:   1. Curriculum Review: Humanities and STEAM Departments hold curriculum review meetings in the fall and the spring  semesters using the NSRF Tuning protocol and Tri-State Rubrics. This includes a review of common core aligned scope  and sequence in departments and insures that every curriculum plan is designed around students demonstrating  mastery of CCLS and the school’s core values.   2. Analysis of Lesson Plans, Assessments, and Student Work: In departments and grade teams, teachers together  review and analyze lesson plans, assessments designed by teachers, and student work, in connection to data on  student mastery of skills and content aligned to the CCLS. The faculty uses the Tuning Protocol and Tri-State Rubrics to  evaluate the lesson before it is taught. After the lesson is taught, the faculty uses the Consultancy Protocol to evaluate  the lesson’s success based on student work.   3. Inquiry Teams: 100% of teachers will engage in inquiry work to pursue a problem of practice, connected to the  CCLS, unique to their classroom using the Tuning and Consultancy protocols.    4. Jumprope: Jumprope is our student information system used to track student mastery of CC aligned content and  skill standards. PD insures that teachers know how to accurately report student mastery of content and skill  standards; how to use Jumprope to identify student performance on skill and content standards; and use this data to  inform instructional decisions.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.           Teachers meet with their grade and department teams twice per month. Team leaders meet with the principal once  per week. Teachers collaborate to backwards plan Performance-Based Assessment Task (PBAT) performance  indicators so that grade specific expectations are clear to the entire staff and students. Teachers plan PBATs and pre- PBATs for their individual classes based on the course theme and the PBAT rubric.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Institute for Health Professions at Cambria Heights, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Institute for Health Professions at Cambria Heights will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40         The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Acceleration,  which meets Monday through Thursday, before or after school for the entire school year, for 45- 60 minutes,  jump-starts underperforming students into learning new concepts before their  classmates even begin. Rather than being stuck in the remedial slow lane, students move ahead  of everyone into the fast lane of learning. Acceleration provides a fresh academic start for  students every week and creates opportunities for struggling students to learn alongside their  more successful peers. Acceleration strives to help students understand:  -The real-world relevance and purpose of the concept.  -Critical vocabulary, including what the words look and sound like.  -The basic skills needed to master the concept.  -The new skills needed to master the concept.  -The big picture of where instruction is going taught in English using the same materials students  use in class.    -All immigrant students participate in the program as needed.    -ELLs participate in acceleration with the ESL Teacher in addition to their 6-7 classroom  teachers.

Professional Development at IHPCH focuses on teacher teams using protocols to support each  other in planning tasks that meet our project-based expectations. Additionally, teachers look at  student work and solve dilemmas (problems of practice) using protocols. Through these  processes teachers refine their practice and identify high leverage practices that may be used  school wide. The topics include engaging students in higher order thinking using project based  learning, English Language Learner Strategies, supporting students' social-emotional needs,  habits of mind, reading and writing. PD is provided by school staff (teachers and administrators)  and outside coaches during the PD Block on Fridays.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

PTA  meetings cover a variety of topics including mastery-based grading and internship opportunities  available through the school's partnership with the National Academy Foundation. PTA meetings  occur monthly on Saturdays from September to June, for 1 hour. The school also holds a FAFSA  completion night in November when staff support students and their families in completing the  FAFSA application. The Parent Coordinator sends out information from community and  governmental programs. Information includes internships for students, job fairs and educational  opportunities for parents, and financial, legal, or health services.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use teacher created interim assessments to guide instructional planning.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Departmental Common Planning periods four days per week, grade team meetings twice per month, professional  development (literacy, writing) twice per month, and Instructional Rounds.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our program based on successful scores on interim assessments and performance-based  assessment tasks, as well as determining success based on NYSESLAT data. Content area grades are checked weekly;  assessments given in ESL are also used to determine progress.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Acceleration-After School tutoring is provided for students who need additional support. Saturday school provides English  Regents prep for students during the school year. Teachers have common planning four days per week as part of the weekly  schedule. Grade teams meet twice per month to engage in kid talk that includes identifying students who need additional  interventions (e.g. acceleration, parent contact). The ENL teacher conducts PD for teachers on ENL best-practices.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The 2014-15 NYSESLAT results have not yet been released.  We also do not have NYSESLAT modalities for individual students  because they have not been provided.  However, with the data we have so far (2013-14 NYSESLAT results and previous years),  we're observing our newcomers advancing at an expected rate.  However, our long-term ELLs have not progressed primarily  because of writing skills defecits.  As we determine the causes of writing defecits, the information is shared among the general  ed teachers.  For example, one of our long-term ELLs has difficulty inferencing as determined by an informal assessment, and  to support this student we are implementing more inferencing strategies.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Weekly meetings of the department and grade team leaders, SWD team leader, and ENL teacher. Weekly guidance and dean  meetings. Through these meetings, the teams discuss the PDSA cycle and make adjustments.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our ELLs are separated by grade level and then blocked into sections along with general education peers.  This means  they are grouped heterogeneously with regard to proficiency levels.  We have an integrated ENL/ELA model  beause our ENL teacher is also certified in ELA.  In addition, we provide integrated co-teaching with pull-out supports  for Entering and Emerging students.  Our classes run for an extended period and students are with a co-teacher for  some subjects.  To meet the needs of our ELLs at various levels, we are instituting a number of plans.  Entering and Emerging level ELLs will receive ELA courses taught by a dually certified ELA/ESL teacher.  They will  receive pull-out ENL support instruction at least two periods a week to focus on language.  The ENL teacher will push- in to Global Studies courses for both 9th and 10th grades as a co-teacher.  Entering and Emerging level students in the  11th grade will receive push-in supports in Global, as well as 4 periods of integrated ENL/ELA per week.  Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding students, being in the ELL block, will receive push-in supports in tandem  with the earlier level students.  Within the humanities content areas (English and Global), she will provide small-group  instruction in language related to content.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We only have an ENL model.  Our periods are one hour long each.  Students who are entering and emerging will have ENL/ELA  four times a week for an hour each period, with three days focusing on ELA content and one period focusing on grammar (As  Freestanding ESL).  Additionally, two pull-out periods during Advisory or Gym classes will be used to continue Freestanding ENL  support.    Because ESL students are grouped into the same section, integrated ENL/Content area coursework will be done with all levels  during Global History class, with Intermediate and Expanding students joining for at least three periods per week (180  minutes).  Commanding level students will receive integrated content area support along with their peers twice per week.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content in the Freestanding ENL and ENL/ELA programs will be delivered using an inquiry approach that provides multiple  entry points and diffentiated content, process, and product.  We will utilize a project-based learning approach so that students  are working on authentic products while practicing English.  Instruction will be delivered in English with some translation  provided as well as peer support within heterogenous groups (by level).  Students will do ELA with adapted texts that are still  conducive to exploring big ideas.  Writing output will include opportunities to take notes in their primary language and  produce writing products scaffolded using fill-ins, sentence starters, and fill-ins.  Content will be heavily supported using realia  and and visual supports.  Students will support their academic writing growth with unstructured freewriting utilizing both the  old and new languages.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are not evaluated in their home languages because we do not have either a TBE or Dual Language program.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  SIFE students are grouped heterogenously among their classmates and supported in ESL by language level.  We  differentiate by providing resources to build up missing skills and instruction and scaffolding content work to support those  needs.  SIFE students are encouraged to attend extra help if they are experiencing difficulties overcoming gaps.  b.  Newcomers are grouped homogeneously at first, but within a heterogeneous classroom.  Over the course of their first year,  as they acclimate, we begin to separate them to work with stronger more altruistic partners.  In their second year and on they  are grouped heterogeneously among their peers.  Newcomers receive scaffolded work based on their language levels and  what we observe of their needs.  They are welcome to attend our extra help programs.  They are pulled in small groups for  more individualized supports. Their work is more heavily scaffolded (again, based on their level).    c.  Developing ELLs are mixed heterogeneously among their peers and they also receive supports based on their language  level.  They remain in the gen-ed classroom with an ESL coteacher and participate in tiered assignments with their peers that  provide multiple entry points and opportunities to work collaboratively.  They additionally have access to before and after  school activities.  Sometimes, 1-on-1 sessions are provided for students having particular difficulties advancing to higher levels.  d.   With long-term ELLs we make it a point to meet with the student for one-on-one sessions to specifically target areas of  difficulty (based on modalities or on prior observation).  Special attention is given to these students as far as scaffolding and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      adapted content so that the student remains challenged while we deal with the areas of defecit.  These students are also  invited to acceleration, extra help, and Saturday Academy courses to receive individualized supports.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our only classified ELL is a long-term ELL with disabilities in writing, so the SWD teacher provides the majority of her  supports.  All of her materials are grade-level appropriate.  She receives graphic organizers and sentence starters to support  her writing growth as well as being in an ICT room with a special ed teacher.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school provides an ICT model where students with IEPs have a coteacher in every content area class.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school offers Phonics Blitz, a phonics program for students having difficulty decoding language, that provides a special  benefit to ELLs.  We also have acceleration programs that occur before school and extra help after school.  For students  missing interim assessments we offer Saturday Academy as an opportunity for students to make up missing work.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      An integrated ENL/ELA will be implemented for the benefit of entering and emerging level ELLs where they can learn all of the  strategies and skills required in English 9-10 within a curriculum structured around their specific language needs.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   ESL had a Friday meeting where all ELLs would come together and work on projects as a population in and of themselves.  This  proved unpopular with our more advanced ELLs and sometimes an added stress for our lower-level ELLs who preferred to  spend the time in small-group, so we will discontinue that portion of the ESL program.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Before-school Acceleration and after-school extra-help are provided to all ELLs as an option and our ELLs frequently take up  the opportunity to work with teachers after school.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs have access to laptops in almost every class; additionally there is a laptop cart for 10 ELLs to have access to as  needed.  Next year, we plan to have a school website that includes internet resources for ELLs to use independently while on  their computers.  Students also have Smartboards in most of their classes.   Students receive instruction on using Powerpoint  and Prezi services to create presentations, as well as a variety of other programs like Picasa, iMovie (with a handheld camera),  and storymaking software.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We only have ENL.  Home language supports are primarily used to support the instruction of English by using some first- language materials and frequent translations of vocabulary words as well as translated instructions.  Students also may take  some notes and freewrite in their primary language.  We plan on including a native language project into the  curriculum.  However, we do not assess students on their growth in the primary language because we do not provide DL or  TBE.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         We align our instruction to the New York Performance Assessment Consortium rubrics, which are themselves aligned to grade  level common core standards; additionally, as a department team we adapt those rubrics to meet the goals that we have for  each individual grade.  To teach grade level skills, we use adapted versions of selected texts.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ELLs have access to laptops in almost every class; additionally there is a laptop cart for 10 ELLs to have access to as  needed.  Next year, we plan to have a school website that includes internet resources for ELLs to use independently while on  their computers.  Students also have Smartboards in most of their classes.   Students receive instruction on using Powerpoint  and Prezi services to create presentations, as well as a variety of other programs like Picasa, iMovie (with a handheld camera),  and storymaking software.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We have a student orientation at the beginning of the school year.  There are also icebreaker games.  Each newly enrolled ELL  gets a support folder to help them begin their year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    For the 2017-18 school year we will be offering Spanish or French to 10th and 11th graders, including ELLs. 10th Graders will  be able to take music.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher will attend PD for at least 50% of her hours.  This includes the 80s minutes of programmed PD time that is  specific to ELL differentiation as well as outside ENL related conferences (LIESOL, ISA).  She also attends a variety PD offerings  given throughout the year by the NYCDOE.  All other educators of ELLs will receive at least two in-school PD sessions given by  the ESL teacher in addition to differentiation PD given by the principal.  They will also attend PD programs specific to ELLs as  provided by the NYCDOE.   ELL teachers attend PD as provided by the NYCDOE as well as attending additional ELL conferences provided by local colleges  and other organizations.   We will plan intervisitations between our school an the International High School at LaGuardia.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         N/A     We will use sign-in sheets and agendas from PD sessions to track PD time.  PD hours are tracked by the individual teachers and  they are responsible for keeping track of their PD hours on a chart.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We will have designated parent time in our schedule in which we will invite parents up for individual meetings to discuss the  goals and development progress within the program.  These will begin after the first interim assessment.  We will use the  Translation and Interpretation phone line as needed to communicate with parents.   If after repeated attempts we cannot  reach a parent, we will attempt to conference by phone.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Next year we hope to involve parents of ELLs in the PTA by having the children act as translators and teaching them PTA- specific language.  Additionally, we host an annual multicultural fair in which the students perform for the parents, and several  of our ELL parents attend and participate (which also functions as a pathway into the PTA).                Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gareth Robinson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      For students already enrolled in the NYCDOE, we determine their languagep preference by referring to records in  ATS. For some parents of long-term ELLs, we ask the parent directly (via telephone, with translater), if they prefer  to receive communications in English or in the language specificed, and adjust our services as needed.   For parents new to the DOE completing HLIS forms at school, we determine their language preferences during an  in-person interview between the parent and at least one pedagogue.   In the instance that we are unsure of a parent's preferences when we need to phone home or send  communications, we consult their blue cards or ATS records. The ESL teacher will retain a list of all students whose  parents prefer communications in languages other than English.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59     2.
