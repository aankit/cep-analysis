This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      PS 397’s Vision Statement:    The Vision of PS 397 is to create and sustain a school culture that encompasses a rigorous instructional program that  is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and one that encourages student engagement by promoting   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      critical thinkers who will be fully equipped with the 21st century skills in preparation for college and career readiness  while meeting their diverse needs.          PS 397’s Mission Statement:   The mission of PS 397 is to support our vision through the development of a safe and nurturing environment where all  students are challenged and encouraged to succeed by implementing a sound and rigorous curriculum which fosters  student engagement and critical thinking. Through the collaborative efforts of a highly qualified and dedicated staff,  P.S. 397 will lay the foundation for our students so that they can become life-long learners and productive citizens of  society.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 397, Foster Laurie is an elementary school with 200 students from grades pre-kindergarten through grade five  located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. Built in 1975 as an open-space school, it houses 1 pre-K class, 2  Kindergarten classes, 2 first grade classes, 1 second grade class, 1 third grade class, 2 fourth grade classes and 1 fifth  grade class. According to our Demographic report from 2016-17, the school population comprises 82.2% Black, 6.5%  Hispanic, 11.4% White, and 3.8% Asian students. Boys account for 50% of the students enrolled and girls account for  50%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-2017 was 93.0%.    Room dividers are used to separate the individual classes. Additionally there is a lunchroom and multipurpose area  with an accordion wall in between. The multi-purpose area serves as a school auditorium and gym. There are  enclosed rooms used for our Pre-K class, Library and Technology Room. The building’s open design was created to  support the “Open Education” theory that was popular in the 1970s. All students at PS 397 are heterogeneously  grouped. P.S. 397 is a multi-cultural school with students whose home language is not English.   Since we are a small school, we have a "family environment" in which all students and their families are embraced by  all members of our staff. Additionally, we have implemented Character Counts Education and TAC-D Programs that  will decrease the number of incidents and suspensions in OORS while improving the attendance and chronic lateness  that exist amongst our students.   Our school continues to strive toward high academic standards for both our staff and students. As a mean of reaching  this end, several initiatives have been established:   ● In September 2016, we implemented a new reading and math curriculum that supported the Common Core  Learning Standards. After extensive collaborative conversations during our teacher teams, and having assessed and  analyzed the various components of four different curricula, we decided to purchase the Wonders Reading and My  Math curricula.   ● School leaders have a close teamwork relationship with the staff where staff is empowered and are provided an  opportunity to voice their opinions on matters that affect them, thus allowing them to participate in shared decision  making.   ● Our teacher teams meet weekly and are working hard to develop our Professional Learning Communities and  engage in structured professional collaborations to analyze assessment data and student work to adjust the  curriculum and instructional practices to increase student growth.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our biggest challenge for the 2018-19 school year, continues to be lateness and attendance. Our Guidance Counselor  attended monthly training sessions on the TAC-D Program which has allowed her to institute strategies to decrease  the number of lateness and improve attendance. With the creation of an Attendance Board that will recognize those  students who have demonstrated perfect or good attendance coupled with teachers' outreach to families when  students are absent two consecutive days or more, we are hoping to notice an improvement in attendance. During  our Parent Teacher Association meetings, we will recognize those students by issuing them award certificates for  perfect attendance.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Since we have several families living in temporary housing, we have given them additional support through our Parent  Coordinator, Social Worker and school support staff.   The student body includes 11.6% English Language learners. The ELL students in grades 3-5 have made significant  improvement in ELA, Writing and Math. 2 out 9 ELL students in grades 3-5 did not meet the cut off scores in ELA. They  all met in Math.   21% of the student body represent our special education students. We have 4 ICT classes from grades K-5. Our ICT  students primarily are receiving 2 periods of ELA and 1 period of Math everyday. They also receive related services in  counseling, OT, PT and speech.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In reference to the "Framework for Great Schools", our focus this year will be to strengthen the "Collaborative  Teachers" Component. Ms. Monteau, principal and Ms. Pena, data specialist, will continue to facilitate professional  development sessions during our Monday professional learning time allotted and sit in on teacher team meetings  during our Tuesday family outreach/teacher team meeting time to emphasize data analysis and looking at student  work using protocols. We will continue our focus on "Rigorous Instruction" by continuing professional collaborative  discussions during our teacher team meetings on our Wonders Reading and My Math curricula while focusing on the  work on Danielson components 3b, 3c and 3d to ensure that all students are exposed to rigor and held to high  expectations.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths:   Based on our 2017-18 Survey Results, 94% of the teachers believe that the school implements a high quality  curriculum aligned to the Common Core that challenges students, scaffolds their experience, and engages students.   92% of teachers reported having resources and tools needed to include multiple opportunities for developing  students' conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and their ability to apply math in context.   93% of teachers were provided with the tools and resources for opportunities to create coherent progressions within  the standards from current grade to next grades so student knowledge/skills build onto previous learning as  foundations for math concepts taught in later years.   93% of teachers communicated that students participated in class discussions at some point.   Needs:   Looking at the June 2018 Instructional Report, we noticed that our students improved on the short and extended  responses in Math. However, there was a decrease in correct answers in the multiple choice answers. Therefore, we  will continue to focus on two-step word problems and multi-step word problems and include fluency in the daily math  lessons. We also intend to focus on improving vocabulary in the content areas.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in Math Fluency and Conceptual Understanding as evidenced by the  benchmark assessments (baseline and MOSL) in grades K-5.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Spirit Committee meets on a monthly basis to determine the  school spirit themes which are conducted on a bi-monthly basis  throughout the school. These activities strive to highlight and  encourage positive behaviors geared to instill confidence within  our students so that they feel proud about their school,  themselves and their teachers.   Across grade levels, teachers will infuse the various themes of  character education into their instruction on a monthly basis as a  mean of taking a holistic approach of linking academic growth to  social-emotional and civic education. The idea is that because  students spend so much time in school, our school offers a  critically important opportunity to ensure that all students get  the support and help they need to reach their full potential while  building their social-emotional development.   In keeping with the Character Education Theme of the Month  Initiative, students who demonstrate behaviors relative to each  theme will be rewarded a scholar dollar as a means of promoting  their social-emotional health and development. As such, PS 397  has created a Character Education Store that provides students  the opportunity to purchase items using the scholar dollars they  earned.   Under the leadership of the Guidance Counselor who attended  monthly training sessions on the TAC-D Program, teachers will  employ strategies from this program in an effort to foster an  environment where absence and lateness are closely monitored  and addressed to improve attendance in the school. At the end  of each month, those students who have demonstrated evidence  of perfect and good attendance will be recognized with their  names being placed on the Honors Board in addition to the  receipt of an award certificate distributed at the monthly PTA  meetings.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Strengths:   The majority of teachers were engaged in structured professional collaborations on teams. Teacher teams meet  regularly to analyze assessment data and student work for students they share. In addition, they use protocols to look  at student work in an effort to make curricula modifications, discuss best practices and surface trends that may be  evident. This type of practice ensures shared leadership that ensures student progress is the major focus.   Teacher voice is also a critical part of the decision making process. Teachers feel a sense of value when they are  included in the decision making. Teachers were provided with an opportunity in their teams to decide on updating the  curriculum map and pacing calendar for our ELA and math curricula for the new school year 2018-19. We decided to  merge our Math Curriculum with Engage NY Math Modules to facilitate planning and instruction in Mathematics.   According to the School Learning Survey, relative to the question as to whether teachers feel that the school fosters a  commitment to student success, school improvement, and continuous professional learning within a culture of  respect, 100% of the teachers at the school help maintain discipline in the entire school, not just in the classroom.   100% of the teachers take responsibility for improving the school.   100% of the teachers feel responsible that all students learn.   100% of teachers design instructional programs together.   93% of teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade levels.   100% of teachers modify instructional activities and materials to meet the developmental needs and learning  interests of all students.   Needs:   According to our recent Quality Review result, our professional learning communities should focus their inquiries  within a longitudinal study where we would follow specific students that represent our population and our  populations of concern (SWD's/ELL's).

Strengths:      According to the School's Quality Snapshot 2015-16:    100% of teachers say that school staff regularly communicate with parents/guardians about how parents can help  students learn.   96% of parents agree that teachers at this school understand families' problems and concerns.    100% of teachers say that they understand families' problems and concerns.       93% of teachers work closely with families to meet students' needs.      94% of parents/guardians are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school.      Needs:   At P.S. 397 there continues to be a challenge of the increase of parental engagement in the school. There is a need for  an increase in the number of parents who attend our school's activities; we believe the more parents attend our  events and activities the more cognizant parents would be of the mandates stipulated by the Common Core and the  implications for learning which ultimately allows them to monitor their child's progress as they transition through the  grades.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  PS 397 Foster-Laurie Elementary School has consistently maintained a staff of 100% highly-qualified teachers for many  years. We have a low turnover rate, which can be attributed to the close-knit structure and positive culture within our  building. With the low turnover, there is a limited need to recruit new teachers, thus allowing us to focus on quality  education as opposed to teacher retention.   Most teachers receive the assignments they request, as teachers who remain on grade become very comfortable and  knowledgeable regarding the academic content and expectations of their chosen grade. There are instances where  teachers are moved to a new grade, particularly in our inclusion classes, where the Special Ed. teachers who move to  new assignments are provided extensive professional development and work closely with administration. They also  work cohesively with their grade level counterparts to enhance the quality and uniformity of instruction.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All staff members will engage in ongoing targeted and differentiated professional development based upon need as  identified in the needs assessment surveys. Professional development will be embedded into the schedule and will  take place on Mondays and Tuesdays on instructional best practices relative to the new curricula Danielson  components, and other critical topics identified by the Professional Development Team.      There will be ongoing professional development for administration and teachers throughout the school year. The  Assistant Principal will continue to attend monthly pre-determined professional development for new Assistant  Principals offered by ELI.      The principal will attend monthly principals' meetings with the superintendent.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         Administration will continue to facilitate weekly professional development workshops with teachers based upon their  needs as indicated in the needs assessment survey aligned to the Professional Development Plan.      Teachers who attend professional development workshops are expected to turn-key the information to the staff.      The special education liaison will attend monthly meetings at the FSC with regards to special education and IEPs as  mandated, and will then share the information with the staff.      The ULIT Coach will also work in conjunction with administration to facilitate training sessions with teachers on best  practices.

Additionally, they are invited to meet their child’s teacher in the  classroom for a more personalized discussion regarding the expectations for the grade and to answer any questions  while listening to parents voice any issues or concerns regarding the Kindergarten curriculum. Our Pre-K and  Kindergarten teachers collaborate during weekly teacher team meetings. In the spring of each year, our Pre-K  students and families visit our Kindergarten classes to preview the next year's learning environment.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     There are certain assessments that are mandatory across the testing grades as well as in the lower grades. In addition  to baseline and benchmark assessments that are administered across the testing grades, teachers decide upon the  administration of unit assessments when the units of study are completed. After data review, teachers determine  mastery of the content taught or the need for further instruction. Teachers on grade levels collaborate regarding  assessments to ensure minimal subjectivity and more cohesive instruction. Teacher teams are constantly working to  modify instruction according to student needs, to ensure multiple entry points are included in lesson plans, and to  create rigorous tasks including questioning and discussion strategies.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K397, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       17K397 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.  literacy, math, and the use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Fountas and Pinnell running records is used to ascertain the student's reading level and fluency. The data indicates that ELLs  perform at lower reading levels and have deeper issues with phonemic awareness and comprehension. The information from  these assessments help inform the school's instructional plan by highlighting areas of need and attention. The assessment  result/data is sued to drive instruction and group the students. Student needs are shared among teachers and used in the  development of an instructional plan.  The instructional plan ensures that students' demonstrated needs are addressed  explicitly.        2.

What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We evaluate the success of our ELL programs based on the results garnished from running records, interim assessments  (Acuity), NYS examinations, NYSESLAT and overall classroom performance and teacher-generated examinations. Additionally,  curricular decisions are made in reference to outcomes relating to data acquired from examinations.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ELL students are serviced by the ELL teacher and the classroom teachers provide differentiate instruction based on the  results of the assessments.  The AIS teacher provide support to the ELL students by using leveled library books that are geared  for the ELL students.  The ELL students also participate in the after school and Saturday programs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The four action steps of implementing the RTI include universal screening, strong core instruction, tailored intensive  instruction and progress monitoring.   The NYSESLAT scores as well as the state ELA and Math exam scores are used for  universal screening.  Next, a strong "Tier 1" instruction is delivered to all students in the general education classrooms by  qualified educators.  We apply the 5 interrelated instructional principles for teachers for teachers of linguistically diverse  populations recommended by CREDE.  Intensive, targeted intervention is provided to support ELLs who are not showing  sufficient progression the skills and/or competencies measured.  Progress monitoring through formal and informal  assessments informs how at-risk students are responding to instruction.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data indicates that as the grade levels increase, the proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT tend to increase as well.  As the  grade level increases, the proficiency levels on the entry exams ,the NYSITELL, generally decrease.  This is indicative of the fact  that the entry exams ,the NYSITELL, in the early grades contains far less reading and writing, so that a student who does not  read may test Commanding(proficient) based on good speaking and listening skills.  In the higher grade levels, the NYSITELL  requires much more demonstrated reading and writing ability.  We also look at the ELA and Math results to determine the  area of strength and weakness of the ELL students.  Based on the data from the test results, we decide on the type of support  we are going to provide to the students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Principal, ENL teacher and the members of the cabinet meet once a month to look at the progress of the ELL students.  Based  on the progress of the student or lack of progress, we decided on any extra support to provide to the students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         In our school's Freestanding ENL program, integrated and standalone ENL services are given to students in blocks of  either 45 or 90 minutes . For Entering and Emerging students, these blocks add up to 360 minutes a week.  For  Transitioning and Expanding students, the blocks equal 180 minutes a week.  Students who have reached the  Commanding level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction for two years after reaching proficiency.  Students  at the Entering level receive 180 minutes in standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Integrated ENL  services take place as a push in service where the ENL teacher co-teaches along with the Common Branch classroom  teacher.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes of standalone, 90 minutes of integrated, and 180 minutes that can be  either of the two models.  Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated and 90 minutes that can be either  model.  For Expanding students, 180 minutes must be integrated ENL, and for students at the Commanding level, they  must receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL for two years after reaching proficiency. The new CR 154 requires that  instructional groups are created with students from two consecutive grades only.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our school utilizes the standalone ENL program model.  Students receive the prescribed amount of instruction as required by  CR Part 154.  Emerging and Entering students are seen 360 minutes a week, which is 8 periods.  They are pulled out of their  classroom for  ENL services.  Transitioning and Expanding ELL students are seen 4 periods or 180 minutes per week.  They are  joined by students who have reached the Commanding level for 90 minutes every week.  In order to provide the minutes  mandated by CR Part 154, students in consecutive grades are grouped together.  Integrated ENL instruction is given through a  co-teaching model.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher holding the Common branch license work in concert with each  other to deliver instruction.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In the freestanding ENL model, all instruction is delivered in English.  Content is taught in English using the sheltered English  model.  We have books available in other languages for newcomers who can read in their native languages.  ELA, Math and  content area subjects are taught in English.  ENL strategies are designed to enable ENL learners to develop language skills in  both social and academic contexts.  Each lesson has a content objective as well as a language objective.  Content area books  are aligned to the common core standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   To ensure students are appropriately evaluated in their native languages, we ask for a comprehensive educational history for  newcomers, we administer the Spanish LAB to Spanish speaking students upon arrival.  We ensure that students have access  to native language versions of all required exams as well as translated content area glossaries.  All staff who work with ESL  students are notified of these measures.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      a) Students who have interrupted formal education have deeper academic needs than students who have received formal  instruction in their native languages.  Their needs go beyond academic and include social behaviors and school norms so that  school assimilation can take place, thus leading toward a greater opportunity for academic success.  The SIFE student can  benefit from a combined approach that includes some one-on-one instruction to meet their most basic lingual needs, some  small group instruction to allow for learning from peers, as well as modeling of appropriate school behaviors.  It is important  that the teacher's time with the SIFE student is filled with meaningful instruction that includes high interest/ low-level  readability literature to attract their attention.  It is also pertinent that the teacher distinguishes student strengths from  weaknesses and capitalizes on those strengths to build self-esteem and confidence in the SIFE learner.    b) For our students who are newcomers or less than three years in ENL, it is vital that they have exposure to content-area  instruction using ESL methodology and supportive materials; so that when they are faced with content area examinations they  have a basis of understanding. Many content-area textbooks (i.e. social studies and science) come with ESL extension activities  for the support of the ELL student.  c) For our long-term ELL’s there is a need firstly to determine the area of greatest weakness. Once the area of greatest  weakness  has been ascertained, programmatic decisions are based on that information, i.e. teaching strategies to fortify the limited  areas through the use of content-area subject matter. For example, if basic phonics appears to be lacking, then instruction  based on that deficiency is provided.  d) For ELL students who exceed the 6-year period of service, great attention would be given to the evaluation of the needs of  these  students. A more extensive look at where the student lacks the most is required to establish if the impasse lies within a specific  content area or an English language arts strand, i.e. reading or writing. If the conclusion supports that the problem stems from  content area learning then more attention must be given to the vocabulary and structure of that subject are to enhance the  learning process. If the weakness is related to reading or writing then consideration must be given to the discovery of a new  program that will address that issue. There is another circumstance that needs to be given contemplation when establishing  the performance of a beyond 6-year ELL in that there may be the possibility of test anxiety leading to low scoring on  standardized exams versus performance in the classroom.  e)    As per CR Part 154.2, former ELLs are students who have exited ELL status for up to two years after testing at the  Commanding level.  They are mandated to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week. Students who are former ELLs are  provided with testing modifications (time and a half) on all interim assessments, Benchmark, and State tests except for the  NYSESLAT.  Former ELLs are also provided with 90 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction each week in the Content Area.  Small  group targeted instruction and one-on-one instruction are used to support former ELLs in the classroom.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Grade level materials used to support ELL-SWDs include the use of technology.  Starfall and Brainquest ESL are computer  programs that allow for interactive engagement aimed at language acquisition.  Leveled readers provide access to grade level  academic content through the Intervention by Design program.  Such readers are aligned with the Common Core and are  designed for SWDs.  Instructional strategies aimed at supporting ELL-SWDs include the use of graphic organizers, visual  supports seen in diagrams, the use of chucking when introducing complex concepts and the focus on building content specific  academic vocabulary.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility are used to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English  proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  A pacing calendar has been used in order to ensure that ELL-SWDs receive  instruction that corresponds with what they are learning in the classroom.  The ENL teacher reviews IEPs for SWDs and plans  lessons according to the students needs.  To minimize time spent out of the classroom, many ELL-SWDs receive integrated  instruction.  Flexible programming is used in placing these students in an ICT setting where they are learning alongside general  education students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Based on the state ELA and Math exam scores, benchmark assessments and running records, ELL subgroups identified as  needing targeted instruction were long term ELLs and ELL-SWDs.     Once the area of greatest weakness has been ascertained, programmatic decisions are based on that information, i.e.  teaching strategies to fortify the limited areas through the use of content-area subject matter.  For example, if basic phonics  appears to be lacking, then instruction based on that deficiency is provided.     For our long term ELLs and ELL-SWDs there is a need firstly to determine the area of greatest weakness.  For long term ELLs  and ELL-SWDs, great attention would be given to the evaluation of the needs of these students.  A more extensive look at  where the student lacks the most is required to establish if the impasse lies within a specific content area or an English  language arts strand, i.e. reading or writing.  If the conclusion supports that the problem stems from content area learning  then more attention must be given to the vocabulary and structure of that subject  to enhance the learning process. For  Science and Social Studies, the ENL teacher works in a guided reading group to help students increase understanding by using  trade books that support the curriculum.     If the weakness is related to reading or writing then consideration must be given to the discovery of a new program that will  address that issue.  There is another circumstance that needs to be given contemplation when establishing the performance of  a long term ELL in that there may be the possibility of test anxiety leading to low scoring on standardized exams versus  performance in the classroom.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We plan to keep all staff informed about our current issues through the monthly staff trainings.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We received a CASA grant to support our ELL students in the Arts in the after school.  The  program will begin on October and  will end in April.  It will include hands on, thematic art projects which are combined with literature as we strengthen language  skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing.  We will include puppet show performances, smart board activities and a  comprehensive review for the NYSESLAT using student workbooks/CD's.  We received a grant for our ELL/SWD that will allow  us to bring Art Residencies into the classrooms.    ELLs are represented in all programs and have equal access to all school programs.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Instructional programs/materials available to ELLs (resources are dependent on available funding):  -Language Power (various levels)  -Leveled libraries consisting of fiction and non-fiction  -Smartboard  -NYSESLAT prep workbooks  -Dictionaries for second language learners  -CDs with music, chants, etc.  -fiction and non-fiction books in students native languages     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         In our ENL classroom, we have some dual language dictionaries that the children have free access to use.  Additionally, we  have technology programs that provide lessons in dual languages, i.e. Internet based programs.  We also have a very small  library consisting of books written in both English and our students' home languages including Arabic, Spanish, Chinese and  Haitian Creole.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our resources and services support our ELLs needs across the grade levels.  The programs we offer are grade specific and age  appropriate.  Additionally, we utilize content area specific materials while maintaining the methodology used to teach ELLs.  Such services and resources are adapted to meet the cognitive needs of ELL-SWDs by referencing the students IEP and  applying strategies designed to support SWDs, such as the use of graphic organizers, visual supports and breaking tasks down  into more manageable steps.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     Instructional programs/materials available to ELLs (resources are dependent on available funding):  -Language Power  -Leveled libraries consisting of fiction and non-fiction  -Smartboard  -NYSESLAT prep workbooks  -Dictionaries for second language learners  -CDs with music, chants, etc.  -fiction and nonfiction books in students native languages     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In the past we have not had a summer orientation for families of ELL students.  Current ELLs may take home a welcome packet  and fact sheet in case they have newcomers in the community that they would be able to assist before the start of the school  year.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?      PS 397 does not offer language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not offer the dual language model at our school.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Ms. Lendore attends monthly PD/workshops conducted by the Brooklyn SouthField Support Center.  Ms. lendore  will turnkey  the information with the staff at PS 397, including special education teachers, speech therapists, occupational/physical  therapists and secretaries.  Teachers will have access to all books materials , ideas and contacts shared at each of the PDs.  This  will help teachers to improve the level of understanding of second language acquisition and provide more effective   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         instruction.  As a result of these professional development sessions, teachers will also be better equipped to give ELLs including  SIFES greater social and emotional support.    During the current year, Brooklyn South ELL support team has arranged a schedule which includes a professional development  meeting each month.                        Brooklyn South ELL support team will be holding trainings for teachers of ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning  Standards.  At such trainings, teachers are given new information from the staff at Brooklyn South ELL support team.  Next,  teachers collaborate in small groups to process, practice and present the new information to the group as a whole.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance counselor, Ms. Merl, assists all students, including ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle  school.  Professional development trainings are provided by the DOE annually to assist guidance counselors in the articulation  process.  These trainings provide updates regarding the process.  Parent workshops are held at PS397 to assist parents in the  process.  Translation is provided as necessary and documents are provided in other languages to support the families of ELLs.   One hour staff trainings which include ENL specific topics take place on a monthly basis at PS 397. Records of attendance are  kept on a staff sign in sheet.  Agendas are covered at the meeting. ENL topics are shared in the same format modeled by the  Brooklyn South ELL support team.  Teachers may be given information and then asked to collaborate in small groups to  process, practice and present the new information to the group as a whole.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents are encouraged, but not mandated to attend an open school night in the fall.  At this time parents may meet one  on one with the ENL teacher to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency  assessment results, and language needs in all content areas.  Translation may be done over the phone or through a staff  member who speaks the parents' home language.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parent involvement at PS 397 includes an open house for all parents, an orientation meeting for parents of identified ELLs, as  well as opportunities to see their children perform at school and to chaperon during field trips.  Parent Teacher Conferences  held during the school year are always an opportunity to keep an open line of communication between the home and the  school.  Translation services available include both written and verbal translation by members of the staff at PS 397, such as  Ms. Anderson (Spanish) and Ms. Monteau (Haitian Creole).  We also may utilize the Translation and Interpretation Services  Unit via phone.  Ms. Anderson, the parent coordinator, keeps records of parent outreach in various situations.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marie Casseus Monteau, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
