This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of P35M/Manhattan High School is to provide each student with an appropriate education in the least  restrictive environment based on his/her diagnosed needs, strengths and interests. The school environment assumes  all students can learn regardless of his/her disability. Every student will improve their academic and social skills level,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      thus providing students with the needed resources to transition from restrictive settings and ultimately to post- secondary opportunities.      The school is accountable to provide a safe, challenging and creative learning environment in which students with  diverse disabilities, who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds, can fulfill their potential.      The school offers a variety of programs, which enable students to earn either a regular or Regents diploma. The  curriculum is determined by the development of an IEP using and/or modifying the approved New York State and City  standards and incorporating feedback from parents, students and the school’s professional staff. The curriculum  integrates all academic areas, technology, related and support services, occupational training, recreational-leisure  activities, behavior improvement strategies and community based-instruction.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.35M: Manhattan High School is an elementary-high school with 320 students from Kindergarten through grade 12.  The school operates over three sites in Manhattan and one in the Bronx. The main site serves students from grade 9  through grade 12. The second site is a day treatment center in a hospital setting and serves students from  kindergarten through grade 12. The third location serves 9-12th grade students at Beacon High School. Virtually all  students have severe emotional and behavioral needs.   Students at P.35M have the opportunity to participate in an assortment of extracurricular activities. The school fields  PSAL teams in Boy Basketball and Girls Basketball. The P. 35M afterschool program provides opportunities for  students to receive tutoring in classwork and homework help. In addition, the school has cultivated a relationship  with ACCES- VR. ACCES-VR provides P.35M students with the necessary supports to succeed in their post-secondary  endeavors.    Teachers at P.35M are provided opportunities to improve their instructional practice. Teachers participate in content  area and grade level meetings with in the school. At these meetings the teachers review best practices and ways to  drive successful instruction. School staff receives weekly professional development from their school based  instructional coach.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school offers a diverse education to students with special needs. Standardized assessment students receive  differentiated instruction to teach them the Common Core Curriculum at their functioning level. High School students  in need of credit accumulation are able to participate in the schools extended day program. These students take  credit bearing classes after normal school hours in an effort to graduate in a timely manner. Students are also  exposed to a wide variety of vocational opportunities. P.35M offers vocational classes in Technology, Culinary Arts,  Cosmetology, and Auto Mechanics. These classes, coupled with the work of a job developer, have led to work  opportunities while in school, as well as successful transitions after high school.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2018-2019 school year P.35M will continue to build on the achievement of last year. Over the last six years  the school has significantly increased the number of graduates. The school will continue to focus on providing  rigorous instruction. The school will also focus on student assessment as means to improve academic outcomes.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10            School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75M035   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08,09,10,11,12 ,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)   304   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

P35M endeavors to provide rigorous instruction that aligns with the graduation requirements of the NYCDOE.  Instruction and curricula is designed so that each student is expected to demonstrate learning at high levels.  Instruction is differentiated to raise the standards based on the learning needs of each individual student, based on  the belief that all students are capable of achieving the same goal of graduating with a high school diploma. Students  demonstrate academic success through credit accumulation in subject areas aligned to the New York State Common  Core curriculum and demonstrate mastery in these subjects by passing Regents examinations. In recent years,  Manhattan High School has demonstrated success in the number of students graduating with a local diploma, Regents  diploma, or, Career Development and Occupational Studies Commencement Credential (CDOS). One area of need in  raising standards for student outcomes is in the graduation rate for students entering the school year with 30 or more  credits graduating by the end of the school year. According to school graduation data, 50% of students who entered  September 2017 with 30 or more credits graduated by June 2018.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

By June 2019, there will be an increase in the graduation rate for students who begin the school year with 30 or more  credits. This will be measured by a 5% increase in the percentage of Seniors that receive a local diploma, Regents  diploma, or Career Development and Occupational Studies Commencement Credential (CDOS) by June 2019.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Teachers and staff at all sites excel in monitoring students’ academic, social, and emotional statuses, as evidenced by  Skedula anecdotals and a reduction in the need for Behavioral Intervention Plans. Efforts to engage and empower  students have been made via a Student Council and a Life Skills class. More can be done, however, to increase student  sentiment of feeling supported, safe, and challenged throughout their high school experience.       Transition preparations across sites are inconsistent and weighted towards the transitioning of outgoing students.  While the organization has made improvements in post-secondary transition procedures by successfully  implementing last year’s action plan to increase student input for IEP transition goals (as evidenced by SESIS data and  teacher feedback), there is still work to be done. Transition support should begin with incoming freshmen by  administering academic baseline assessments during intake. This information can be used by teachers to create more  individualized curricula. Moreover, guidance with respect to adapting to high school, developing daily life skills, and  post-secondary planning should be coordinated by a single adviser assigned to students throughout their academic  experience.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Since the 2014-15 school year, our school has grown in both student and staff population since the opening of a new  site. We now have 4 sites that house various types of populations with various needs. During the 2017-2018 school  year professional development time, staff has voiced a desire to collaborate in interdisciplinary teams and  intradisciplinary teams at all sites. Furthermore, staff has voiced a desire to develop productive collaborative  relationships that are judgement free and foster growth and learning across all disciplines. Based on the feedback  from the 2016-2017 NYC School Surveys, in the domain of “Peer Collaboration”, 71% of teachers agreed or strongly  agreed that, at their school, teachers design instructional programs (e.g. lessons, units) together. Hence, it is  imperative to focus on strengthening our collaboration regarding our curriculum over the next school year and align it  more cohesively with the New York City Common Core Standards, the Scope and Sequences (across all disciplines),  and the needs of the students in accordance with their IEP goals.    The staff has also voiced concerns over feeling disjointed from their counterparts at the various sites. Based on the  feedback from the 2016-2017 NYC School Surveys regarding our “Quality of Professional Development”, 58% of  teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have included  opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools. Hence, there is a need to continue to develop  opportunities for professional growth and learning by creating more cohesive and purposeful professional  relationships by integrating all sites through the utilization of contractual collaborative time during professional  development. It is important for us to use purposeful scheduling to facilitate opportunities for interdisciplinary and  intradisciplinary learning experiences and systematic dissemination of departmental and interdepartmental  initiatives, curriculum, and goals across all sites. Teacher collaboration and professional development with a teacher  collaborative focus, including differentiated professional development opportunities for all school positions, will help  address our school’s weaknesses in the areas of student engagement and collaborative learning among students.    As discussed in the 2017-2018 Quality Review meeting, the reviewer disclosed a concern regarding a lack of  collaborative learning among students. Also, data on Advance indicates that 22% of teacher observations generated a  developing score in the area of 3C: Engaging Student Learning. A need to continue to foster a collaborative working  relationship between various stakeholders at each individual site and a need for a more integrated professional  collaboration among all sites was identified as an area to improve in order to create a more unified and cohesive  approach to curriculum planning and professional development opportunities and experiences. Utilizing this approach  can address the areas of needs for our students by developing curriculum that is both engaging, collaborative,  differentiated, and unified to meet the various needs of the students across all sites and disciplines.      Areas of Needs:   -Differentiated Professional Development Opportunities for all school positions.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18      -“Judgment-free” teacher inter-visitations and Co-teaching opportunities (Intersite and Intrasite).   -Inclusion of related service-providers in collaborative professional development.   -Purposeful scheduling to facilitate opportunities for interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary learning experiences and  curriculum planning.   -Systematic dissemination of interdepartmental and intradepartmental initiatives across all sites.   -End of the year professional conversations and meetings for teachers, paraprofessionals, and related service  providers.   -Team building experiences during contractual professional development time.      Areas of Strength:   -According to the 2016-2017 School Surveys, 87% of Teachers agreed that their school principal, teachers, and staff  collaborate to make the school run effectively.   -Related service providers are integrated into the classroom learning environment and want to continue their  collaborative efforts with all teachers and paras, and continue effective school-home communication.   -Our school uses distributed leadership, including Instructional coaches, IEP coordinators, and site-based IEP teams,  along with regular Administrative leadership to design and implement professional development plans.    -Skedula is utilized by staff to maintain anecdotals on students that can be access by parents, if requested.   -Professional communication utilizing DOE email system.   -According to the 2016-2017 School Survey, 89% the professional development experiences this year has included  opportunities to work productively with colleagues in their school. (Site-specific)      Areas to Improve:    -According to the 2016-2017 School Survey, 71% of teachers will design instructional programs together. We will like  to improve in this domain by 10%, to include interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary curriculum development in and  across all sites.    -According to the 2016-2017 School Survey, 58% of their professional development experiences this year have  included opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools.

Additionally, the school will utilize phone messenger and update the school’s new website to keep  information up to date.   Needs:   1.  Despite the positive responses, as a school we must make every effort to increase parental engagement. Only  22% of the parents completed the survey compared to 51% of parents citywide. Of the 22%, 58% of them said  that they had never had the opportunity to volunteer their time to support the school.    2.  Our turnout for parent-teacher conferences is not high. However, communicating with the school and visiting  the school on other occasions aside from those conferences are developing. We must find a way to reach our  parents across multiple available platforms to help them meet their child’s and our school’s expectations.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0    0    0    0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 035, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 035 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

Of those, 31 (10%) are English Language  Learners. They are served through a Stand-Alone and Integrated ENL program. Every spring,  ELLs at P35M take the NYSESLAT and according to 2018 NYSESLAT, 1 is at the  Entering level, 7 are at the Emerging level, 9 are at the Transitioning English Language Learner  level, 11 are the Expanding level and 2 are at the Commanding level. P35M has four sites, three  in Manhattan and one in the Bronx. Our ELLs are mandated for 12:1:1 configuration. The  represented languages are Spanish,  Dari (Persian), Arabic, Russian and Haitian Creole. All  ELLs are invited to participate in the Title III program and letters will be sent home in English as  well as their native language to inform the parents/legal guardians of our Title III program.  Phone calls will also be made to all ELLs' homes to survey whether there is any manifested  interest to the program. Due to the geographic locations of the students and the fact that some of  them are mandated for "door to door" busing, the program will run at the Beacon school site on  Wednesdays from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m for 23 weeks beginning December, 2018 until May,  2019. One ENL certified teacher, one ELA teacher and one paraprofessional will work in a  12:1:4 configuration in the program. A supervisor will also be present at the site where the  program is run in order to oversee it. Both teachers will co-teach 23 instructional sessions the  same way they do during the day (Integrated model of teaching).  The theme of Title III this year will be:  "Employment and Independent Living Readiness"  According to the "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics" Economic News Release, Thursday April  26th, 2018.  " Of the 2.9 million youth age 16 to 24 who graduated from high school between January and  October 2017, about 1.9 million (66.7% ) were enrolled in College in October. The college  enrollment rate of recent high school graduates in October 2017 was slightly lower than the rate  in October 2016 (69.7%).....  Recent high school graduate not enrolled in college in the fall of  2017 were much more likely than enrolled graduates to be in the labor force (67.4%, compared  with 39.8%). The unemployment rate for recent high school graduate not enrolled in college was  16.8%, higher than the rate of 10.2% for recent graduates enrolled."  The focus will be the transition between school and the workplace. It will concentrate on the  following areas:  The language of instruction for Title III will be in English and, its goal is to prepare students for  the workforce and guide them with the job search process. Most high schools in the U.S.  emphasize college preparation which very often overshadows attention to the actual workforce  readiness and as a result it leaves students quit High School without the knowledge or skills  needed to find and maintain a job.    Title III program will be divided into 5 categories and, each one of them will run about a month.  During the 23 week program, P35M ELLs will learn the following:    Both books will allow for students to consider multiple options through directed research and  questioning.    During the 23 weeks program, P35M ELLS will learn the following:  1: Assess your professional skills and preferences.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   2: Create a plan and set goals.  3: Networking.  4: Find a job.  5: Manage your career.  The following books and materials will be used throughout the course:  "Step Ahead, Your Career Planning Guide" by iSeek Solutions and Goodwill/Easter Seals  Mission Services.  "Transitioning From High School to the Workforce" by Bib. N. Bac  Both books will allow for students to consider multiple options through direct research and  questioning. They are both step-by-step guidelines meant to ease anxieties and stress associated  when entering the workforce.  It is important to remind our ELLs during Title III that taking action is to think about graduating  from school while thinking about his or her career and also think about continuing their  education as well as Training. This mind set will give them an opportunity to increase their  chances of a better position which then will translate into a better salary. P35M ELLS will be  able, with the support of staff and peers develop and strengthen writing, planning, revising,  editing, and speech. It is imperative that teachers and other staff serve as motivators during the  program. They need to be refiners, connectors and challengers.      Title III budget will allow P35M to purchase two laptops which will be used by students to do  research and familiarize themselves with potential employers before even applying for a  position. Materials needed to facilitate the search and stay organized such as Padfolio clipboard  folders and books will also be purchased.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess the early literacy of our ELLs skills, our school uses Scantron Periodic Assessment which is administered at least four  to five times a year. The data provides insights about each student's level of literacy in English. For example, the spelling  inventory can be analysed  to assess students' word knowledge and to plan word study and reading instruction. Not only do  students' spelling errors indicate their spelling ability,but it also reveals what students know about the structure of words, as  well as knowledge that they use when they read as well as spell. Word study instruction in phonics, vocabulary as well as  spelling is based mostly on what is learned in these inventories as well as teacher-made tools such as rubrics, students'  performance is the result of their different ways of learning and taking in information. Standard assessment test scores such as  the New York State Regents are taken at least twice a year. The Wilson Reading program is used for ELLs with lower  functioning levels.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52   P35M staff works as a team to support this effort and there is an open communication line in place between staff members  and administrators as well as parents to make sure all is in place to meet the needs of our ELLs. Our unit coordinator plays a  key role supporting this effort as well as the students' eagerness to succeed. Should students need extra help whether using  technology or simply meeting with a teacher, P35M staff are always available to students in order to accommodate their  needs whenever possible either during school hours or after school.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ENL program at P35M is assessed in a number of ways. The successful improvement of our ELLs on  NYSESLAT each year is a direct indication of their academic success as measured by an appropriate assessment. Also, their  accomplishments in their core content area classes through teacher made assessment tests or yearly portfolios are proof that  they are actively making a rigorous effort in achieving success. Positive feed-backs from parents, teachers, related services  providers and paraprofessionals reflect the effectiveness of our program.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    All staff members working with our ELLs are instructed to keep an open line of communication with our ENL teacher using the  summative data for all students in order to intervene in any way shape or form when necessary. Rubrics which are developed  by our teachers are used to address students' expectations as well as final examinations, term papers, projects, portfolios.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P35M provides students grades K-12 with opportunities of intervention and individualized instructions in order to meet their  specific needs. All students at P35M have an IEP, Individualized Education Program through which specialized academic goals  are developed.  Also, using RTI methodologies, P35M uses Problem-solving and Instructional model as prevention and early  intervention. Our ENL teacher can decide if she should use the Three-Tiered model and whether it be Tier I, Core of  Intervention, Tier II, Double Dose of Intervention or Tier III, Intensive Intervention when looking at a student's IEP as well as  their work and contribution in the classroom.  The Response to Intervention (RTI) frameworks allows our ENL teacher to  determine a comprehensive identification of ELLs at risk for reading  difficulties, as well as monitoring progress in reading over  time using multiple indicators which then translates into better focus on the quality of classroom instruction.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT assessment data for the 2016-2017 school year revealed where our students stand as far as proficiency and  where it is that they need the most help. Across the grade levels, the reading and writing modalities pose the greatest  challenges to our students. One noticeable pattern is that students score higher on Speaking and Listening than on Writing and  Reading.  Our conclusion to those result is mostly explained by the fact that our students have been in the US longer and thus  have acquired BICS allowing them to better perform on those modalities.  This observation than raises the question of whether  or not the NYSESLAT exam being the only measure that determines the status of our ELLs is truly a valid measure for our  students with learning disabilities/needs. When our ELLs test out NYSESLAT with  "Commanding" level in other word  proficient, as per the revised CR Part 154, they are now former ELLs, and must receive 90 minutes of ENL for a minimum of two  years. This means that our ENL teacher must continue to work with the students who have scored commanding/proficient on  the NYSESLAT. Also, our ELL teacher and our P35M teachers will have to work together in order to make sure that our ELLs  students receive appropriate help and support in order to perform better the following year in the NYSESLAT and most  specifically in the Reading and Writing modalities.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers and other school staff members such as counselors are informed of these findings during but not limited to cohort  meetings. Also, emails are sent out to disseminate findings from evaluations. These structures enables every teacher working  with our ELLs to know their areas of strength and areas for growth.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students at P35M are with 12:1:1 student-to-staff ratio classes. Currently, there is no self-contained ENL classes at  P35M. ELLs are served through an integrated program provided by one fully licensed ENL. Our ENL teacher pushes-in  to co-teach with other classroom teachers in most subject areas and makes sure that instruction is aligned with the  needs of each and everyone of our ELLs.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?          P35M implements an integrated and stand-alone ENL program depending on the mandates of each ELL. Entering ELLs  receive one unit of ENL stand-alone and one unit of integrated ENL. Emerging ELLs receive .5 unit of stand-alone along with 1  unit of integrated ENL and .5 unit of either depending of the student's need. Transitioning receive .5 unit of integrated ENL  with .5 of with .5 of either integrated or stand-alone depending on the needs of the students. Expanding ELLs will receive one  unit of integrated ENL. ELLs who scored Commanding within the last two years will receive .5 of either integrated ENL in ELA  or another content area.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      To ensure that students meet the standards and pass the required State and local assessments, our ENL teacher, our ENL  teacher follows the Common Core Learning Standards, the New Language Arts  Progressions https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-bilingual-common-core-initiative) and incorporates ENL  strategies such as the Cognitive Academic Language learning Approach (CALLA, Total Physical Response (TPR), Language  Experience, Whole Language, Graphic Organizers, Portfolios, plus Multi-sensory approaches used in conjunction with  augmentative communication devices and Mayer Johnson picture symbols. The use of technology, including Smart Boards,  IPads, digital cameras and computers is incorporated to give students additional instructional support. ENL materials are  infused throughout all aspects of instruction. The school and classroom libraries include a variety of books of all levels that  reflect the backgrounds, needs and strengths of our ELLs. We also have books in our ELLs native language should they prefer to  read them in their native language. Instructions in the ENL program are delivered in English with the support of an alternate  placement paraprofessional for those students who are mandated for Bilingual Education per their IEP.  At P35M all students  in 12:1:1 classes receive content area instruction within the classroom through a variety of approaches such as small group,  individual and community based instruction. All classroom instruction is delivered in English and all ELLs participate in the  school activities with the added support of of Integrated and Stand-Alone ENL services. Staff members collaborate along with  our ENL teacher and related service providers to adapt the general education curriculum to meet the needs of the students  and assist them in achieving proficiency on State mandated assessments.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     P35M does not offer a bilingual program and ELLs are not evaluated in their home language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Presently P35M has no students with interrupted formal education (SIFE). Should SIFE students enroll at P35M, our staff would  differentiate instruction to assist in developing their language. Our staff would work to develop initial literacy and  communication skills in the students native language. The learning would be done in a nurturing environment  in order to  facilitate language production. The students would receive support from our ENL teacher and an alternate placement  paraprofessional who speaks their native language and English. Different strategies would be use to enhance the learning  process such as Total Physical Response (TPR), the Natural Approach and small group instruction.  Newcomers admitted to P35M would work with our teachers to develop literacy and communication skills in both English and  the students' native language. Students are encouraged to participate in our regular after-school program (PMSchool@P35M)  where various strategies are used to facilitate language acquisition such as Collaborative Learning Approach, The Natural  Approach, the Language Experience Approach, small group instruction as well as one-on-one tutoring as needed.  To support our developing students who have received ENL services for four to six years, a few strategies are used but are not  limited to, such as Total Physical response, Natural Approach as well as continuous small group instructions and Collaborative  Learning Approach. Additionally, these students are invited to participate in our PM school program at PMschool@P35M as  well.  Our long term ELLs at P35M are supported by several instructional interventions such as the usage of technology into the  curriculum as well as the integration of creativity through literacy programs. Additionally, our long term ELLs receive  continuous support through small group instruction.   At this time, three students at P35M have received a proficient score on NYSESLAT and are considered former ELLs. They  will receive .5 unit of study (90 minutes/week) of Integrated ENL for a minimum of two years as well as continuous support  whenever they need it.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All instruction, including ENL  is differentiated based on students' abilities and IEP goals. Methods for differentiation include  small-group instruction, one-on-one instruction, pair-work and hands-on activities. Use of technology such as IPad, Smart  Boards, digital cameras are integrated throughout the curriculum to ensure that content material is accessible and  appropriately modified for all students in order to provide accelerated English language development and learning. The usage  of multimedia technology in order to incorporate pictures or video into the lesson.  Our teachers are able to provide our ELL  students with the necessary contextual cues to understand new concepts. Also, the use of "Document Camera" in the  classroom brings a major advantage which is the ease with which almost anything can be quickly displayed for a large or small  group.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  At P35M, it is our goal to help all students progress in their development and academic success. To achieve this goal, classroom  teachers, cluster teachers, ENL teacher, related services providers and paraprofessionals collaborate daily to create lessons  that are differentiated and Scaffolded to meet the needs of every student. The ENL teacher integrates into self-contained  classes and collaboratively teaches with classroom and cluster teachers, adding their own expertise in addressing our ELLs'  needs through the use of team/co-teaching. This collaborative teaching approach allows for flexibility to adapt their curriculum  to meet the specific needs of each student. It also provides a certain level of flexibility in scheduling as the students are able to  receive mandated services and supports they need preparing them for progression and success.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  It is extremely important that content area material be accessible and comprehensible for all ELLs. Classroom and cluster  teachers collaborate with our ENL teacher to ensure that all lessons and activities are properly differentiated  for our ELLs.  Intervention strategies are used to support all ELLs, from newcomers to long term students. Among the intervention strategies  used to support ELA instruction is the Cognitive Academic language Learning Approach (CALLA), a content based ENL  instruction model. Additionally, ELLs receive support in content areas such as Science and Social Studies, through small group  instruction, hands on learning and one on one instruction. To support ELLs math achievement, the math teachers work closely  with our ENL teacher in order to meet the students' needs as well as tailor  their lessons if needed to our ELLs level of  understanding.All instruction is delivered in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Through the Capital-Funds Grant via the Manhattan Borough Office, our school received funds to upgrade our technology  program and computer lab. New computer programs and softwares will give our students the opportunity to improve their  technological proficiency. All ELLs are not only invited but highly encouraged to take part in all activities within the technology  program.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Our school currently features ENL program only.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are given equal access to all school programs and they are invited to all of them should they choose to join.  P35M makes  sure that all students are treated equally in the building whether socially and/or academically. Our ELLs are taking ELA and  other core content areas just like any other non ELLs. Our ENL teacher works closely and in collaboration with the content area  teachers in order to meet the needs of our ELLs and making sure they feel included.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our ELLs receive support through various instructional materials. Our classrooms are stocked with leveled books and P35M  also has a library which is used by most students and includes books in English, ELLs' native languages and bilingual  dictionaries. Also used are teacher-made materials as well as manipulatives, computer software and graphic organizers. All  Self-contained classrooms have Smart Boards which enhance lessons and make content area subjects more engaging. All  classrooms are equipped with a laptop cart used by students and which assists with instructional practices.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently there is no TBE or DL program at P35M. All instruction in the ENL program is delivered in English however, for those  students mandated for bilingual instruction, an alternate placement paraprofessional who speaks the child's native language  and English provides native language support when needed.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     P35M provides age appropriate materials for all our ELLs students which can be found throughout all classrooms as well as  related service offices, computer labs and recreational areas.  Students at the elementary level receive instruction and  required services that correspond to appropriate grade level Common Core learning Standards and individual students' needs.  Additionally, students at the secondary level receive instruction and required services that correspond to appropriate grade  level Common Core Learning standards and individual students' needs. When necessary, materials and instruction are adapted  to meet the needs of the students and to ensure that all instructional materials are fully accessible for all students.  Instruction  that students receive are aligned with Common Core learning standards.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Currently P35M does not share a building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All newly enrolled students, along with their parents or guardians are given a tour of our school's program. It familiarizes them  with the culture and expectations of our school as well as the resources available to them. The parent coordinator or an  administrator on site gives the tour. Should translators/interpreters be needed, they will be provided by the school.  Additionally, parents of newly enrolled students are invited to attend a parent informational meeting at the beginning of each  school year. Translators/interpreters are provided if needed. Our school parent coordinator and family-worker collaborate  closely with families of newly enrolled students as well as throughout the year to ensure a smooth transition for both the  students and their families. Also, prospective students are invited to attend Chapter 683 summer program.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered as an elective at P35M.       18.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  P35M holds weekly workshops on Wednesdays from 1:30 until 2:50. Staff members are often divided into cohorts and content  area team groups. all staff members are required to attend, they will include our ENL teacher, classroom teachers, cluster  teachers, guidance counselors, psychologists, speech therapist, and our administrators. Our ENL teacher will attend  professional development instructional workshops throughout the school year and turnkey the information and resources  gathered to other staff members at P35M who work with ELLs. The school-based coach will provide support through  mentoring teachers in designing and developing  standards-based lessons and assessments as well as engaging students in the  CCLS.  All teachers at P35M attend a variety of workshops done by the NYC DOE as well as Professional Development offered by  District 75 on a regular basis in order to keep up with the requirements as per CR Part 154. 2.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our elementary and middle school students are at Bellevue Hospital school and get the support they need from hospital staff  members who are trained to help them. Teachers on site meet the needs of those students and our ENL teacher makes sure  their requirements as per CR Part 154.1-2 are met.   Every Monday P35M has in house Professional Development workshops from 2:30 until 3:50 PM.  A variety of topics are  offered during those workshops addressing issues within  Cohorts such as supporting struggling students and what is our  school plan to implement that support,  also addressing cohort specific issues.

Once a month our school offers a workshop which topic only revolves  around ELLs needs as well as ELLs State regulations. Attendance is mandatory for all staff. It is very important for P35M to  make sure all staff members are aware of the Policies New York State as well as New York City involving ELLs. Our once a  month workshop is given either by our ENL teacher with our school coach or an outside staff members sent by the district  office.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Incoming ELL's parents are invited/mandated to attend the Language Proficiency Team meeting (LPT) to discuss the eligibility  of the child's English language development. Also, informal meetings throughout the year can be schedules for ELL's parents in  order to inform them of the progress and/or changes recommended  for the child as well as discussing NYSESLAT results for  the incoming school year. All meetings with ELLs' parents/guardian not only include our ENL teacher but content are teachers  as well. Should translation be needed, the school will provide a translator during the course of the entire meeting.  A log is  kept at the school with our ENL teacher of all meetings taking place during the school year as well as a record of all phone calls  made home to informed and invite our ELL's parents to our school. Additionally letters are sent home via our school secretary  with return receipt.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our parent coordinator with our ELL teacher invite our ELLs parents/guardian to come and tour our school in their native  language with the help of a in-house translator. A small breakfast is then offered to the families with a Q&A at the end. School  parties with parents are also a good way to include our ELLs' family members. also, workshops are offered to parents in their  native languages as well as parents trainings. Informative literature is given to parents in their native languages. In school  translation services are available in Chinese and Spanish. If the parents speak a language other than our in school translation  team speaks, a Language Identification Guide chart will be shown to the parents so that we can identify which language they  speak and need help with. Then a Translation unit is called.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P35M                                                                              School DBN: 75M035  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Notices are posted at the front door of our main office describing the translation/interpretation services we  provide. Also, Home Language Identification survey and ATS reports are used to find out the home language of all  our ELLs in our school. Parents indicate on our emergency contact blue cards their preferred language when  contacting them at home. From the ATS reports and survey information, we are able to learn with certainty when  translation and interpretation needs are required. Bilingual staff assist in translation and interpretation of needs  and all translated documents are generated from NYS-DOE translation services.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Language    Written  Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    1   5   1   1               0   245   46   1               0.33   1.66   0.33   0.   0   81.4   15.28   0.33   1   3   1   1               0   244   47   1               0.33   0.33   0.33   0.33   0   81.06   15.61   0.33                           Armenian   Chinese   Fulani   Japanese   Mandarin   English   Spanish   Urdu              3.

A sign for translation and interpretation services in the appropriate languages has been posted near the main office  entrance. Our staff who are bilingual provide translation when needed. The Parents' Guide to Language Access in DOE  translated languages is available in our school main office. We also use the DOE over the phone interpretation  services, also, a language identification guide is at the parents disposal at the security desk as well as in the main  office. This is so that non-English speaking parents may find their language, the main office will be contacted and a  bilingual staff member will be contacted for translation.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent surveys are sent home. It allows our ELLs parents to rate the services they have received during the school year  and to have input on our programs for our ENL students. The data allows our school to make changes in our program  planning and services for our ELLs students if necessary.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64
