This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our Mission is to develop a community of learners who are prepared for college and career who are able to think  critically and adapt to a rapidly changing society. Our school’s vision is aligned to the District 9 vision; pupil centered  and content which are responsive and rigorous, interactive, diverse and engaging (P.R.I.D.E.) vision. This can only be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      acquired by equipping our staff with the tools to provide a rigorous student centered approach to teaching and  learning, culturally responsive training and implementation of social emotional strategies for our diverse students.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 35X was founded in 1901 as The Franz Sigel School and is located in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. We have  a population of 621 children in grades kindergarten through fifth grade. Students are from the local community, and  from diverse countries, including Mexico, Central America, Asia, Africa, and several islands in the Caribbean. Our  school is a central part of the community to the students and their families.   P.S. 35X has been a school in good standing for more than 21 years. There are significant factors that are attributed to  this success. A strong instructional leadership team, a stable staff with many years of experience who can mentor the  new incoming staff, a nurturing school environment, operational systems and structures, a strong academia, thriving  performing arts programs, and a budget that supports these structures. P.S35X has 30 classes, 4 are 12:1:1 , 2 are  12:1, 8 are ICT and 16 general education classes with some students receiving speech and other related services in  these classes.    One of our major challenges is constantly adapting to growing classroom registers and the lack of space in a building  over 118 years old. Our school does not have a gymnasium but is part of the PE Works initiative which provides a  certified physical education teacher. Another critical challenge is implementing the Next Generation Standards and  the Every Student Succeeds Act requirements(ESSA) to meet the academic needs of English Language Learners (ELLs)  and students with disabilities (SWDs).    The 2018-2019 Comprehensive Education Goals were developed collaboratively with the School Leadership Team,  teachers, paraprofessionals and the Administrative cabinet. Each goal was developed as a result of an in-depth  analysis of the 2017-2018 end of year data as well as a needs assessment that was conducted in the beginning of the  2018-2019 school year. Each goal is aligned to the district and schools vision and mission statement as well as the  Next Generation Standards, ESSA requirements, Capacity Framework and the Chancellor's Priorities (Accelerate  Learning and Instruction, Partner with Communities, Develop People and Advance Equity Now).   In 2018-2019 our goals and instructional focus will be on improving rigorous instruction through effective assessment  practices. Collecting and analyzing data specifically focusing on 3d of the Danielson Framework for Teaching and  Learning and concurrently working on indicator 1.2 Pedagogy and 2.2 Assessment form the Quality Review.     Our curriculum in all content areas will be centered on the use of small group stations from grades K-5 to provide  access to all students including English Language Learners and students with disabilities at their level and to  accelerate academic progress. We will continue to work on the foundation we established in restructuring the special  education department. In addition, the focus for our special education staff will be continue to use Specially Designed  Instruction (SDI) for students with IEP's. SDI refers to the specific teaching strategies and methods used by teachers to  instruct students with learning disabilities and other types of learning disorders. Our special education students will  continue to be supported by the New England Center for Children (NECC). NECC is a non-profit autism research and  education center dedicated to transform the lives of children with autism worldwide through education, research,  and technology. Our partnership with NECC will continue to provide a support system for our school community  which includes our staff, students and families. We will continue to conduct monthly meetings with a behavior  specialist to share strategies with teachers, paraprofessionals, and families.    For the 2018 school year our school applied and was approved to participate in the Learning Partners program. The  Learning Partners Program (LPP) is designed to promote inter-school collaborative learning and leverage the rich  reservoir of expertise that already resides within our school communities to improve the educational experience for  all New York City students. Using the Framework for Great Schools as a focal lens, the Learning Partners Program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      matches a host school that exhibits strong practices in a specific learning focus area with two or more partner schools  that are interested in strengthening their own practices in that area. Our focus area in the Learning Partners program  will be assessment and we are partnered with P.S.49X and P.S. 277X.    As part of our endeavours to grow leaders from our school one of our coaches applied and was selected to participate  in the Leadership in Education Apprenticeship Program(LEAP). This program is for experienced teacher leaders who  want to become assistant principals and eventually principals. Through this program the LEAP candidate will be  mentored by the school Principal and receive extensive administrative and supervisory experience.    Our school will also participate in the Computer Science for All initiative. Two of our teachers were trained in the  summer of 2018 and will implement the critical components of CS4all. Students in their classrooms will learn to think  with the computer, instead of using computers to simply convey their thinking. Students will learn computational  thinking, problem-solving, creativity and critical thinking. They will also learn to collaborate and build relationships  with peers, communicate and create with technologies, and to better understand technologies we interact with daily.    P.S. 35X presently has: one principal, one assistant principal, two secretaries, five coaches (1 special education, 3  literacy, 1 mathematics), 54 classroom teachers, eight clusters, five English as a New Language (ENL) service providers,  one SETSS provider, four speech teachers, one IEP teacher/SAVE room teacher, two social workers, 16  paraprofessionals, a parent coordinator, a nurse, six school aides, one safety officer, lunch room staff, and School  Based Support Team (SBST) members. Of the pedagogical staff, 95.6% are fully licensed and certified and 75% have  more than 5 years teaching experience in the school.    Our after school academic programs will service all students including ENLs and SWDs in small groups. Morning  program from 7:30am-8:20am for grades 3, 4 and 5, provides academic support for these students. Saturday  Academy: November 2018 thru April 2019, provides support in English Language Arts and Mathematics for all  students.   Our clubs are performing arts and sports driven. They expand learning opportunities that support developmentally  appropriate cognitive, social, emotional, and physical outcomes. In addition, these programs offer a balanced  academic support in the arts and cultural enrichment.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Currently, we have 621 students. Of these 27% are English as a New Language students and 23% are students with  disabilities. This requires strategic implementation of indicator 1.2 on the Quality Review (Developing teacher  pedagogy form a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and  Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all  students produce meaningful work products). For the 2108-2019 school year we will add a Kindergarten 12:1:1 self  contained class due to the high number of turning five students coming to our school. In total we will have six self  contained classes and eight Integrated Collaborative Classes. In addition, we have 137 students receiving speech and  language, 54 receiving occupational therapy, 1`5 receiving physical therapy. With the high number of students  receiving speech services one of our priorities will be learning about the types of processing students are struggling  with , specific strategies to help them with the lack of processing abilities and working memory which are crucial to  learning. As a school we are also making a concerted effort to learn more about the relationship between the brain,  how students with disabilities think and interventions designed to bridge learning gaps. The neuropsychology of  mathematics, reading and writing and the work of Steven G.Feifer, D.Ed and Douglas A. Fina, PhD will be our initial  foundation for this work. Our work in this area and focus on assessment practices, analysis and interventions will  reduce the number of students with IEP's and define specific structures and strategies for our struggling students.    Another student population that is our focus are our English as a New Language students (ENL). For the 2018-201`9  school year we have 27% of students who are English as a New Language students. Our ENL students make progress  from entering, emerging and transitional but hold steady in the expanding progression. In order to address this need  we will analyze the NYSESLAT data and the components tested to ascertain how we can move more students into the  commanding level. To this end our ENL teachers will attend professional development sessions where the main focus  will be instructional strategies to address the needs of the ENLs. Our assessment focus this year will include ongoing  analysis of the work in ENL classes to work on strategies that promote positive outcomes for our ELL students.                     4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school made the most progress in Trust and Collaborative Teachers measure over the past year. The schools key  areas of focus will be on creating rigorous instructional tasks in all content areas by improving teacher pedagogy  through our focus on assessment practices.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X035   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   661   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        A collaborative approach was implemented in analyzing school data. The community involved include but are not  limited to, the Principal, Assistant Principals, Teachers, Paraprofessionals, School Psychologist, School Leadership  team, Parent liaison and the United Federation of Teachers Union Representative. The aforementioned individuals  were asked to review the schools vision and mission statements as well as the instructional focus for the 2018-2019  school year. Additionally, the academic policy, performance and assessment lead from the Bronx Field Support Center  was asked to review the school’s data from the Instructional Reports and met with administration to give feedback  and look at specific standards that demonstrated growth and standards that should be a focus in teaching and  learning.      The last Quality Review for our school took place in 2016-2017. The area of focus in our quality review was 1.2  pedagogy with a "Proficient" score. The area of celebration was Teacher Teams and Leadership Development with a  rating of "Well Developed", The strength of our teacher teams will help our school community implement our  instructional focus.    The results of the 2017-2018 New York State assessments in English Language Arts and Mathematics demonstrate the  following; In English Language Arts 25.6 percent of students scored at levels 3 and 4 from 25 percent in 2016-2017.  Disaggregated data demonstrates a decrease in level 1 for students with disabilities and English Language Learners  and an increase in level 2 for these students as well. In Mathematics 21 percents of students scored at levels 3 and 4  percent an increase of 5% from 16 percent in 2016-2017. Disaggregated data demonstrates a significant reduction of  students in level 1 in mathematics and an increase of students in level 2.    The School Quality Dashboard demonstrates that 95% of our former 5th grade students are above the average in the  Middle School Course Pass Rates. This indicates that our teachers and staff have prepared our students well so that  they are able to transfer learning and succeed at the next level.      P.S. 35X will continue to participate in the District 9 iReady initiative. The school will administer the diagnostic exams  during identified periods in the academic year. IReady will be used as a diagnostic for reading and mathematics that  identifies students' needs and tracks their achievement towards end of year targets. IReady will be used 45 minutes  each week for literacy and mathematics to support student progress. Students will learn to track their learning and  develop skills toward college and career readiness. The iReady data will be used to refine curricula, instructional  practices and to align resources for all students. Data will be shared with staff to inform the work of teacher teams,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      curriculum/lesson adjustments and for individualized or group differentiated instruction. It will be shared with  students and families to support the development of skills towards college and career readiness. In mathematics, we  will continue to implement the Five Practices for Orchestrating Mathematical Discussions and the Math Daily 3. The  Five Practices are structures which focus on students struggling and learning through problem solving while the  teacher monitors and guides the learning. These practices are part of a well designed structure and can be  implemented with any math curriculum. The Math Daily 3 is a framework for structuring math time so students  develop deep conceptual understanding and mathematical proficiency while leading to independence.    Our assessment focus leads us to implement a research based school improvement plan that will result in positive  student outcomes. The 2017-2018 New York State data in English Language Arts and Mathematics, current school  baselines such as iReady in English Language Arts and Mathematics, Fundations, Fountas and Pinnel results, writing  baselines and Science and Social Studies beginning of year assessments will be used to evaluate, analyze and  implement the plan. Staff will gather and organize data, review current performance, describe performance trends,  prioritize performance concerns, identify root causes, identify solutions and action steps, identify implementation  evidence, set performance targets and identify measurable objectives. In addition a strategic and structured Response  to Intervention plan will be implemented to address the gaps in literacy and mathematics. The thoughtful data  analysis, careful problem framing, and ongoing monitoring of gaps between goal achievement and current conditions  will lead our school to positive learning outcomes.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, the number of students who are at levels 3 or 4 will increase by 10% in grades 3-5 in both literacy and  mathematics through the use of multiple rigorous instructional approaches and targeted intervention as evidenced in  the New York State assessments.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  DATA SOURCES:   The School Quality Guide 2017-2018 Framework Element scores show an increase from 2.84 in 2016-2017 to 3.30 in  2017-2018. The Survey Element Scores demonstrate an increase from 2.14 in 2016-2017 to 2.91 in 2017-2018.    School wide positive behavior expectations plan will continue to be implemented in our school. In addition, a morning  social emotional meeting with a specific monthly theme will be implemented daily. This will allow for a check in with  students who may present challenges for the day. The teacher can address these or get support from other school  staff such as guidance counselor or social worker if needed. Our "Caught Being Good" school wide program will  continue with students getting coins when they are caught being good and earning points towards school rewards  such as extra recess, a special movie and the grand finale Carnival for those with the most points.    Teachers will develop their own plan and include the school wide behavior expectations. To support this plan, the  school will create a culturally responsive environment where all students and families feel valued for who they are  and where they come from. Their stories are vital to the relationships with all of the school community. All staff will  receive training in understanding what culturally responsive education looks like and implement it in their classroom  and our school community.    For students with special needs the behavior management approach used by the New England Center for Children will  be implemented. NECC is a non-profit autism research and education center at the forefront of conducting and  publishing research to further the understanding and treatment of autism and related disabilities. It has developed  techniques to help de-escalate and maintain safety in volatile situations. While NECC primarily works with autistic  students and students with extremely challenging behavior the preventive techniques are appropriate for all  students. Known as CALM, the set of procedures is designed to safely prevent physical altercations or de-escalate  physical confrontation. CALM was specifically developed for professionals working with children with autism and is  intended to be used with children five years of age and older. This approach is general to teaching, rather than a  program designed to address a specific school issue. It is based on the premise that children learn best when they  have both academic and social-emotional skills. The NECC approach consists of a set of practices that build academic  and social-emotional competencies and that can be used along with many other programs. Knowing the children we  teach- individually, culturally, and developmentally- is as important as knowing the content we teach. How we, the  adults in the school, work together is as important as our individual competence: Lasting change begins with the adult  community (2007, Northeast Foundation for Children, Inc.) This program also aligns with the current Domains and  components required to be implemented for 2018-2019 in the Danielson Framework for Teaching (Domain 2a  Classroom Environment: Creating an environment of respect and rapport, 2d Managing student behavior and 3c  Engaging students in learning, 4e Growing and developing professionally).   The approach and school based social emotional components that will be incorporated throughout the school include:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21      ● Daily Meeting —gathering as a whole class each morning to greet one another, share news, and warm up for the  day ahead. There will be a structured plan for morning meetings and monthly themes. These themes include; Respect,  friendship, self discipline, kindness, integrity, responsibility, honesty, courage, tolerance and compassion.    ● Behavior Guidelines —helping students create classroom rules to ensure an environment that allows all class  members to meet their learning goals   ● Interactive Modeling —teaching children to notice and internalize expected behaviors through a unique modeling  technique   ● Positive Teacher Language —using words and tone as a tool to promote children's active learning, sense of  community, and self-discipline   ● Logical Consequences —responding to misbehavior in a way that allows children to fix and learn from their mistakes  while preserving their dignity   ● Academic Choice— increasing student learning by allowing students teacher-structured choices in their work   ● Classroom Organization— setting up the physical room in ways that encourage students’ independence,  cooperation, and productivity   ● Working with Families —creating avenues for hearing parents' insights and enaging in interactive and collaborative  activities.   ● Collaborative Problem Solving —using conferencing, role playing, and other strategies to resolve problems with  students   In addition, the NECC a certified behavior consultant will work with specific staff experiencing extreme challenges  with students in the following areas:    Development of behavior guidelines, development of crisis plan, De-escalation training both verbal and physical and  on site modeling of techniques. The NECC behavior specialist will also work with teachers on addressing the behaviors  of a few students who repeatedly display inappropriate responses which may lead to physical interactions. The school  will have a SAVE room with a trained special education teacher who will work closely with the NECC behavior  specialist and students to teach them self-regulation skills. The New England Center for Children behavior consultant  will support the SAVE room teacher. All of these practices will provide support that will build school capacity to  address severe behavioral issues .    The NECC approach will be evaluated in January and June with classroom data and modifications will be made if  necessary.    The school has been selected to participate in the "Bridging The Gap" program. This program gives the school an  additional social worker assigned to work with families and students in temporary housing. The social worker will  create a comprehensive plan to address the educational and social needs of students in temporary housing.

DATA SOURCES: Framework for Great schools/School Quality Guide 2017-2018 Quality Review 2016-2017      The Framework for Great Schools/School Quality Guide demonstrate the following:   Cultural Awareness and Inclusive Classroom Instruction 4.00    Quality of Professional Development 3.33    School Commitment 3.17    Innovation and Collective Responsibility 3.00    Peer Collaboration 1.25    Quality Review    How well do teachers work with each other? (4.2) Well Developed 4.99      Our last quality review reported that the vast majority of teachers are engaged in inquiry-based, structured  professional collaborations. Distributed leadership structures are embedded. Teacher instructional capacity has  strengthened while promoting the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards and instructional shifts.  Distributed leadership structures have played an integral role in focusing on the instructional goals as well as the  design and delivery of school wide coherence building to support student learning across the school. Inquiry teams  regularly meet with specific protocols in place. The school has embedded distributed leadership structures with three  English Language Arts (ELA) coaches, one math coach, and one special education coach that support teachers by  providing daily instructional support and conduct professional development to build teacher capacity. The assistant  principal and coaches support teachers through modeling, inter-visitations, coaching sessions, and after school  support sessions. All coaches have identified specific cohorts of teachers based on strategic priority of experience and  observable needs for teachers. The coaches support new teachers with a focus on classroom routines and  management; unpacking units in all connect areas, as well as implementing baseline assessments and the analysis of  the assessments to inform instruction. The special education coach works with new Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) and  self contained special education teachers to build their skill sets as special education teachers and supports teachers  implementing behavior management strategies with students. For the 2018-2019 school year teachers will have class  and individualized goals linked to the school wide instructional focus on assessment. Teacher goals will be evaluated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28      by administration through classroom support visits, observations, informal feedback, and analysis of student work  products in inquiry teams and by administration.    The school survey data demonstrates high scores in important areas that promote academic achievement. However,  there is work to be done in peer collaboration. Specifically, teachers say that at the school teachers would like to  make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade levels This work will be done  through the collaborative teacher teams. Coaches and administrators will work on promoting innovative approaches  in collaboration through Inquiry teams.   For the school year 2018-2019 we will have two new teachers in addition to nineteen teachers with less than four  years experience. Our instructional focus on assessment practices will be a priority for planning and preparation  (1a,1e) as this is critical to supporting new teachers. The professional development committee will prioritize the  alignment of assessment practices with planning and preparation for all teachers and in particular for teachers with  four years or less. Coaches will give support in these areas and help teachers learn effective practices to apply in the  implementation of the instructional focus. We hope that the support will help retain these new teachers and set them  on the path to becoming effective educators. Most importantly, research shows that new teachers who received  intensive mentoring had a significant effect on student achievement after as little as two years (Strong, Fletcher, &  Villar, 2004; Serpell & Bozeman, 1999).   Our school will continue to participate in Teacher Rounds using the structures of Harvard Teacher rounds learned in  2017-2018. The rounds will focus on the use assessment practices to inform instruction. The teachers leading the  Teacher Rounds will work on a problem of practice with specific structures and conduct non-evaluative observations  to give teachers feedback and improve their instructional practice.   For the 2018 thru 2021 our school will start a journey in the Learning Partners Program. We are partnered with two  Bronx schools, P.S.49X and P.S. 277X to share strong practices. Our schools have selected to work on assessment  practices and will collaborate in professional development, inter-visitations and cycles of inquiry on the selected  practice..   Additional systemic structures that support professional collaboration are the following:   · Daily scheduled time for grade or department meetings in the prep schedule   Disciplined Inquiry teacher team meetings during scheduled school on Monday’s Professional development time.   · MOSL Committee meetings   · After School Grade/ Content Planning Sessions   · Special Education Department meetings   · Lunch and Learn Grade or Department Meetings   · Content Sessions   UFT Consultation meetings            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          29           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   DATA SOURCES: The Framework for Great Schools Report; School Quality Guide 2017-2018      The Framework for Great Schools report shows that Parent-Principal Trust was 4.00 , Teacher–Principal trust received  a score of 4.00, Teacher Parent Trust at 3.80 and Teacher-Teacher Trust at 3.00. Inclusive Leadership scored at 4.00  and the areas needed to be improved were accomplished as they were all above 3.00 from the 2.00 scores of the  previous year. Although the majority of the Effective School Leadership areas were above 3.00, program coherence  was 2.33. Specifically only 67% teachers say that curriculum, instruction, and learning materials are well coordinated  across different grade levels at their school. Therefore, planning and preparation(1a,1e) both by grades and vertically  will lead to program coherence. This work will be supported by the administrative and instructional team.    The administrative and instructional team is comprised of the Principal, an assistant principals, five coaches and one  IEP teacher. For the 2018-2019 school year the assistant principal will supervise the mathematics and science  department in general education and special education department including ICT classes and self-contained classes.  The principal will supervise all grades but will focus on grades K-5 English Language Arts department and assessment  practices in all grades. There are five coaches; one special education coach, three literacy coaches and one math  coach. One of the coaches is centrally funded and part of the Universal Literacy initiative. Coaches assignments have  been divided in cohorts with priority given to new teachers. They will observe and meet at least once per week with  teachers to support their pedagogy and conduct formal/informal visits. The discussions are focused around effective  instructional practices. They will support teachers in becoming effective or highly effective in their practice.    The coaches will create and design innovative ways to promote literacy and mathematics achievement throughout  the year. They will work on developing trust and collaborating with teachers. Coaches will provide model lessons, help  unpack programs and standards, co-teach and work side by side with teachers.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, the unpacking of standards, sharing effective practices and engaging in rigorous tasks will result in the  program coherence score to increase by 8 points as evidenced in the Framework for Great Schools Report/School  Quality Guide for 2018-2019.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

The School Quality Guide demonstrate the an increase in the Framework Element scores from 2.44 to 3.19 and a  decrease in the Survey Element scores from 3.47 to 3.21.    The School Leadership Team met and comprised a list of engaging activities for parents. The School Leadership Team  would assist in securing the resources for the implementation of these activities. These activities include training on  nutrition, CPR, basic literacy, family game nights, stress, cultural festival, financial awareness, emergency  preparedness and parent support groups. It also includes increasing the number of parents who complete the school  surveys by providing the time, space and guidance at the school.    The school will work on creating a website to promote the positive activities, events and learning opportunities for  parents.    Our school will use Epstein’s Framework on Involvement. This framework uses six components that assist schools in  increasing parental involvement (Taken from NEA Policy Brief).   ● Parenting: Assist families with parenting skills, family support, understanding child and adolescent development,  and setting home conditions to support learning at each age and grade level. Assist schools in understanding families’  backgrounds, cultures, and goals for children.   ● Communicating: Communicate with families about school programs and student progress. Create two-way  communication channels between school and home that are effective and reliable.   ● Volunteering: Make public opportunities to volunteer in the school. Improve recruitment and training to involve  families as volunteers and as audiences at the school or in other locations. Enable educators to work with volunteers  who support students and the school. Provide meaningful work and flexible scheduling.   ● Learning at Home: Involve families with their children in academic learning at home, including homework, goal  setting, and other curriculum-related activities.   ● Decision Making : Include families as participants in school decisions, governance, and advocacy activities through  school councils or improvement teams, committees, and other organizations.   ● Collaborating with the Community: Coordinate resources and services for families, students, and the school with  community groups, including businesses, agencies, cultural and civic organizations, and colleges or universities .   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      During the 2018-2019 school year, we will make a strong pledge to help parents become active stakeholders in our  school. Thus, the school will create time and space for parents to engage in interactive activities. Some of these  include understanding of the performance standards, assessments, student progress. Curriculum Nights (Literacy,  Math, Science, etc.) or by scheduling a conference with their child’s teacher and/or a member of the administrative  team. During said meetings, materials, training and Common Core Curriculum resources will be available to parents.  Parents will also participate in club activities collaboratively with our school staff to get to know each other better in  an informal environment.    We know that parents are one of the most important stakeholders in our school community. Therefore, teacher grade  teams are going to conduct interactive and engaging workshops teaching parents how to implement instructional  strategies that will help their children make progress. These meetings will be a part of our commitment to help  parents become more involved in the learning and academic growth of their child/children.    In addition, the administration team will provide each teacher with a parent log for each child within the classroom  that will be sent home monthly. These logs create two-way communication between school and home. Teachers and  parents will have consistent opportunities to have recorded communication that includes questions, concerns and/or  comments that could be referred to later, if needed.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Parents are  given the opportunity to attend an open house to get an insight into the everyday happenings of the school. They visit  the Kindergarten classrooms to learn the structure of the classrooms and observe the instructional practices.   Pre-school students visit our school and engage in at least one activity.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The instructional focus and the school improvement plan focus on assessment. The research based steps to evaluate  current data, analyze it and implement changes will be used with our school community. Administrators and coaches  will continue to meet with teachers to analyze current program assessments and modify if necessary. Assessments  are presented to teachers for review and analysis. In some cases, they are modified to meet the needs of the students  in each class. The item analysis tool for grades 3-5 will be used to analyze patterns and trends, correlate with baseline  assessments to inform instruction and create intervention groups. The MOSL committee makes decisions  collaboratively on state and local measures. Professional development will be provided on the use fo data to inform  instruction, formative assessments and assessments throughout the lesson. Teachers meet during common  preparation periods to review curriculum assessments and discuss topics of interest for future professional  development sessions.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS35X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act;   ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● Supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The data over the most two most recent consecutive years showed many variations in students'  progress. ENL students in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5 showed some growth in proficiency levels. Of the  185 total ENL students in grades K to 5, 11 students scored at the commanding level and 62  students maintained the same proficiency level although there were some areas of slight  increases in the points/score.  In addition, 30 students went up one proficiency level, 6 students  went up two proficiency levels, and 11 students regressed one proficiency level from the  previous year. Stronger emphasis will be placed on writing across all content areas, building  academic vocabulary, and academic discourse.     (The results on the 2017 NYSESLAT signify that students can benefit from a substantial amount  of support in writing with additional support in reading. Students scored high in the writing  modality in grades 1 and 3. Students in grades 4 and 5 will receive more support in writing.  Speaking will also be given additional support.  Students will show growth in reading and  writing as they engage in discourse via multiple instructional settings.) (Modifications will be  made pending the 2018 NYSESLAT results.)    (The preliminary NYS assessment results for our English language learners in grade 3, 4, and 5  showed that more students met the criteria for ELA than for mathematics. This creates the  urgency to support students in understanding the mathematics content vocabulary in Spanish.)    For one day each week, effective Wednesday, October 10, 2018, students in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5  will receive two hours and 15 minutes of direct instruction. ENL strategies will be implemented  to support students language acquisition. Students will receive two hours of direct instruction in  ENL strategies through mathematics, reading and writing. Thirty minutes of this session will  permit students to have independent and differentiated activity time on computers and iPads.  Students will use various applications and websites (Colorin Colorado) to build on their areas of  weakness. A total of 25 sessions will be directed by five (5) ENL/TEOSOL/Bilingual licensed  teachers and span from 2:45 pm to 5:00 pm. The service providers are comprised of four dually  certified teachers (two CB/ bilingual and two CB/ TEOSOL) and one TEOSOL.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The following literacy programs and school-based assessments will be used to assess early literacy skills of ENLs:       Teachers College Reading and Writing Program will be used for all students (ENLs included) in grades Kindergarten through  Grade 5. As a diagnostic assessment, students are administered a placement test in foundational skills and Fountas and Pinnell  running records. These assessments will be the foundation for the developmental progression for literacy skills in the areas of  phonics, fluency, comprehension, and early writing skills.       Students will complete a writing baseline assessment on a topic provided by the teacher. These written baselines will be  analyzed by teachers with a common core aligned rubric and the NYSESLAT rubrics. These rubrics will be utilized throughout  the school-year. Teachers will conduct close reading of texts (running records), skill analysis, and team talk to determine   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      students' readability. ENL teachers will also analyze students' work to determine their level of proficiency in their language  development.            2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The results of the baseline assessments will provide valid information about how well, and whether ELL students are deficient  in understanding academic vocabulary and concepts in reading. This information will result in effectual planning and  preparation for daily instruction in developing academic vocabulary in classes, Morning Intervention Program and all subject  areas. Teachers will infuse the use of role play, discussions, and visuals on computers, smart boards, and iPads.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ENL teachers will collaborate with classroom and content area teachers to modify, if necessary, the curriculum and programs,  and integrate appropriate ENL strategies that can adequately service all ENL students according to their level of proficiency.  Administration of the ELL Periodic assessment will occur once in the Fall and again in the Spring. Students will also complete  classroom assessments - Fountas and Pinnell Running Records and reading and writing assessments.     Our 2017 NYSESLAT results indicate an instructional focus on improving reading and writing skills of ENL students. Students  scored lowest in the writing modality across all grades.     All students will complete the baseline, mid-line and end-line writing assessments. Analysis of the writing tasks will be  assessed and analyzed using the Teacher's College Learning Progressions Writing Rubric - Narrative Writing, Opinion/Argument  Writing, Information Writing. Progress will be monitored and intervention will be provided individually and/or in small groups.     ENL teachers will engage students in viewing and interpreting pictures and photographs. Students will first engage in  discussion about the pictures and photographs and then independently write an interpretation.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL teachers will meet to create groups/ tiers of students and create a schedule for providing effective and adequate  service and instruction. There will be ongoing progress monitoring and analyses to determine whether students are benefiting  from the program and instruction models and implementation. Adjustments will be made as students make progress or show  improvement in language development. Academic intervention will be provided as needed to focus on students' difficulties.  An emphasis will be made on specific learning targets and language needs. Utilizing cognates and familiar concepts in the  home language will support students' language acquisition and reading comprehension development.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Additional services and support are provided to students based on, but not limited to, the following:  * Results and proficiency level on the NYSESLAT  * Years of service in the program - ENL   * English and home language literacy  * Data and recommendations from content area teachers in collaboration with the ENL teachers  * Feedback from parents/guardians  * Comparison of student's work in English and in the home language       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         (This will be revised after an analysis of the 2018 NYSESLAT results is conducted.)    A thorough analysis of the NYSESLAT demonstrate the need for differentiated instruction in writing. Some students received  low scores in the reading and writing modalities, while the majority received the lowest scores in writing. Most of these  students who require support in both content areas are developing ELLs. Of the 155 test takers, 11 students scored  commanding. Thirty students advanced one proficiency level. Six students advanced two proficiency levels. In contrast, 62  students remained at the same proficiency level and 11 students regressed one proficiency level. Students will be grouped and  provided with differentiated instruction.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The necessary adjustments to programs are made after a review and analysis of the data. Teacher teams, along with coaches  and a supervisor meet to unpack units of study in both English language arts (ELA) and Mathematics. Adjustments are made in  the instruction for ENL students with the primary consideration of the language progressions and the expectations at  each proficiency level.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction for ELLs varies according to the population of the class. Classes in grades 3, 4, and 5 are departmentalized  unlike the classes in kindergarten, first and second grades. ENL teachers often push-in to provide integrated ENL  services in ELA and/or other content areas. Integrated services vary according to the student's level of proficiency.  Integrated ENL is instruction to build language skills through the content area instruction. It is delivered by dually  certified (ENL and content area) teachers or certified ENL teachers who co-teach with a certified content area or  general education teacher (i.e., English language arts, mathematics, science, or social studies).        Stand Alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  Services are provided by certified ENL teachers. Stand alone is often done via pull-out services that are provided to  students performing at the Entering and Emerging proficiency levels on the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT. Pull-out is  often done with small groups of students. At times,      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We currently do not have a TBE program at P.S. 035X.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We currently do not have a DL program at P.S. 035X.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school assures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to students' proficiency levels on  the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT assessment.  The administration and ENL teachers meet in the beginning of the year to review   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      the NYSESLAT results in order to identify ELL students and classify them according to their proficiency levels. Plans for  differentiated instruction are discussed and arranged. The proficiency levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and  Commanding) of the students determine the amount of instructional minutes students receive each week.  The times  are adjusted according to students' results on future NYSESLAT assessments.     Students with Integrated/ Push-in ENL instruction are either serviced by dually certified teachers (ENL and a content area)  or certified ENL teachers and a content area teacher.  Students with Stand Alone / Pull-out ENL instruction are also either  serviced by dually certified teachers (ENL and a content area) or certified ENL teachers and a content area teacher.  Dually  certified ENL teachers may also provide service in different locations, away from the students' respective classrooms. ENL  teachers collaborate with the general education teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support.  Common  preparation time is given to the teachers. Students are serviced within their respective classrooms via multiple instructional  models - whole group, small group, and one-to-one. Entering and Emerging students may receive additional support via push- in or pull-out by an ENL service provider.     The ENL service providers meet to review the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and Spanish LAB data and group students according to  grade and levels of proficiency. They create a schedule for adequately servicing students with support from the classroom  teachers. ENL service providers push-in during literacy and mathematics instructional periods and work with students in small  groups. For students with no or very little understanding of English, ENL providers pull them out to apply the Stand-Alone  model. They go to different locations where they can focus and build students' English language skills. Connections are  frequently made to the content being taught in the particular subject area.     Regardless of where each student is placed, students receive services according to their proficiency levels.     Entering ELLs receive 360 minutes per week - 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ ELA.     Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes per week - 90 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ ELA, and 90 minutes of  flexibility in either Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/core content area.     Transitioning ELLs receive 180 minutes per week - 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ ELA and 90 minutes of flexibility in either  Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/core content area.     Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ ELA or other core content area per week.     Commanding ELLs receive continued services for an additional two years. They receive 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL  in ELA/ core content area, or other approved Former ELL services for two additional years.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students in the stand-alone ENL program follow the same curriculum as the monolingual students within the grade but they  will receive support with ENL strategies in all content areas. Instruction in all content areas is delivered in English while  implementing ENL strategies and methodologies such as scaffolding, mirroring, contextualization, role-playing, modeling, text  representation, visual representation, schema building, and metacognitive development within the Core Knowledge and Ready  Gen literacy programs. Carefully scaffolded lessons will provide instruction and application for specific language-acquisition  strategies and reading skills. The ENL certified teacher will plan with other content area teachers and adapt instruction using  ENL methodologies. The integrated ENL push-in teachers will collaborate with classroom teachers on students’ academic  needs and the current units of study. Stand-Alone/pull-out sessions will be given to students who are performing at the  entering and low emerging levels on the proficiency scale. Furthermore, the ENL certified teacher will assist the classroom  teacher in small group instruction. In this setting, the teacher will re-teach the lesson, if necessary, with ENL support in the  students' native language.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                Students in integrated ENL programs will receive instruction from an ENL certified teacher who will co-teach with general  education/content area teacher. The ENL teacher will push-in to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support.  Common preparation time will be granted to both teachers. Classes are departmentalized in grades 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the  ENL teacher's weekly schedule will adjust to reflect the content, time, and room for providing services.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We have no bilingual or dual language programs at P.S. 035X.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for all students. Like other students, ELLs perform at varied academic levels. Students are generally  grouped accordingly.      a. At this time there are no SIFE students at P.S. 35X. In the event a SIFE student is admitted during the school year,  arrangements will be made for the student to receive instruction in an ENL class that is most suitable to his/her current  academic level of performance. The student will be placed in the grade according the placement and registration guidelines;  but instruction at a lower academic level will be provided to scaffold the student's learning.  b. ELLs who have been in our school less than three years are performing at different academic levels. ELLs performing at the  Entering and Emerging levels receive small group guided instruction daily. Instruction is geared towards early literacy  development and English language acquisition skills . Students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels also receive small  group guided instruction in literacy development but at a more advance level.  c. ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years work in differentiated groups according to individual ability levels. Many of these students  work with English proficient students. Progress monitoring is conducted for potential long-term ELLs. At this time, we have 25  potential long-term ELLs.  d. Like ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years of service, progress monitoring is conducted for long-term ELLs to provide support necessary  until proficiency level on the NYSESLAT is attained.  Former ELLs continue to receive academic support for an additional two years from the year they attained a proficiency at the  commanding level on the NYSESLAT. Former ELLs will continue to receive two additional years of test accommodations -  extended time - time and a half - on classroom, city, and state assessments. Therefore, students who scored at the  commanding level on the NYSESLAT in 2016 will receive the second year of this ELL test accommodation in this school year -  2017-2018. Students who were at the commanding level on the 2017 NYSESLAT will receive ELL test accommodations during  the 2017-2018 academic year and again in academic year, 2018-2019. In addition, these students continue to receive 90  minutes of ENL services for two years respectively.    Academic intervention services (AIS) is provided first to low performing students and/or students at risk of academic failure. In  addition, the RTI framework is implemented prior to a determination or referral for special education services or a possible  learning disability.  An analysis and review of the baseline assessments is conducted. Teachers will use the lessons and  activities from the Fundations program and iReady to provide small group and one-to-one instruction. Students are also  assessed with DiBELS. RTI periods are allocated in our daily preparation schedule. During these respective periods, assigned  teachers will work with small groups of students either inside the classroom or in another location. Small groups will be  comprised of no more than five students.    The intervention sessions will be monitored and adjusted as students show progress in each academic area of need.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs in the self-contained classes will follow the same but modified curriculum as the monolingual classes. They receive  additional support with ENL strategies in all content areas from either a push-in or pull-out ENL service provider according to  their levels of proficiency. Instruction in all content areas is delivered in English while implementing ENL strategies and  methodologies such as scaffolding, mirroring, contextualization, role-playing, modeling, text representation, visual  representation, schema building, and metacognitive development within the Core Knowledge and Ready Gen literacy  programs. As needed, translations/ connections will be made in the students' respective native languages. Instruction will  include carefully scaffolded lessons that will provide support instruction for the application of specific language-acquisition  strategies and reading skills. The ENL certified classroom teacher will plan with other classroom teachers and adapt instruction  using ENL methodologies. The ENL teachers will collaborate with classroom teachers on students’ academic needs and current  units of study for the implementation of integrated ENL/ content instruction. There will be pull-out (stand alone) sessions for  students performing at the Entering and Emerging levels on the proficiency scale. Furthermore, the ENL certified teacher will  assist the classroom teacher in small group instruction with the ELL-SWDs. In this setting, she may re-teach the lesson with ENL  support in English and/or the students' native language.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students are placed in flexible instructional groups according to their IEP's. Classroom teachers modify their instructional  practices to accommodate the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs. In most classes, a paraprofessional supports the classroom teacher  and the push-in ENL service provider during whole group, small group, and independent instruction/ activities.       Flexible programming allows ELL-SWDs to be placed in ICT classes. Adhering to the 40/60 ratio, ELL-SWDs are placed in this less  restrictive setting to have the opportunity to work with students of varied learning groups and styles.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Academic intervention is provided for ELLs in ELA, mathematics, and science. Intervention is done in English and in Spanish as  required according to individual student's native language.  Spanish is the home language of the majority of our ELL  population. When necessary, another teacher fluent in other native languages such as French or one of the African languages,  will provide translation services.      ELLs at the Entering and Emerging levels receive 180 minutes integrated ELA instruction.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The upcoming school year requires services from more certified ENL teachers. Common planning and meeting times will be  scheduled for ENL, bilingual, and general education teachers. During this time teachers will review the ELL data and units of  study to prepare lessons, gather adequate resources and group students for differentiated instruction. Progress monitoring  will also be done so that instruction and grouping of students will be more effective.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will have a bilingual program at P.S. 035X beginning in  the 2018-2019 school year.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Like general education/ English proficient students, ELLs have equal access to all school programs. Morning Intervention  Program and after-school  programs are available to provide enrichment in academic vocabulary, literacy development, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      content in various disciplines. Students engage in learning activities in all content areas with a strong emphasis on developing  students' vocabulary that extends to real life. ELLs also will attend after-school clubs and partake in the Arts programs such as  dance, art, music, robotics, and technology. ELL students are included in our departmentalized structure in grades three, four,  and five. Students transition between classes according to the subject area. Students in grades 4 and 5 also engage in selecting  majors, such as dance, music (instrumental and voice), robotics, and computer science to prepare them for future electives in  future grades and college.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used to support ELLs include the use of iPads and laptops for reading, writing, mathematics, science  and social studies. Students listen to audio books while tracking the print on the screen. As they listen and watch, they learn  how to articulate the sounds of letters and words while seeing what the letters and words look like. The iPads are also used for  handwriting practice where students use their fingers to trace letters and then eventually transfer the writing to their  individual notebooks. Peer support is a strategy that teachers implement in the classroom. ELLs are often paired with other  students that provide language support during whole and small group instruction.     The Go Math program offers ELL students individualized support in mathematics - print, digitally in English and Spanish.  Teachers assign tasks according to students' individual academic strengths and weaknesses. Teachers also have access to the  program in lower and upper grades to provide intervention and enrichment respectively. They also utilize the activities to  bridge students' understanding of mathematical concepts. Students can also access the program at home. In this way, parents  can become familiar with the content and provide additional support.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Teachers provide home language support as instructors and interpreters to ELLs in the ENL programs. Translation and  interpretation services are also requested when there is no staff member that speaks a particular native language. Teachers  also promote peer-to-peer support in the ENL programs. Students of similar native languages are peered according to English  language proficiency levels to provide native language support to other students.  For example, ELLs have English proficient  buddies who support them during whole group and small group instruction.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required services and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. The CR-Part 154 guidelines for ELL  services and  resources are followed to support the language development of ELLs. ENL teachers create schedules that that indicate the the  days and times for each student in their respective programs - Integrated ENL and/or Stand Alone ENL. ENL teachers are  required to take daily attendance to monitor and ascertain that students' weekly mandated times are provided. Make-up  sessions are arranged for students who are absent.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Attempts will be made to invite newly enrolled ELLs in grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 to an after school instructional program that is  serviced by state certified ENL teachers. This will occur in November, 2018.    During the school year, newly enrolled ELLs are included in all programs including our departmentalized structure in grades  three, four, and five. Students transition between classes according to the subject area. Students in grades 4 and 5 also engage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         in selecting majors, such as dance, music (instrumental), music (voice), robotics, computers, and art to prepare them for future  electives in future grades and college. ELLs also engage in after-school activities in science-robotics, art, reading, writing and  mathematics.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    P.S. 035X Elementary School does not offer language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time, there is no dual language program at P.S. 35X.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ELL Services Administrator will assist in providing professional development for our pedagogical staff.  Staff will participate in professional development sessions that include, but not limited to:   1. Amended CR Part 154 Regulations - Teachers will engage in discussion and develop a better understanding of the new  regulations of CR Part 154  2. Blueprint for English Language Learners Success - Teachers will review the NYS Blueprint for English Language Learners  Success. They will create a thinking map of the eight principles that guide the Blueprint for ELLs and chart actionable steps.  3. Developing Quality Instructional Programs for ELLs - After reviewing and deepening their understanding of the amended CR  Part 154 regulations, teachers will review and reflect on the current ELL programs and make informed decisions on relevant  changes.  4. Co-Teaching: Classroom Partnerships for Student Success - Teachers will explore the elements and the different models of  co-teaching, and the effect of co-teaching on improving student outcomes.     All teachers - general education, ENL, and special education - will participate in all professional development sessions that are  done either by school, grade, or specific content areas. The Common Core Learning Standards are the basis for all sessions and  this includes our instructional focus of Writing across all Content Areas.      Other professional development sessions will be facilitated by NYC R-BERN. Some topics include:       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ELL training for all staff - general education, content, bilingual, ENL and special education teachers, paraprofessionals will  be implemented as follows:  * Book study groups and content sessions will be held after-school and during the professional development block on Mondays  * Time will be spent watching and discussing videos related to CR-Part 154 and ELL identification process  * Teachers will have the option to register and attend various off-site professional development (PD) facilitated by NYC R-BERN   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         and NYC DOE DELLSS and support centers (BFSF). Such PD sessions include ELL Essentials, Curriculum Mapping: Strategies for  Successful Implementation in ENL Programs, Collaborative Co-Teaching for English Language Learners, and ELLevating:  Effective Instruction for ELLs.    All teachers, upon return after each PD, are expected to host sessions to turnkey the information to the entire staff. Agendas  and sign-in sheets are created and maintained in an ELL PD File. Copies of the information is also distributed to the staff.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ELL parents will be fully aware of the education of their children. In addition to the mandated ELL annual one-to-one meeting  with parents, there will be frequent communication between parents and our ENL and content area teachers. Parents will be  invited to meet with teachers weekly during our Parent Engagement sessions on Tuesdays from 2:40 pm to 3:20 pm.  Parents can also schedule meetings during the teachers' preparation periods. Parents will receive guidance on interpreting and  understanding students' academic process and language development.  If necessary, translation services will be offered  by licensed pedagogues, the parent coordinator, principal, or a request to translation services will be generated. Parents will  be encouraged to meet with their child's ENL teachers during our weekly parent engagement block on Tuesdays from 2:40 pm  to 3:20 pm. Teachers will facilitate demonstration lessons in the classrooms and host sessions to share activities that can be  implemented at home.    Information sessions will also be hosted to provide clarity and understanding of the language progressions. This explanation  will be reiterated during conferences with parents to understand the language development needs of their child. A log will be  maintained of all communication with parents - telephone calls, school/ classroom visits, workshops.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our goal is to have ELL parents become more actively involved in our school. There will be frequent communication with our  Parent Coordinator Liaison, who will organize workshops and training sessions for ELL parents in community building and  language development. Workshops include, but are not limited to Cooking, Adult Literacy and ESL Classes. Parents will receive  guidance in effective ways to help their child/children at home with homework, social/emotional academic and test  preparation skills. If necessary, translation services will be offered by licensed pedagogues, the parent coordinator,  principal, or a request for translation services will be generated. Parents will be encouraged to meet with their child's ENL  teachers during our weekly parent engagement block on Tuesdays from 2:40 pm to 3:20 pm. Teachers will also facilitate  demonstration lessons in the classrooms and host sessions to share activities that can be implemented at home. Parents will  have opportunities to engage in the work that's being done in mathematics, ELA, science and social studies.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Graciela Navarro, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Franz Siegel                                                                              School DBN: 09X035  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data obtained from the Home Language Identification Survey is primarily used to assess and determine  language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication. ATS reports and  students' emergency cards are also reviewed when determining the language preferences of the parent  community.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77   Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA   NA      NA   NA   NA   NA           3.
