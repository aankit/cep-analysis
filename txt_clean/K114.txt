This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission statement   Section 4: CEP Overview      The Mission of Public School Ryder Elementary PS 114 is to create a student friendly, highly engaging and  collaborative learning environment that provides Daily Grade Level Academic Structure, Social Emotional Guidance  and Academic Supports for all students and their families. Our students will be engaged in Rigorous, Standards Based  Education. All lessons will show teacher consideration of the Academic and Social Emotional needs of all students,  designing lessons that allow all students to access the content and demonstrate their conceptual and procedural   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      understanding of content, advancing their knowledge in all content areas. We will provide a comprehensive learning  environment fostered by a school-wide culture that is defined by supportive community resources, equity and  excellence for all students. We will maximize learning and academic achievement by preventing and addressing  barriers to learning and promoting a healthy physical and healthy emotional well-being of our students.                2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Ryder Elementary School is an elementary school with 517 students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade five.  Our school population comprises 77.17% Black, 13.34% Hispanic, 4.06% White, and 1.16% Asian students. The student  body includes 15.2% English language learners and 4% Special Education students. Boys account for 52.80% of the  students enrolled and girls account for 47.19%.   We will partner with families in order to develop common ground for child development that bridges differences and  provides mutually supportive practices for the home and school. The school will use authentic assessments as a  means to support stronger communication with parents. We will engender respect for the individual student, prize  diversity and pursue a social justice agenda that includes ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to  succeed at school and are prepared to be productive members of society. The three components of the school design  that are most essential for achieving the mission of this school are teaching and learning, learning supports, school  governance and management.    The teaching and learning component will include an instructional program that is thematic and interdisciplinary and  integrated with NYS Learning Standards. Beyond traditional instructional methods, teachers will strive to differentiate  instruction, utilize multi-sensory modalities, incorporate various opportunities for active and experiential learning and  capitalize on advanced technology. Students will explore issues of importance to them through collaborative and  interdisciplinary projects that are global and rooted in the local community. The school will embrace the use of  various structures that will allow teachers to know each student well. These structures will include small student to  teacher ratios, creative scheduling, teacher looping and team teaching.    • There are six primary areas of student learning support that are woven into the fabric of our school: Classroom  focused learning supports, supports for transitions, community outreach to enhance resources, home involvement  and engagement in schooling, crisis and emergency assistance and prevention, and student and family assistance.  Such supports are developed in ways that embrace a full continuum of interventions to promote health and prevent,  address and correct barriers to student learning.   2. The entire school community contributes to the direction of the school and supports the principal's vision for  improved student outcomes as evidenced by teacher input in determining school-wide foci and the active  participation of parents as members of the school leadership team and parent-teacher association. Parents  interviewed expressed knowledge of the school's annual goals and espouse, "The school is empowering". Hence,  parents state that they work alongside teachers as dedicated volunteers and help set policy for school improvement.  The work of developing a new grading policy is a direct result of parent voice in deciding school policy related to  progress reporting. Stakeholders interviewed made favorable comments about the principal's acceptance of written  plans that express ideas and new initiatives in order to make positive change for all students.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   SPECIAL SCHOOL POPULATIONS   P.S. 114 implements action plans for all ELL subgroups, including Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE),  ELLs who have been in U.S. Schools for less than three years (Newcomers), Developing ELLs (ELLs in their 4-6th year of  service) and Long-Term ELLs (7+ years of service). All ELL students receive the mandated amount of English as a New  Language (ENL) instructional minutes as per CR Part 154-2, according to their level of ENL. Additional ENL minutes  may be implemented at the discretion of the school and according to the needs of the ELL student. Developing and  Long-Term ELLs are regularly and continually assessed to determine which interventions are appropriate to assist  them in their language development as well as their academic achievement in core content areas. All subgroups of  ELL students are referred for Response to Intervention services as needed. Content standards and curriculum are  systematically adapted to meet the challenges of all ELL subgroups. For example, Newcomer and SIFE students work  intensively on listening and speaking upon arrival into the school system in order to build a strong base of “survival  English”. For Newcomer students, the ENL teachers informally assess the students literacy levels in the native (aural  interpretation, grapheme awareness, ability to recognize simple features of language) in order to build upon any skills  newcomer students may transfer from their NL. For SIFE students, addition supports are in place to address their  social-emotional needs, as they may come to school with emotional strain (i.e. as refugees, or without many of the  necessary early skills such as reading or writing which can cause frustration in students). Our guidance counselor and  school psychologist are prepared to be a part of any specific counseling that may be necessary      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   FRAMEWORK FOR GREAT SCHOOLS   In terms of the Framework for Great Schools, ELL students and their families have benefited from strong teacher  collaboration and a supportive environment. For example, through a collaborative assessment of ENL student needs  between core content teachers, ENL teachers, school leadership and parents, P.S. 114 has provided after-school  interventions for ENL students in literacy, math, and language development. Students have been grouped and re- grouped as teachers, parents and leadership have collaborated on their needs assessments. Grade Teams have also  collaborated with ENL teachers to create specific goals for students based on both their academic and language  acquisition needs and have implemented strategies in their classrooms presented to them in collaborative sessions  with the ENL teachers.    Key areas of focus for this year, in terms of the Framework for Great Schools, include providing rigorous instruction  and building strong family-community ties. P.S. 114 aims to build upon our successes in teacher team collaboration to  ensure that we provide multiple access points to all lessons and lesson delivery that both engaging and complex from  all ELL students. We will provide more time for ELL teachers to collaborate, plan and deliver targeted, integrated  instruction. ELL teachers will work across grades to ensure content-level achievement of their ELL students. We will  also collaborate to build strong family-community ties between parents and guardians of our ELL students and our  school. We will create more opportunities for adult continued learning through parent workshops and mini-institutes  on various topics related to the achievement of their ENL children. We will also create more opportunities for families  to sure their voices on matters that relate to ENL students through use of surveys in our parent workshops. The  community will be invited to P.S. 114 to celebrate the achievements of all students, including ENL students.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 18K114   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   522   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1.) Based on the following summative and formative data sources: Teachers assessments, Exit Slips, Homework  accuracy of completion and Fountas and Pinnell assessments, during the period of January through May 2018 reading  assessment results on grades K - 2, show strong evidence that forty fifty eight to seventy percent of students on these  grades are mastering reading skills. This is an increase across grades of fifteen percent.    2.) Despite this notable gain in scores, there is strong evidence that these summative and formative assessments do  not accurately communicate student ability and/or their range of skills. When tested on grades three and four there is  a significant drop in student literacy performance levels and their math problem solving skill. Consequently, teachers  on grades three and four must spend several months introducing and reintroducing concepts and skills taught on  grade two.    Across all grades, teacher will work on vertical teams, using the 3rd grade Item Skill Analysis as a measure for skill  evaluation, unit plan and concept develop. The priority is to ensure alignment between grade level performance goals  and the 3rd grade Item skills Analysis. Questions on the Item Skills Analysis are significantly more demanding student  performance, improving the focus of unit plans, better aligning material used to develop lesson plans, ensuring that  assessment questions and assessment format are aligned to standards..    Teachers will make shifts in key standards between grades, giving emphasis to identified standards sooner rather than  later. They will also develop their lessons using cross curricular planning. This allows for lessons that have depth and  require a broader range of thinking         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Informing families about classroom routines and providing them  with specific ways they can help at home provides parents with  structured opportunities to participate in their child’s education.      Home-school communication is more effective because parents  and teachers identify the best ways (e.g., phone calls, notes, or a  home-school journal) and times they can be reached. This  minimizes the frustration both parents and teachers have when  they are not able to make contact with each other and, more  importantly, makes sure that the message gets through. Using a  variety of approaches and follow-up communications can  increase the number of parents educators reach.

Teacher's plan lessons based on individual and class trends. Units also build upon one another across genres, thus  exposing students to multiple skills and then increasing the depth of learning during subsequent units. Data from daily  exit slips and other assessments are used to differentiate instruction and create small groups for targeted instruction.    Improved alignment to the learning standards ensures that all instruction is standards-driven; with curriculum  alignment in place teachers are able to utilize data analysis of various data points such as regularly administered  benchmark ELA and Math assessments, weekly assessments, conference notes, exit slips, reading response journals,  homework, Fountas and Pinnell scores and small-group assessments. Weekly assessments are aligned utilizing  standards, language and content that mirrors the standards, language and content found on ELA and Math exams.  These practices have increased student time-on-task, engagement and performance.    2.) Our priority needs are driven by the 2017 - 2018 Item Skills Analysis Report. The report on grades 3 through 5  accurately surfaced significant gaps in our evaluation of learning goals and learning targets. Assessments on grades K  through 2 did not accurately inform teachers of student performance abilities.   The information from the ITA requires more precise alignment with math standards and literacy standards on grades  k through 2. Teachers on these grades in consultation with teachers on grades 3 through 5 will collaborative  shift/concepts standards between grades to give increasing emphasis on those standards in earlier grades. .

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 114, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 114 will support parents and families of Title I students by   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

For example, many  continually entitled students scored at expanding or commanding listening and speaking levels  on the 2016 NYSESLAT; however, many of those same students scored at beginner and  intermediate levels on the reading and writing portions of the exam. For this reason,  P.S. 114  will implement an ESL After-School Reading and Writing Academy which will focus on guided  reading and writing instruction.      Selected ESL students in grades K-5 will meet twice a week, on Wednesdays and Thursdays,  from 2:30pm to 4:30pm. Students will be chosen in cycles, according to several sets of data  including NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell and teacher-created benchmark data. Each cycle will  last four weeks, beginning the week of November 17    th     and ending the week of April 27th.  Students will be assessed at the beginning of each cycle and grouped homogeneously according  to various data points and gaps. For example, for the first four weeks of the program, students  will be grouped based on Fountas and Pinnell reading levels and skills assessed in a teacher- administered ENL benchmark assessment. After the first four weeks of the program, students  will be reassessed and re-grouped according to skills mastered or not mastered on the re- assessment.      The program will service a minimum of 50 ENL students in grades K-5 in five groups of 10- 15. The program will be implemented by two certified ENL teachers and three content-area  teachers. Students attending the program will b selected from all subgroups (Newcomers, 4-6  years, Sped ELLs, Long-Term ELLs, etc.) The ENL After-School Academy will implement  guided reading with emphasis on academic vocabulary acquisition, phonics, grammar and  sentence structure. All instruction will take place in English with some translation of English  materials as needed into home languages. Students will work on tasks that exercise all of the four  modalities of language – listening, speaking, reading and writing. Direct instruction will be  provided through flexible groupings. Each teacher will be responsible for working with their own  assigned groups, and content teachers will receive ongoing professional development from the  ELL coordinator to ensure they utilize ENL methodologies as they teach their groups.  The ENL  After-School Academy will use materials crafted by the teachers of the program, guided reading  lesson plans from ReadingA-Z.com,  and Wilson Fundations for those students who struggle  with phonics and phonemic awareness. These materials are supplemental and distinct from those  used fro daily instruction. Students will be engaged in guided reading and writing activites. Each  teacher group will contain 10-15 students, and each group will be assigned their own classroom.  All materials will be chosen and adapted to meet the needs of each homogeneous student group.

Kocahan and C, Dumitrescu and our Borough Field Support  team. Title III teachers are also chosen to attend Department of ELL trainings, conferences and  Profesisonal Development sessions. These professional development workshops will be held  throughout the school year, during professional development days, grade level meetings and  professional periods.  Topics will include Understanding the New Language Arts Progressions,  Scaffolding Curriculum for ENL Proficiency Levels, Overview of the NYSESLAT; Fountas and  Pinnel Assessment for ELLs, Guided Reading with ELLs and Teaching Math to English  Language Learners.  These topics have been chosen based on teacher surveys in which teachers  have stated topics they feel they need development in. Teachers with significant ELL classroom  populations will also be chosen to attend DELLS workshops on topics germane to their roles.  Professional Development activities will also center around reading and writing literacy  strategies and how to bridge speaking/listening and reading/writing skills. Content teachers  working in the Title III program will receive monthly professional development on ENL  methodologies and Language Acquisition theory by the ENL coordinator. All teachers in the  building will receive professional development monthly at a minimum, with further PD sessions  schedules according to answers from ongoing teacher surveys. Sessions will take place during  grade-level meetings (50 mins) and after school (60 mins). PD will be given to grade level teams  separately from the rest of the staff to ensure targeted discussions and information relevant to the  grade team is given.  These sessions will positively impact the progress of ELLs by ensuring that  all staff members are aware of the specific needs of ELLs and they they are up-to-date on new  rules and regulations regarding ELLs. The ENL coordinator will provide these PD sessions. The  coordinator will attend workshops given outside of the building by DELLS, Borough Field  Support and the R-BERN to ensure that she also receives sufficient PD. All agenda and  attendance pages for PD sessions will be kept in a professional development binder in our  Teacher Center.

Adult ESL classes are offered  during two sessions on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays; the first session runs from 9:00am  to 12:00pm and the second runs from 6:00pm to 9:00pm. Adult ESL classes were formed at P.S.  114 based on student home language data, community demographics and parent requests for  Adult ESL classes. Adult ESL classes are provided by two certified Adult ESL teachers, one for  each session. The Adult ESL Program runs for the entire school year.      Parents of ENL students and Title III students are also encouraged to attend monthly ENL  workshops at P.S. 114, on topics that pertain to the learning needs of their children. Topics  include overview of the NLAP, reading and writing with children, test strategies, the importance  of L1 literacy, free NYC programs for children and families, community resources, summer  learning activities and other various student learning and family-centered topics. Parents are  informed of these workshops through backpacked letters and flyers in the native language  and phone calls in the native language. Translation services (oral and written) are provided by  staff members in Arabic, Haitian Creole, and Spanish both before and during these events. Parent  workshops are facilitated by the certified ENL teachers on staff, E. Kocahan and C. Dumitrescu.     Parent Workshops will take place monthly, on Tuesdays, at both 8:30 am and 2:30 pm. If parents  cannot attend these times, we will make special arrangements to meet individually with them to  ensure they get the information that was given. Workshops are an hour long. There will be a total  of 9 workshops for parents of ELLs and Title III student, one every month beginning in October.  Agendas, attendance sheets and copies of invitations in preferred languages will be kept in a  binder in the ENL Coordinator's room.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   P.S. 114 currently uses Fountas and Pinnell to assess the early literacy skills of all students, including ELL students. June 2015  Fountas and Pinnell Assessments show that the majority of ELLs who have been receiving 0-3 years of service have advanced  4-9 reading levels during the 2014-2015 school year. The majority of Advanced ELLs are approaching or at grade level for the  last term of the 2014-2015 school year. Kindergarten ELLs levels spanned from pre-emergent to grade-level in June 2015.       Fountas and Pinnel reading data by grade:       Grade K:   Grade-Level Achievement (Level D or Above):     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      In June 2015, one Grade K ELL student exceeded grade level expectations, 2 students met grade-level expectations, 1 student  was approaching grade-level expectations and 8 students did not meet expectations, according to F&P grade-level reading  scale.   Progress:   In terms of progress, 2 Grade K ELL students increased by 5-7 reading levels, 3 students increased 2-4 reading levels, 3 students  increased by one level and 3 students did not make progress.      Grade 1:   Grade-Level Achievement (Level I or above):   All ELL students are reading below end-of-year grade levels in June 2015.   Progress:   During the 2014-2015 school year, one grade one ELL increased by 7 levels, 6 ELLs increased by 2-4 levels and one ELL did not  make progress on F&P grade-level reading scale.      Grade 2:   Grade-Level Achievement (Level M or above):   In June 2015, 2 grade two ELLs met grade level expectations in reading, 1 ELL was approaching grade level and 5 ELLs were  below grade level.   Progress:  During the 2014-2015 school year, 3 grade two ELLs increased 7-9 levels, 2 ELLs moved 5-6 levels, 2 ELLs moved 1-3 levels and  one ELL did not make progress.      Grade 3:   Grade-Level Achievement (Level P or above):   In June 2015, 1 grade three ELL exceeded grade-level expectations in reading, 1 ELL  met grade-level expectations, 1 ELL was  approaching grade-level expectations and 13 ELLs were below grade-level.   Progress:   During the 2014-2015 school year, 2 grade three ELLs increased 7-9 reading levels, 5 ELLs increased 2-4 levels, and two ELLs  increased 0-1 level on F&P Assessments.      Grade 4:   Grade-Level Achievement (Level S or above):   In June 2015, 1 grade four ELL met grade-level expectations in reading, 1 ELL was approaching grade-level expectations and 6  ELLs were below grade-level.   Progress:   During the 2014-2015 school year, 3 grade four ELLs increased by 9 reading levels, 4 ELLs increased by 4-6 reading levels and 1  ELL increased by 2 reading levels.      Grade 5:  Grade-Level Achievement (Level V or above):    In June 2015, all grade five ELLs were reading below grade-level expectations.   Progress:   During the school year, 4 grade five ELLs increased 6-9 reading levels, 6 ELLs increased 3-5 reading levels and 2 ELLs increased  1-2 levels.      This data reveals two things – one, the majority of ELL students are not reading at grade level benchmarks and require  intensive, targeted intervention services. Two, while students are not reading at benchmark levels, the majority of ELLs are  showing progress in reading, as evidenced by the amount of students who increased four or more levels on F&P assessments  (35 students, or 55% of total students tested in grades K-5 during June 2015.)      P.S. 114 is using this data about our students literacy skills to create programs that address student reading deficits. For   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      example, our RTI process addresses student reading deficits by targeting instruction to meet their individual needs. RTI  students reading skills are assessed through Fountas and Pinnell, and students are grouped according to their skill deficit to  work with an intervention teacher in the program that suits them best (Wilson Fundations, Great Leaps, or Guided Reading).      P.S. 114 also addresses ELL reading deficits in our ENL After-School Academy, where students are grouped and re-grouped to  work on phonics, guided reading, reading comprehension, grammar, writing and language fluency.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S. 114 evaluates its ELL programming by using Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAOs) as a guide for  measuring program success. For example, from 2008-2012, P.S. 114 did not meet AMAO 1 (students making improvement on  the NYSESLAT) but did meet AMAO 1 in 2013 and met AMAO 1 and AMAO 2 in 2014. P.S. 114 is using this information to  evaluate which programming was working well during the 2012-2014 school years in order to enhance those aspects of the  programming and re-evaluate what could have worked better for the 2015-2016 school year, and for years to come.      P.S. 114 did not meet AMAO 3 during the 2013-2014 school year. We are utilizing this information to see how large the gap  was between our student achievement and the rising AMAO 3 targets for 2013-2014 in order to close those gaps by  implementing stronger programming and more targeted instruction both in the classroom and in supplemental programs.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S. 114 utilizes data from Fountas and Pinnell literacy assessments to drive our RTI Program for ELLs. P.S. 114’s RTI process  addresses student reading deficits by targeting instruction to meet their individual needs. RTI students reading skills are  assessed and students are grouped according to their skill deficit to work with an intervention teacher in the program that  suits them best (Wilson Fundations, Great Leaps, or Guided Reading).      RTI Tiers are implemented as follows:     Tier 1: Research-based strategies utilized within the framework of our core curricula, Core Knowledge in Grades K-2 and  Expeditionary Learning in Grades 3-5.      Tier II: Students work in small groups with a teacher during 30-minute sessions, 3-5 times a week, on Guided Reading, Wilson  Fundations or Great Leaps, according to specific student needs and deficits.  Tier II cycles last for 3-6 weeks, depending upon  student response to intervention. Progress is monitored during each session. If a student is not making progress at Tier II, they  move to more intensive intervention at Tier III.       Tier III: Students work in 1:1 individualized intervention with an intervention teacher for 6-12 weeks, depending upon student  response to intervention, for 30-60 minutes a day. Progress is monitored during each session and data from session progress  monitoring is utilized to drive the student’s intervention plan. If a student is not making sufficient progress in the prescribed  timeframe, they may be referred for a special education evaluation.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Combined NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data show that more students score at the Expanding level of ENL than other levels. 30% of  students scored at the Expanding level, in comparison with 24% Entering level, 22% Emerging Level, 17% Transitioning level  and 7% Commanding level.      Stand-alone NYSESLAT data also shows Expanding level students as the majority; out of 55 students who took the NYSESLAT in  2015, 35% scored at the Expanding Level. 11% scored at the Entering level; 25% at the Emerging level, 20% at the Transitioning  level and 9% at the Commanding level.      NYSITELL Data for 2015-2016 shows that most students score at the Entering level on the NYSITELL, and that those who score  above the Entering level of English acquisition are in Kindergarten, with a few exceptions. Of the 23 students who took the  NYSITELL in September 2015, 4 students scored at the commanding level; most of those students were in Grade K with the  exception of one fifth grader who transferred from a school outside of NYC. Most students who scored at the Emerging level  were in Kindergarten, with the exception of one fourth-grade student who also transferred from a school outside of NYC. The  two students who scored at the Transitioning level are both Kindergarteners, as well as the two students who scored at the  Expanding level on the 2015 NYSITELL.       This data shows that students are progressing towards language acquisition, sice the majority come to the school as Entering  students and progress to higher levels; however, students are not reaching proficiency levels outlined by state AMAO 2  measures. 2015 AMAO 2 targets were set at 15%; P.S. 114 had 9% of students reach proficiency. We plan to address this gap  by creating a targeted after-school group specifically for our Expanding-level students in order to push them towards  proficiency on the NYSESLAT in 2016.          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The Freestanding ENL program at P.S. 114 uses a combination of integrated and stand-alone ENL models to service its  ELL students. P.S. 114 has two certified ESL Teachers, with Ms. Rosen servicing Grades K, 1, 2, and Ms. Wasilewski  servicing grades 3, 4, and 5. ELL students are grouped together in no more than two classes on each grade, and ENL  teachers co-teach with core content teachers on each grade. Integrated ENL sessions are collaboratively co-planned  as well as co-taught, utilizing the 6 models of co-teaching. ENL teachers ensure that scaffolds are in place to enhance  ELL student learning processes and optimize language acquisition as well as content instruction. Adaptation of texts,  inclusion of language objectives and use of graphic organizers, sentence frames and leveled prompts and cues ensure  that ELL students have multiple access points to the curriculum.      Stand-alone ENL sessions focus on enhancing core curriculum that students encounter in their general education  classrooms. ENL teachers focus on building background knowledge and schema, which helps students participate in  their regular classrooms. ENL teachers merge curriculum topics with language learning in order to help students  acquire English while gaining information about curriculum topics.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Classrooms in grades 3, 4, and 5 are departmentalized, where teachers across each grade are responsible for teaching  two subjects (i.e. Literacy/Social Studies or Math/Science).  ENL students in those grades travel from one classroom to  another throughout the day. ENL teachers travel with and co-teach with either ELA or content teachers as their  students travel from one class to another.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 In order to provide the mandated number of minutes in ENL, students are grouped heterogeneously in no more than  two classes on each grade, and in one class on some grades in the following structure: Grade K, all ELL students in one class; in  grade 1, all ELL students in two classes; Grade 2, all ELL students in one class; Grade 3, all ELL students in one class; Grade 4, all  ELL students in two classes and Grade 5, all ELL students in 2 classes. Class structures are subject to change year-by-year;  however, The school’s two ENL teachers co-teach with core content teachers to deliver instruction. 30 periods of ENL  instruction for each grade band (K-2 and 3-5) are divided according to student needs – teachers co-teach with content  teachers a minimum of 20 periods a week and provide stand-alone ENL for 8 periods. Students are grouped for stand-alone  and core content instruction based on proficiency level, and the ENL teachers co-teach with ELA teachers to service those  students who require integrated ENL/ELA instruction (Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students). For entering students,  180 minutes of standalone ENL are implemented and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction are implemented in the  ELA classroom. For Emerging students, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction are implemented in the ELA classroom,  90 minutes of stand alone ENL instruction are implemented and 90 minutes of integrated ENL are implemented a core content  class of choice, which is determined by student needs. Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction  in the ELA classroom and 90 minutes if standalone or integrated core-content ENL as determined by student needs. Expanding  students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in either the ELA or another core content classroom as determined by student  need, and Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in either ELA or another core content area as needed.  Student need is determined by various school-wide assessments, benchmarks, classwork and other indicators of student  progress in various content areas.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Through careful planning and collaboration with classroom teachers, the Certified ENL teachers deliver content-based  instruction to all students receiving ELL services in the areas of Math, Science, and Social Studies, as well as English Language  Arts. All content is delivered in English, with varying degrees of native language (NL) support such as access to bilingual  glossaries and multicultural libraries. The curriculum is also enhanced by the ENL teachers through class field trips to locations  that support content learning. ENL teachers provide content area support by adapting text, creating accesspoints to text  through utilization of key word strategies, creating individualized graphic organizers, and developing lessons that parallel what  content teachers teach with added scaffolds. ENl teachers create all of their own materials so as to ensure that instruction is  suited to student needs.      Strategies that help make content comprehensible to ELL students include building background knowledge to support new  content knowledge and scaffolding content learning with pictures, videos, audio components, and technology  (computers/iPads/Smart Boards). Concepts are consistently linked to students’ background knowledge to help deepen  students’ frameworks for comprehension.  ELL students also receive explicit teaching of key vocabulary and terms for content  learning. Each ENL lesson contains a key language objective for ELL students in order to focus on developing English  communicative competence in conjunction with content learning.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         In order to meet the rigorous demands of the Common Core Standards, P.S. 114 is implementing Common Core aligned  curricula – Core Knowledge and Expeditionary Learning in the areas of ELA, and Go Math! in the area of mathematics. For ELL  students to meet the demands of the new curricula, ENL teachers adapt readings, create graphic organizers, provide visuals  and multimedia, focus on language fuctions of particular tasks, and educate students on the background knowledge necessary  to access the curricula.  ENL teachers also assist content teachers in adapting homework and differentiating their instruction.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         P.S. 114 does not have bilingual programming, so all classroom instruction is conducted in English throughout the school  year. Students are provided with various levels of native language support, such as bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, native  language texts, and native language computer programs when available. Assessments are conducted in English.      If any Spanish-speaking student is newly admitted, they receive the Spanish LAB to assess their literacy skills in their native  language. Newly admitted students who have been identified as SIFE are administered the LENS in their native language, when  available.   Students taking the NY State Math and Science exams are provided the exam in their native language, when available. In the  case that a translated exam is not available, students are provided with oral translators for the State Math and Science exams.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     SIFE students.      P.S. 114 has an action plan for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE). Students will receive the mandated amount  of ENL instructional minutes as per CR Part 154-2, according to their level of ENL. Additional ENL minutes may or may not be  implemented, which will be at the discretion of the school and according to the needs of the SIFE student. Content standards  and curriculum will be adapted to meet the challenges of SIFE students. Standards may be too challenging for SIFE students, so  standards will be met with a high amount of scaffolding with ENL materials (background building, use of graphic organizers,  access to literacy-rich environments, visual aides, simplified texts, manipulatives, artifacts, etc.) The ENL teachers will provide  intensive literacy and language instruction including explicit instruction in an age-appropriate manner of the five components  of reading - phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension through guided reading. SIFE students will  also be referred for RTI services on an as-needed basis.      Since SIFE students may come to school with emotional strain (i.e. as refugees, or without many of the necessary early skills  such as reading or writing which can cause frustration in students) our guidance counselor, Ms. Shirley, and Ms. Riaz, our  school psychologist, are prepared to be a part of any specific counseling that may be necessary. We also have a number of  bilingual staff members at our school who have agreed to be a part of the supportive team for SIFE students (in the case that  they speak the same language). SIFE students will also be paired with another student (the “buddy system”). Buddy system  students will be paired from same HL groups when possible.      b.     Newcomer Students      Newcomer ELL students (students receiving ELL services for 0-3 years) will receive the mandated amount of ENL instructional  minutes as per CR Part 154-2, according to their level of ENL. Students are grouped and regrouped homo-and heterogeneously  according to task difficulty. The ENL teachers informally assess the students literacy levels in the NL (aural interpretation,  grapheme awareness, ability to recognize simple features of language) in order to build upon any skills newcomer students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      may transfer from their NL. Newcomer ELLs also receive small-group RTI instruction during the school day, working on guided  reading, reading strategies, decoding skills and strategies, or high-frequency and sight words.      Support for Newcomer students who are expected to take the ELA exam after one year in the U.S. include working on  differentiated tasks that mirror the tasks on the ELA exam, exposure to the format and nature of standardized ELA exams, and  attendance in P.S. 114’s After-School Programs and Test-Prep Programs. Parents are also invited to attend Test Preparation  Workshops at P.S. 114, which focus on helping their children reach achievement on NY state exams.     c.     Developing ELLs      Students who are receiving 4-6 years of ENL services are supported via small-group and targeted instruction in a push-in, co- teaching capacity. Students who have been receiving 4-6 years of ENL services supported using individualized instruction  tailored to the students’ weakest modalities as indicated by NYSESLAT data.  ENL teachers integrate specific ENL strategies into  push-in lessons, and offer reinforcement and education to the classroom teacher on how to best serve struggling ELL students.  ELLs also receive targeted small-group instruction during the school day, working on guided reading, reading strategies,  decoding skills and strategies, and high-frequency and sight words.      Certain at-risk ELL students are also referred for RTI intervention, and an action plan is put in place during RTI meetings  between the principal, RTI coordinator, coaches, classroom teachers, school psychologist, ENL coordinator, related service  providers, guidance counselor, and parent coordinator. The action plan is implemented and student progress is monitored by  the RTI team. Students who need additional support may move upward though the three RTI tiers and receive individualized  instruction. RTI interventions include guided reading, Great Leaps, and Wilson Fundations.      d.     Long-Term ELLs.       Students who are classified as long-term ELL are supported using individualized instruction tailored to the students’ weakest  modalities as according to NYSESLAT data. Along with the students who are receiving 4-6 years of service, all long-term ELL  students are invited to participate in the ENL After-School Program. These programs provide additional support and utilize  materials and methods that are catered to suit the academic needs and abilities of struggling students.     Like ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years, certain long-term ELL students are also referred for RTI intervention services.      e.     Former ELLs     ELL students who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT and require transitional services and support for two years after  reaching proficiency will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in a core-content area as determined by student needs.  Students will be grouped heterogeneously with current ELL students during co-teaching sessions with the ESL Teachers as  needed. ELLs who have reached proficiency are also entitled to receive testing modifications for the two years after exiting ESL  services, and will receive modifications for ENL students as per CR Part 154. Bilingual glossaries will be made available to  students in testing grades who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT for two years following exit of ESL services. Former  ELLs are also invited to P.S. 114’s ENL After-School Academy and grouped according to their specific needs.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students with special needs are supported via close communication between core content teachers, ENL teachers, IEP  teachers, guidance counselor, SETTS Teachers, paraprofessionals and the school psychologist. Together with the Certified ENL  Teachers, students’ instructional plans are discussed, reviewed, and revised when necessary. Instruction may be revised as  needed for the student and instruction is differentiated in alignment with the goals and objectives reflected on the students’  IEP. ELL-SWDs receive integrated, targeted instruction with ELL students at mixed levels of English language acquisition, with  use of methods, materials, and strategies that work to help all ELL students achieve communicative competence. When   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      necessary, materials and methods may be adjusted to meet the specific needs of ELL-SWDs. Classroom materials are  differentiated to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs at P.S. 114. Adapted texts, differentiated tasks, graphic organizers, multi-sensory  approaches, kinesthetic learning techniques, tactile and visual approaches, step-by-step instructions and visual prompts and  cues are all employed for ELL-SWDs in order to provide them multiple access points to the curriculum. Programs utilized to  target specific needs of ELL-SWDs include Wilson Fundations, Great Leaps and targeted guided reading. Native language  materials used incluse Imagine Learning program usage.            7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Classroom materials are differentiated to meet the curricular, IEP, and language needs of ELL-SWDs and provide curricular  flexibility. Adapted texts, differentiated tasks, graphic organizers, multi-sensory approaches, kinesthetic learning techniques,  tactile and visual approaches, step-by-step instructions and visual prompts and cues are all employed for ELL-SWDs in order to  provide them multiple access points to the curriculum.      Integrated Co-Teaching allows our ELL-SWDs to learn in the least restrictive environment at P.S. 114. Depending on the results  of a student's initial bilingual special education evaluation and the findings of the IEP team, students are placed into ICT or self- contained classrooms according to student needs. IEP's are then re-evaluated as needed if the ENL, content or special  educatioon teacher sees a needto reevaluate the placement.  Special education, general education and ENL co-teachers plan  together to optimize instruction for ELL-SWDs and meet the needs of both their IEP goals and their language acquisition needs.  Flexible scheduling for ELL-SWDs in self-contained classrooms allows them to achieve their IEP needs and achieve language  proficiency. Students may travel to the literacy block or math in another class, as indicated on their IEP, as well as to ENL  services, and return to their self contained classrooms for other subjects.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  P.S. 114 implements an ENL After-School Academy. Students meet twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 2:20pm to  4:30pm. The ENL After-School Academy provides targeted small-group instruction based on data from various assessments.  Students are grouped homogeneously, according to language proficiency and literacy levels to work on guided reading,  grammar, vocabulary acquisition, phonics and phonemic awareness. The ENL After-School Academy implements guided  reading with a focus on vocabulary acquisition, sentence structure and language. Students work on tasks that exercise all of  the four modalities of language –listening, speaking, reading and writing. The ENL After-School Academy uses materials crafted  by the teachers of the program, as well as Wilson Fundations for those students who struggle with phonics and phonemic  awareness.      Struggling ELLs in grades K-5 also receive RTI intervention during the regular school day. Students work with a reading  specialist three times a week and are grouped using Fountas and Pinnell literacy data. Students then work on guided reading  and receive targeted instruction in decoding, letter/sound recognition, sight word and high-frequency word recognition and  reading comprehension strategies. Some students intervention plan includes Wilson Fundations for phonics and phonemic  awareness instruction or Great Leaps to address fluency issues. Native language materials are used when available (from  Reading A-Z). Progress is logged at each session and student intervention plans are re-evaluated in 6-8 weeks from the original  date of intervention to monitor whether students are progressing at their current RTI tier. Student data is used to evaluate  effectiveness of intervention, including sound/letter assessments, fountas and pinnell reading assessment data, and  schoolwide benchmark data.      P.S. 114 also implements an in-school AIS program for math intervention. Students work with a math intervention teacher 3  times a week for 30 minute sessions in small groups of 4-5 students to meet the common core math standards. ELLs also use   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      FrontRow Math, an online math program which covers common core curricula from K-5. FrontRow uses customized content,  games and lesson sequence to specifically target individual student needs.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will continue to strengthen the reading components of our supplemental programs and also will place much stronger  emphasis on writing programs. During the 2014-2015 school year, we focused much attention on targeted reading instruction  and saw great improvements in student reading levels; however, ELLs are not demonstrating strong writing abilities or  improvements in their writing.  We will improve our programming by keeping those components which focus on reading and  creating a writing scope and sequence for our ELLs and implementing cycles within our ENL After-School program which focus  on different aspects of writing.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   P.S. 114 utilized Imagine Learning during the 2014-2015 school year for selected ELL students. We will continue to use Imagine  Learning for Entering and Emerging students, as we found that the native language support contained within was very helpful  for Newcomer ELLs. However, we will discontinue Imagine Learning for Transitioning-level ELLs and above, unless we deem it a  good supplementary program for any particular student.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  P.S. 114 implements an ENL After-School Academy, where students meet twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays, from  2:30pm to 4:20pm. The ENL After-School Academy provides targeted small-group instruction based on data from various  assessments.

P.S. 114 also implements an in-school AIS program for math intervention. Students will work with a Math intervention teacher  3 times a week for 30-minute sessions in small groups of 4-5 students to meet the common core math standards.   Parents are made aware of all programs at P.S. 114 to ensure equal access for ELLs. Our Language Access Coordinator ensures  timely translation of key documents and permission slips so parents and guardians can enroll their children in all supplemental  programs. The ENL Coordinator keeps detailed records on ELL student progress to ensure that all ELL student needs are met  and individual progress is tracked.      The school hosts an SES after-school program called CAMBA Stars; all students including ELL students are welcome to  participate in the program. P.S. 114 also has a performing arts program, and the performing arts teacher ensures that all  students, including ELL students, participate in shows, plays and musical events at the school.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  P.S. 114’s ENL team uses a variety of materials to target specific learning goals and raise student achievement. The ENL  teachers create and craft many of their own instructional materials to meet the specific needs of their students. The teachers  create charts, graphs, signs, posters, pictures, graphic organizers, videos, interactive applications, presentations and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Smartboard lessons. The ENL teachers create these various materials based on each unit’s curricular focus and on student  needs.      The ENL team also structures lessons based on suggestions from the Office of ELLs QTEL Training Series and the SIOP Model,  including consistent linkage of concepts to students’ background knowledge, use of realia, visual aides and manipulatives to  differentiate instruction. The ENL teachers may also adapt grade-level text to meet the diverse needs of their students by  enhancing the text with pictures, glossaries, or enhanced simplifications.      The ENL Teachers use a variety of programs and materials to support language acquisition, such as Pearson’s Language Central.  ENL teachers use the technology program Imagine Learning to support Entering-level ELLs. Imagine Learning offers native  language support in 13 different languages.       Some websites that the ESL teachers employ include Starfall.com, an interactive website that is phonics-intensive and  Brainpop.com, which provides curriculum support through use of videos, games and hands-on projects. Students in grades K-3  use Starfall.com along with the teacher in guided lessons, and also independently in computer-lab sessions. Both ENL teachers  utilize Brainpop.com and BrainpopJr.com for all grades in conjunction with their content-focused lessons and units.      Smartboards are used for curriculum enhancement, and the teachers create interactive lessons for use with Smartboard  technology. PowerPoint slides, teacher-created interactive books, movies and videos are also shown on the Smartboard to  enhance ENL curriculum. The ENL teachers incorporate a variety of curriculum-aligned videos and clips to provide visual  background knowledge for the lessons they collaborate on.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At P.S. 114, all content is delivered in English, with varying degrees of home language (HL) support. HL Support is incorporated  by the presence of HL literature in the classrooms, usage of Google translate, bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and thesauri and  “buddy system” support (through which students are paired with another HL speaker). Native language texts are available  from ReadingA-Z.com, and students also use Imagine Learning, a computer program that offers NL support in 13 different  languages. P.S. 114 also has a number if bilingual staff members who provide HL support to our students. These varieties of  support help students with translation, transition and language-building in both English and the HL.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   The ENL teachers at P.S. 114 create homogeneously and heterogeneously mixed groups in an age and level-appropriate  manner. For example, beginner groups may include students from different grades; however, those grades only span 2  contiguous grade levels at most. The ENL teachers are careful to use grade-appropriate resources and texts. This is ensured by  the division of responsibilities amongst the two ENL teachers. ELL-SWD's use grade-level materials in their classrooms, with  scaffolds and support built in by the ENL teachers. The ENL teachers adapt high-level text by creating access points to the text  such as imagery, key words, CLOZE summaries of difficult text utilizing key words. ENL teachers consistently use the NLAP as  support when crafting age and grade-appropriate tasks for all ELLs that they can access at their current levels of language  proficiency.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    P.S. 114’s ENL team uses a variety of materials to target specific learning goals and raise student achievement. The ENL  teachers create and craft many of their own instructional materials to meet the specific needs of their students. The teachers  create charts, graphs, signs, posters, pictures, graphic organizers, videos, interactive applications, presentations and  Smartboard lessons.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 114 ensures that newly enrolled ELL students and their families are prepared for the upcoming school year upon  registration. Parents receive information about bussing, a school supply list, and information about the school. Parents are  informed that they are welcome to tour the school and translators are made available for parents who speak languages other  than English. P.S. 114 implements an open-door policy for parents in which they are afforded access to school personnel when  needed. Our Parent Coordinator, Carol Santana, serves as the first stop for parents to have their needs addressed.      Newly enrolled ELL students are paired with a native language buddy when available. Their buddy assists them with classroom  transitions and procedures. P.S 114 also implements a student/teacher buddy system; students meet with their buddy teacher  in small groups, in an effort to give students access to more adults in the building. The buddy system aims to give students  another teacher whom they can confide in and an adult in the building they know. Newly admitted ELL students are matched  with a native language buddy teacher whenever possible.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    P.S. 114 does not offer language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our Certified ENL teachers attend Professional Development Workshops offered by our network support team, as well as the  DELLSS and the Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (R-BERN). The ENL teachers also take advantage of  development opportunities from entities outside of the NYC Department of Education (i.e. NYS TESOL’s Annual Conference).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Professional Development is administered to our staff, including all teachers, paraprofessionals and related service providers,  by our ENL Teachers. Professional Developments held throughout the school year take place during grade-level meetings and  Extended Day staff Professional Development time.

For example, if teachers indicate that they desire more  training on ELL-specific matters, special PD sessions will be created to meet teacher needs. Schoo secretaries attend DELLSS  training of ELL-specific matters for school secretaries.      Teachers of ELLs, including ENL teachers, attend professional development workshops on our common core curricula, Core  Knowledge, Expeditionary Learning and Go Math. These curricula offer modifications for ELL students, which are highlighted in  the common core workshops. The modifications offer teachers options for providing multiple access points to the curricula.     ENL teachers also attend PD sessions offered by DELLSS, Borough Support Centers, and the R-BERN on UDL, TOMs and  implementing the NLAP, which inform them on how to craft CCLS-aligned learning activites that meet ELLs needs at varying  level sof language proficiency.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  P.S. 114’s Guidance Counselor, Jessica Shirley and ELL Coordinator Rachael Wasilewski meet with parents and provide them  with step-by-step instructions needed to find and apply to middle schools. Staff translators are available upon request and  documentation is sent to the NYCDOE Office of Translation Services to be translated to parents’ native languages. The  guidance staff also utilizes NYCDOE Office of Translation phone services when needed. The guidance counselor holds meetings  with parents of students transtitioning to middle school and the ELL and Language Access Coordinators ensure that parents  have oral translators available at each meeting. Parents are provided with translated packets from the NYCDOE student  enrollment center.    Professional Development is administered to our staff by our ESL Coordinator, Literacy and Math Coaches, and out network  support team. Professional Developments held throughout the school year take place during grade-level meetings and  Extended Day staff Professional Development time. Topics include: Strategies for Working with ELLs in Math and Literacy,  Collaboratiton and Co-Teaching for Teachers of ELLs, Building Background Knowledge for ELLs, and Writing and Implementing  Lesson Language Objectives, Differentiating Homework for Diverse Learners, and Understanding the NYSESLAT.  P.S. 114’s ENL  Coordinator also ensures that staff attend ELL-related PD on SIOP and QTEL strategies.      These workshops ensure that the minimum of 15% of total hours of ELL Training for all teachers as per CR Part 154-2 is met as  well as ensure that the ENL teachers at P.S. 114 remain on the cutting edge of ELL teaching methodology. Our Certified ENL  teachers attend Professional Development Workshops offered by our network support team, as well as the NYCDOE  Department of English Language Learners and the Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (R-BERN). The ENL teachers  also take advantage of development opportunities from entities outside of the NYC Department of Education (i.e. NYS TESOL’s  Annual Conference). These PD offerings ensure that the required 50% of total hours of PD for ENL teachers is met.

Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers will provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at the beginning of every school year, throughout  the month of September.  At these meetings, we will review the student’s NYSESLAT results from May, Fontas and Pinnell  results, ELA and Math results for students in grades 3-5, and any other successes or challenges that students have shown in all  content areas.   We will then create achievable goals for each student, with parents.  These goals will later be discussed at  parent teacher conferences, along with how parents can help their children achieve them.  Translators will be present for  meetings with LEP parents in the language requested on language preference and home language ID surveys. records fo these  meetings are kept on file with the ENL teachers.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents of ELLs are invited to monthly workshops held at P.S. 114, facilitated by our ENL Coordinator, EML Teacher and Parent  Coordinator. Workshop topics include Family Literacy, Understanding the State Exams and NYC Learning  Resources.  Translators are used for translation during workshops and to help call and remind parents to come.  P.S. 114 also  offers Adult Education classes for parents, including parents of ELLs who do not speak English. Adult classes in ESL are offered  on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Morning and evening sessions are offered to accommodate the needs of parents.  Adult GED classes are also offered during morning and evening sessions. P.S. 114 implements an open-door policy for parents  to reach an administrator to address their needs. Our Parent Coordinator, Carol Santana, and our ESL Coordinator, Rachael  Wasilewski, are readily available to assist ELL parents anytime they enter the building. Bilingual staff members provide on-the- spot translations in Arabic, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Urdu and French when needed and P.S. 114 enlists services from the  NYCDOE Office of Translation services when needed.     Additionally, a schedule is created that allows parents to speak with their child’s teachers using a translator during parent- teacher conferences.  With schedules, notices about conferences are translated and handed out to all students with LEP  parents, ensuring a large turnout of ELL parents.  Other activities include read aloud brunches in the native language of our  parents and students, a thanksgiving celebration and end of ESL after-school party.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Darwin Smith, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 114 Ryder Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 18K114  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication.

The Language Access Coordinator identifies families in need of translations services via utilization of the Home  Language Identification Survey, student emergency cards, and the ATS RAPL report. Additionally, parents receive a  Parent Preferred Language form at the beginning of every year and interviews are conducted by the ENL and  Language Access Coordinators. This information is managed through an excel sheet and languages are organized  by grade level and class.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    ARABIC  BAMBARA  FRENCH  HAITIAN CREOLE  ENGLISH  PUNJABI (A.K.A.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the case of an emergency, LEP parents will be contacted via phone in their native language. Staff are available who  speak the native languages of some parents. When staff is not available, the NYCDOE Interpretation line will be used.  Several staff members will be assigned in September to call families in the case of an emergency so that parents can  receive the information immediately.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff will participate in Language Access Training, which will take place during after-school professional  development time (Monday 2:20-3:35). This workshop will focus on the regulations and the steps staff must take to  ensure translation and interpretation are provided for families who need the services. The Language Access  Coordinator will prepare monthly reports of language access services completed at the school by keeping track of all  interpretation and translation services provided for the month. Monthly reports will be shared with the principal. LAC  will also attend grade-level meetings, during which he/she will ensure that each team has provided documents for  translation services when needed. Grade teams will be responsible for sending documents to LAC for translation.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The LAC ensures that a welcome poster is put up by the entrance of PS 114 in September, and it stays up all year. A  new one is put up as they are received. When parents are given the Preferred Language Form, they are told about  their rights to receive all information about their children and the school in their language. As stated above, all staff is  aware that translators must be contacted for all meetings, workshops, and discussions with LEP parents, and minors.  If staff cannot find a translator, they all have the translation line phone number so they can use it when needed  immediately. School security and main office use the Language ID form when new parents come in, and the LAC is  called immediately if a translator is needed.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         The school uses the parent surveys in the native language to gather feedback from parents and assess the quality and  availability of services provided. A translator sits with parents to ensure that all questions are understood.  Additionally, parent surveys are filled out after parent workshops to make sure that parents are happy with the  quality of services provided.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73
