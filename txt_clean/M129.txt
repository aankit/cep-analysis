This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement    Section 4: CEP Overview      At the John H. Finley Campus School, we believe that all children are entitled to a high quality education. We are  committed to developing a child-centered environment and instructional program, which will result in a community of  critical thinkers and lifelong learners. With the collaborative efforts of parents, faculty, students, and community, we   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      will empower our students to become responsible, productive and enlightened individual. We will collectively hold  ourselves accountable to ensure the following:   ● The Common Core State Standards will be utilized to provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are  expected to learn, so teachers and parents know what they need to do in order to ensure academic success.   ● Instructional programs will be developed to fully prepare our students for college, careers and beyond, to compete  successfully in the global economy.   ●Use of current and relevant student data will inform and drive standard based instructional practice.   ●All students are expected to reach high standards of proficiency- our goal is to have 90% of our students at  achievement levels 3 and above in reading and mathematics standardized tests.   ●Instructional programs will provide an environment whereby literacy will be infused in all subject areas (social  studies, science, mathematics, technology and the arts).   ●Emphasis will be paced on alignment of curriculum and assessment, in order to increase the level of student thinking  and engagement to ensure that students attain grade level performance.   Administration, staff, parents, and community stake holders are involved in a collaborative decision making    process.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The school offers a variety of special programs and community partnerships that support the development and  improvement of the school include:    Columbia Youth Adventures Weekend Program (Explorers Program) suited for students in grades 3-6.

This year, we are excited to collaborate with a teacher from one of the city's specialized schools. Creative  Achievement Success (CAS) Program creates and delivers programs that support and strengthen the academic  experience and educational attainment of 1st to 7th grade students. CAS focuses on preparing 6th and rising 7th  grade students for the Specialized High School Admission Test (SHSAT) and our Enrichment Program focuses on  elevating the educational performance of 1st through 5th graders. We are extremely thrilled to begin our  collaboration with this program as it will support our Gifted and Talented populations as well as our advanced  learners.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The John H. Finley Campus School PS/MS 129 is a community school in central Harlem, housing roughly 420 students  of diverse backgrounds. The school comprises of 2% Asian, 43% African American, 50% Hispanic, and 2% White  students.   The school’s Title I population is 86%. The diversity from our student population is also similar to the composition of  staff members. Teachers working with fewer than three years teaching experience are 10% and receive additional  professional development from the District, Central, and off-site support. Students of PS/MS 129 John H. Finley  Campus School takes an active role in much of the decision-making that occurs in the school. Students play an integral  role in selecting programs for enrichment, extra-curricular activities like Staff vs. Student tournaments, and facilitating  the student government SONYC "Schools Out New York City" - Harlem Commonwealth Council After-school Programs  allow children to participate in Homework help, career and college readiness enrichment, and team-building  activities.       In addition, Bridging the Gap initiative supports students in temporary housing with the newly created Social Worker  position. Support services are provided to students and families both during school hours and off-site as needed.  Some of the activities include college readiness, tutoring, counseling, etc. Students in Grade 7 get a jump on the  college experience through the College Access for All initiative. Students create resumes, attend local colleges and  universities as well as colleges outside of New York City. Parent workshops are offered to discuss financing a college  future and building a skill set for a career in all industries.       Students with Special Needs consist of 24% of the student body population and ENL consist of 40% of the student  body population whom are afforded opportunities to participate in tutoring, college readiness and parents participate  in English acquisition workshops offered by staff members in the building.    Another promising aspect of John H. Finley Campus School is the Parent Leadership Academy operated by the Parent  Coordinator. Monthly seminars are held to educate parents on the current trends of curriculum, Common Core  Learning Standards and educational policies. The Parent Academy establishes high expectations for parents and  depicts them as key partners in student achievement.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      English Language Arts and Mathematics 2018:    Based on the data contained by the New York state Education Department, of the students tested in ELA, 35% of  student population were proficient scoring a level 3 or 4 and 21% of the student population were proficient in Math  scoring a level 3 or 4.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the Framework for Great Schools, the area in which our school improved the most was Instructional  Core. We managed to achieve this by mastering the Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligning the instructional  shifts to the curricula, engaging and meeting the needs of all learners in order for students to provide meaningful  work. This is proven by data represented from the 2018 NYS Assessment Scores and OORS report.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 05M129   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   435   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. Relative to this Framework element, our schools strength are our Specialized High School Initiative program, the  College Access for All of which 50% of students who take the Science and Algebra regents exam, "Algebra for All", our  "Bridging the Gap" social worker, who is trained in "DIR Floor Time Therapy," Trauma Informed Focus Counseling,  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and (TCIS) Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in the Schools, effectively addresses needs of  students who require PBIS.    School leaders and staff have concentrated on deep contextual understanding in math and exposing students to a  variety of text where they cite evidence to support claims and central ideas. Teachers rely upon the Common Core  standards to drive instruction and close achievement gaps. According to the 2018 June Instructional Reports with  respect to English Language Arts, there is a sharp increase in students who "Did Not Meet" performance standards in  grades 3 through 8. In these grades more than half of the students "Did Not Meet" the achievement level mark. Based  on the most recent New York State 2018, students in grades 3-8 have shown some gains in answering multiple choice  questions and minimal gains in writing short and extended constructed responses. According to The New York City  Performance Subject Report with respect to Mathematics almost one-third of each grade failed the mathematics  exam with the exception of grade five who only had a 4% failure rate on that grade. Targeted instruction on  responding to constructed responses in math is paramount at every grade level, thus we will:     Provide guided reading and math instruction for students who are approaching and below benchmarks      Implement a positive behavior intervention system (PBIS) and whole child leadership component to prepare  students for 21st century     Provide supplemental tutoring for all students in grades 5-8 before and after school     Institute a math problem of the day that focuses on a specific strand and require students to explain their  thinking     Provide clubs and advisory support for the middle school students    Collaborative planning sessions with teacher teams to create essential questions aligned to Common Core/   Next Generation standards     Collaborative planning session with teachers who require improvement plans    Designing reliable assessments and tasks that are multi-disciplined and coherent   .

Based upon benchmarks and NYS Assessment scores, teachers will form instructional groups to support differentiation  of rigorous instruction. The overall annual growth goal is 10% in student performance to be measured by growth over  time on NYCPT in October, February and End of Year (according to DOE calendar). The mid-point benchmark (February)  expectation is 5% which will be closely monitored by way of End of Unit Performance Tasks/ Assessments on a six-week  cycle.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

School leaders provide feedback to all teachers to define rigorous instruction, working closely  with all teachers to improve close reading practices, ensuring proper CCLS alignment with activities and tasks that  meets the needs of all students and their families. Targeted professional development will be designed and provided  to support planning and implementation strategies, best practices in teaching, and parent engagement topics.  Collaborating with Education Administrators from Manhattan Field Support on trainings and supports for the Special  Education population at least 7 times throughout the school year. Inter- & Intra- visitations amongst colleagues on- site and off-site will support teacher development and adult learning. We will provide families with quarterly progress  reports to communicate student progress, weekly homework sheets, newsletters, and use Tuesday afternoons to  make phone calls and have conferences with families to express high expectations for learning and teaching. Our  Parent Coordinator will continue to host parent workshops to provide understanding of the curriculum, school wide  initiatives and other external supports for families in temporary housing. It was evidenced that more than half of the  student body believed that teachers recognize when they are upset or having emotional difficulty. Eighty percent of  our student body stated that the school provides useful information about the high school application and admission  process.       With close analysis of the School Quality surveys conducted in 2017, we need to focus our collective efforts in moving  more students with special needs into least restrictive learning environments. We also need to make all stakeholders  feel more comfortable in the hallways, stairways, and bathrooms.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The John H. Finley, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The John H. Finley School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g. ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary ACT (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.            School-Parent Compact (SPC)   The John H. Finley School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by  Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

We implement a series  of ESL methodologies as part of he Title III program to support mastering our ELLs English  language Development. The teachers will use differentiated instruction, interactive guided  reading, read aloud to students, and shared reading and writing activities.  In addition, Title III funds will be used to improve: (1)  teaching and learning in core subject  areas and (2)  to support and to increase graduation rates among our ELL  students. Materials  will be purchased from Santillana  Intensive English, Rosetta Stone CDs and DVDs levels 1  through 5, Sylvan Learning Super Reading Success, and Attanasio and Associates, Getting  reading for the NYSESLAT.  We observed the following looking at The ELL Data Analysis  Tool (EDAT)based on Spring 2018 NYSESLAT:  #ELLs with at-risk level 3 or greater = 13 students (which represents 43.3% of the total ELL  population (30 ELLs).  #ELLs with at-risk level 5 or greater =  10 students (which represents 33.3% of the total ELL  population(30 ELLs).  Based on this data, we will engage our "at Risk" ELLs in reading and writing activities to  enhance their Literacy skills. Title III funds will be used for an After School Program for our  English Language Learners (ELLs)  students in grades fifth through eight (5th - 8th) to provide  supplementary services.  The students’ levels are entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding,  and commanding.  Two licensed teachers, one bilingual teacher and one ENL teacher, will be  hired to conduct these supplemental classes.  Ms. Alexander, Bilingual Teacher, will offer the  supplemental classes to ENL/Bilingual Students in grades 5 and 6.  Mr. Vargas, ENL Teacher,  will provide the supplemental classes to ENL/Bilingual Students in grades 7, and 8.  We will  include two grades per teacher because the budget for this Title III plan is only $12,366.   Our  goals is to teach our ELLs literacy acquisition in an environment full of academic support.  The After School Program will comprise a group of 30 students. Each teacher will service a  group of 15 students. The After School Program will focus on literacy and math.   The literacy  and math is on meeting the high standards set for our ELLs.  Reading and writing will be taught  in all content areas.  Entering and emerging ELLs will have explicit instruction in phonics and  phonological awareness.  Our transitioning  and expanding ELLs will be offered literacy class  aligned with the Next Generation Learning Standards.  The math curriculum will be aligned with  ELA using ESL methodologies. Our ELLs will be grouped heterogeneously where they have the  opportunity to share and learn from each other.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   The Title III Program will comprise of 41 sessions beginning December 5, 2018 to May 30, 2019  twice a week (Wednesdays and Thursdays), for three hours from 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  The budget of $12,366, (100%) will be used for direction instruction.

Our school  plans to continue providing teachers in-school and off-site workshops and training in ELL  methodologies.      The rationale is to provide support to our staff to assist all teachers (including ELL teachers)  who provide instruction to ELL students as they transition from elementary to middle school and  college readiness for high school in many ways. Teachers receive training during common preps  and conferences.  They also are mentored by Mr. Vargas our ELL teacher, and our senior  teachers who we consider to be experts educators. All professional development sessions are  provided by the administration, outside professional agencies, and teachers of our school.  In  addition, we look for professional development offered to teachers by the DOE.  So far, we plan  to conduct the following Professional Development to our entire staff regarding ELL instruction  and methodology following the NYS and NYC standards:  This will impact the learning for ELL students by providing supporting in all content areas and to  all content area teachers in middle school.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Mr. Vargas, the ENL Teacher, along with Ms. Rowell, Parent Coordinator will plan and provide  two meetings per year for families of ELLs.  The meetings will take place in the school's  auditorium. The goal is to discuss the objectives of the TBE program and ENL program.  In  addition, we discuss language development progress, language proficiency assessment results,  and language development needs in all content areas.  Furthermore, we invite parents of ELLs to  our workshop to participate in our school events.  We have an excellent translation service in  place.  Many of our staff are fully bilingual in English and Spanish, and we also utilize the  services provided by the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit as needed.  The rationale for our Parent Leadership Academy  which meets twice per month on Thursday  helps support parents to navigate the Department of Education, in terms of available programs  and activities offered to parents, such as AR, Accelerated Reading.   The more knowledge the  parents obtain or gain about the school system the more empowered they will become.    The Parent Leadership Academy meets once monthly for ELL parents to discuss topics such as:   Navigating the DOE  Course Offerings  Academic Help for both Parents & Students     DOE Policies & Procedures  Understanding The Common Core  GED Attainment for Parents  Family Literacy  Graduation Requirements  College 7 Career Readiness  Articulation Into High School    Translated Services are always provided at every meeting in Spanish as well as French, Haitian  Creole and Arabic for parents who speak these languages.    School Newsletter/Website – information regarding school activities is also disseminated in our  School Newsletter/Website to keep parents updated on current events such as school plays, trips,  assemblies and opportunities which may enhance their knowledge.    Postings in the Main Lobby also provide another source of communication for our parents.    Daily Informal Conversations take place everyday as children are welcomed in the morning and  as they are dismissed in the afternoon.    The ELL parents will be informed about the New York State standards, assessments, school  expectations and general requirements that govern the Bilingual and ENL programs and the  importance of parental involvement in the education of their children.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    The assessment tool our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs is as follows:  We use the MOSL assessment  to evaluate their literacy acquisition: phonics, alphabet, oral expression, and reading abilities.  El SOL basically is the same  assessment, but it is conducted in Spanish.  The data obtained in these assessments reflects that our ELLs are learning to read  and write at grade level at a very rapid pace.  This information is used to plan our future classes.  The base line data is used to  group students according to their levels.  We also use the New York City Performance Assessment;  this assessment allows  teachers to plan in alignment with  the common core standards and to evaluate the children's academic progress  to move  them to higher performance levels.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school-wide assessment calendar guides us in determining the varied assessment across the school.  The data from the  assessments are used to refine and update the instructional units across the grades to meet the needs of individual/groups of  students.  Particular attention is given to students who are not making or close to making the benchmark.  These students are  provided with additional resources (push-in small group support, after school, etc.).  In addition, teachers are provided with  planning time to collaborate in teams, with administrators and across grades in an effort to support the success of the whole  child.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?    After examining the assessment results of ELLs (ELA, Mathematics, Social Studies,  and Science), the pattern across  proficiencies and grade levels of ELL student achievement scores is impressive.   Within three years, most of our ELL students  have shown to advance and acquire English language proficiency based on the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test from 2016.  Usually, our ELL students test-out of the English as a New Language program by the completion  of third grade.  Although they become proficient in the English language, they are still closely monitored and supported  through Academic Intervention Services.  However, some exceptions take place in student achievement levels when a student  comes from another country without any prior schooling, also referred as SIFEs.   In addition, due to No Child Left Behind a  constant influx of low performing students are being transferred to our school and as a result this affects our academic  achievement scores.   In addition, teachers assess all students using the Renaissance Learning Reading and Math program with  Accelerated Reader and Accelerated Math.  These assessments provide teachers with baseline information on student  proficiency in both reading and math, as well as progress monitoring and tracking plans.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data from the summative  assessment is received by the teacher,  the team will meet to review the item  analysis.  Looking at each item, will inform teachers the skills/concepts  of students' mastery and non-mastery.  The results will  also be used to guide the teachers in making adjustments to the lesson units and for regrouping of students. The data  gathered will also be used to inform parents with some next steps to support their child at home.   For example,  it may mean  that some students are assigned independent activities that require the use of technology or in-school small group tutorial.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Our school uses data obtained from our NYSESLAT Report, AMAOs, NYC ELA and Math Assessments to guide instruction for  ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework for grades K - 5.  Since RtI is an instructional model that aims at  prevention and early intervention we include its three tiers of instructional support to match the ELLs learning needs: Tier I - A  rigorous curriculum for (80%) ELLs language development.  Tier II -Extra activities targeted to (5 - 10%) specific ELL  students.  Tier III - Individualized instruction for a small group (1 - 5%) of ELL students.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The data patterns across the proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT reveals that 90% of our Kindergarten ELL  students are passing this test as soon as they take it.  This is perhaps because the majority of them attend Pre-K in the United  States and this facilitates the knowledge of communicating, speaking, listening, reading, and writing in the English language to  pass the NYSITELL.  On the other hand,  newly entrants who have no prior school experience or have never been exposed to  the English language when tested with the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT rank at the entering proficiency level.  Our ELLs excel in  acquisition of the Listening and Speaking modalities within the first three months of the school year.  According to our most  recent Spring 2017 NYSESLAT 26 ELL students achieved the Commanding Proficiency Level.  Some of these students were  Transitioning ELL students and the rest were Expanding ELLs.  The Spring 2017 NYSESLAT also reveals that 21 of our ELLs are  ranking at the Transitioning Proficiency Level which indicates that the majority of them will achieve a Commanding Proficiency  Level on next year's NYSESLAT.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The weekly collaboration between the teacher teams, administration, support staff, etc.  provide for sharing and feedback on  student progress, teacher needs and next steps.  During the Monday meetings, as well as during the common planning time,  teachers meet to review student data and make adjustments to the lesson units.  During this time, discussions also focus on  the assessment calendar and/or the need for an intermediate assessment. The lead teachers are responsible for identifying  needed resources for the grades and the administration and for adjustments in programming/scheduling.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We implement both, the Integrated and Stand alone Models in our school.  The ENL teacher implements the  Integrated Model to service Kindergarten, first, second and third graders.  The Integrated  Model is implemented in  lower grades as part of a collaborative program delivered through the content areas: English Language Arts, Math,  Science, and Social Studies.  The ENL teacher, Mr. Vargas, delivers instruction for ELLs implementing the Stand-alone  ENL program to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. The ENL teacher  plans with the general education and special education teachers to ensure curricular alignment and continuity of  instruction. The ENL Model is implemented with the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.  The students are  grouped homogeneously according to their proficiency level.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      We only offer one Eighth Grade Special Education TBE Class due to a low register.  Based on the number of student  enrollment, (which must be at least fifteen or more sharing the same home language), a  transitional bilingual class is  formulated where a licensed Bilingual instructor will instruct students. The TBE program is designed so that students  develop conceptual skills in their home language as they learn English. At the entering level, TBE students are  expected to receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English. Students receive research-based  instruction to support their learning along with visual cues, graphs, and charts.         c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We do not offer a DL program.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                Our school assures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in  each program. Also, by closely monitoring student’s attendance, instruction via teacher observation by the Principal and  Assistant Principals, review of lesson plans and monitoring attendance at parent meetings. Explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA  instruction is delivered in each program through content area instruction.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      ENL Proficiency Levels Minutes per Week:  Entering 360 minutes, Emerging 360 minutes, Transitioning 180, Expanding 180, Commanding 90 minutes.     ELA is delivered in the TBE Program through guided reading, shared reading, silent reading, reading aloud, hands-on projects,  cooperative learning, charts, graphic organizers, visual aids, technology: computers provide students the opportunity to  practice listening, reading, writing and speaking and language development.  In the ENL Program  ELA is delivered using ENL  methodologies.         ELA in TBE Proficiency Levels Minutes per Week:  Entering 360 minutes, Emerging 360 minutes, Transitioning 180 minutes, Expanding 180 minutes, Commanding 90 minutes.     HLA in TBE Proficiency Levels per Week:  Entering 360 minutes, Emerging 360 minutes, Transitioning 180, Expanding 180, Commanding 0 minutes.     HLA is delivered in the ENL program through shared reading, interactive tasks and projects, audio/visual resources,  cooperative learning providing students the opportunity to learn English as well as use their home language.  Students who  speak the same language support one another in collaborative speaking and listening tasks.   Delivery of instruction takes place in literacy and mathematics in Spanish according to the student’s acquisition level.   The  Bilingual Teacher can reinforce concepts taught in the content area in the child’s native language as well as in English.  The  classroom library will comprise of fifty percent (50%) of its library books in Spanish to promote literacy acquisition in the  student’s native language.            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Both programs (TBE, ENL) implement English language skills development and content area instruction through the use of  ENL methodologies to ensure that ELL students meet the standards and pass the required state assessments, ELA, NYSITELL,  and/or NYSESLAT.  The materials we use in Math, Social Studies, and Science in our TBE Program are in Spanish and/or English  according to the student's acquisition level.  The Bilingual Teachers reinforce concepts taught in Math, Social Studies, and  Science using Sheltered English Instruction, The SIOP Model, to enhance their language acquisition using meaningful materials,  such as books, manipulative, charts, cards, audio-visual aids, technology, illustrations, graphics, and maps.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       We ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by having teacher generated tasks and  tests.  Additionally, the New York State Assessments are available in Spanish, since our Transitional Bilingual Program is offered  in English and Spanish which is how students are measured throughout the year.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status            In order to meet the needs of our ELLs subgroups we differentiate instruction by using numerous ESL methodologies, such  as scaffolding, teacher collaboration, conferencing, and tutoring.            a)  We continuously look for instructional materials that would service our SIFE students.  We have trained our high-quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      teachers of ELLs  to work with SIFE students using current ENL strategies and differentiated instruction which will lead to  student achievement.  We will use alternative assessment options such as portfolios and tailor the curriculum to meet SIFE  students needs.            b)  In order to meet the needs of our ELL students who are newcomers, (less than three years) we will provide various  options for instruction: Transitional Bilingual Educational, ENL Push-In/Pull-Out Program, Morning Skills Period Tutorial, The  Accelerated Reader Program and After School Tutoring Program. Explicit ENL instruction is delivered in each program through  content area instruction.  Additionally, because NCLB now requires ELA testing for ELLs after one year, we will tutor the new  entrants during Morning Tutorials, 8:30am - 9:00am in order to accelerate their language acquisition abilities.             c)  Our plan for Developing ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years is to create an educational plan where the principal, assistant  principals, literacy coach, teachers and ESL teacher all collaborate using differentiated instruction to enhance their English  proficiency.  We will analyze the NYSESLAT Combined Modality Report to determine which literacy skill: reading, writing,  speaking, listening, the student needs the most help.           d)  Our reduced number of long term ELLs will have teachers provide instruction using ENL methodologies on a daily basis in  a small class setting in order to become proficient on the NYSESLAT and ELA assessments.  Teachers will receive Professional  Development and participate in training to learn how to meet the needs of ELL students and differentiate instruction for all  learners.  We will also train parents to assist their children with English language acquisition skills at home.        e)   Former ELLs, up to two years after existing ELL status, will receive .5 unit (90 minutes) of service per week of integrated  ENL in ELA/Content Area to support their language development and academic progress.  This task is going to be accomplished  using differentiated instruction in order to enhance their reading and writing skills such as close reading activities, annotation  of text, vocabulary building, educational field trips and neighborhood walks, and allowing students to act out scenes in real life  situations.   The ultimate goal is that the former ELLs could function in a mainstream classroom as any English proficient  student, where they could express their ideas, both, in spoken language or in written form with fluency. All our ELLs and  Former ELLs take readiness tests that provide teachers the Zone of Proximal Development for Reading and Math.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           Our teachers of ELL-SWDs use ESL instructional strategies, such as scaffolding, sheltered instruction, and grade level  materials to both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development.  The materials are  selected based on information gathered from data obtained from the NYSESLAT, ELA, as well as school based periodic  assessments.  Children  identified as having special needs receive support within the Bilingual Special Education class and the  ENL teacher through the integrated instructional model.  Our Special Education Support Service Teacher provides direct  instruction in a small group setting conducive to learning.                7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?         Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment.  The ENL teacher provides direct instruction to ELL students having special needs using ENL  methodologies, while the Special Education Support Service Teacher provides supplemental reading, writing and mathematics  instruction.  The Special Education Bilingual Teacher provides additional training in reading, writing and mathematics using the  Wilson and Fundations Programs. We also have assistant teachers who work on a one to one basis with individual students as  mandated on their  IEPs.  In addition, our school ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non- disabled peers by mainstreaming our ELL-SWDs in certain academic programs e.g. Math, Language Arts, Technology, and  Physical Education.  All our ELL-SWDs are included in our school wide extracurricular activities.  During Faculty Conferences and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Professional Developments flexible programming for ELL-SWDs are discussed among regular education teachers, special  education teachers, ENL teachers and bilingual teachers.  Special Education Field Supports also work with teachers and  liaisons at the school.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  P.S.129's targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, and other core content areas focus on meeting the high  standards set for our English Language Learners in literacy and mathematics.   Our goal in ELA is to provide reading instruction  to ELL students, according to their proficiency level (entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding) using the  Ready Gen, K - 5, and Code X, 6 - 8, Reading Programs.  Reading and writing strategies will be taught in all content  areas.  Entering and emerging ELLs will have explicit instruction in phonics and phonological awareness so they can identify  sounds and combine them into words.  Our transitioning and advanced ELLs will be offered literacy classes aligned with the  common cores in our school's morning tutorial period.     Our Math goal is to decrease by at least 25% the number of ELLs who are not meeting the proficiency standards on math.  The  math curriculum will be aligned vertically between the math levels using Go Math, K - 5, and CMP3, 6 -8.  Struggling students  will receive math tutoring in small groups with a trained Math Teacher.  Intervention math software will be purchased as well  as increasing utilization of computer labs to further enhance the ELLs Math skills. The ENL Teacher plans collaboratively with  the classroom teacher implementing academic rigor to further develop ELL’s achievement levels across the content areas. The  ENL teacher also reviews student portfolios with the classroom teacher as well as with the ELL student during articulation to  make assessments and drive instruction.  We also offer a ENL Program where students are grouped homogeneously according  to their NYSITELL or NYSESLAT levels.  Their Native Language, Spanish, is used to instruct our Special Ed. Bilingual 8   th   Grade  Class following the CR Part 154 mandates.  It is used to support the students’ native language and culture as an  instrument to teach the content areas and to reinforce students’ understanding of new concepts taught.       Our targeted intervention in social studies for our ELLs includes ESL methodologies implemented by a certified social studies  teacher and the ENL teacher in the Integrated ENL program.  The ELLs are grouped heterogeneously where they participate  and share information demonstrating their understanding about the history of the world and the United States.  We use the  Social Studies New York City Curriculum which address New York State Social Studies Standards.      In science we implement the Foss Curriculum with our ELLs which goes from K to 8  th  . This curriculum addresses the New  York State Science  Standards.  Our targeted intervention in science for our ELLs includes ESL methodologies implemented by a  certified science teacher and the ENL teacher in the Integrated ENL program.  The ELLs are grouped heterogeneously where  they have the opportunity to learn real science.   The ELLs learn hands-on science which is beneficial for the acquisition of  English as a New Language by speaking, listening, reading, writing and interacting.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       A Dual Language Program will be considered for the 2018-2019 school year.  We are also considering applying for the Pre- K  Bilingual program for the 2018-2019 school year.  Of course these programs will be implemented once parents choose this  option and funds are available.                10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    We did not close any Bilingual Programs.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   In our school, all the ELL children are offered equal opportunities to participate in all school programs.  We offer two After  School Programs: YMCA for elementary students and Harlem Commonwealth Council (HCC) for the middle school students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      The After School Programs are available from Mondays to Fridays from 2:30pm to 5:30pm.  The ELL students are grouped  heterogeneously with monolingual students, offering them an opportunity to share, socialize, and learn in a diversified  environment.  In our After School Program, the ELL children not only do curricular activities, such as reading and their  homework, but they also have extracurricular activities such as music lessons, arts and craft, dance, technology, and sports.            12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.    Our teachers use many educational resources and strategies when instructing the ELL’s and the entire classroom  population.  We use the Balanced Literacy Program which includes reading books at all levels, Reading Textbooks in the  content areas, The Accelerated Reader Program, The Go Math ( K - 5) and CMP3  (6 - 8) Mathematics Programs, Social Studies  and  Science textbooks, Technology through the use of computers and specific software programs, participation in our  Band/Orchestra, Sports activities, Visual Arts aids, Listening Centers, Big Books, Clearly Labeled/Leveled Libraries, Word Walls,  Charts, Overhead Projectors and use of  Kaplan,  Leap Frog, and Santillana Programs.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home Language support is offered in various ways.  In the TBE Program delivery of instruction takes place in literacy and  mathematics in Spanish according to the student’s acquisition level.   The Bilingual Teacher can reinforce concepts taught in  the content area in the child’s native language.  The classroom library will have fifty percent (50%) of its library books in  Spanish to promote literacy acquisition in the student’s native language.  As students progress and their levels improve, the  amount of English instruction increases and the amount of Spanish instruction decreases.  Our ELL students are serviced by  their language proficiency level.  Students are serviced using the Integrated ENL Model through the content areas: English  Language Arts, Math, Social Studies, science and English Language development instruction from a dually certified teacher or  two certified teachers. Upper grade ELL students are serviced using the Stand-alone English as a New Language Model in which  students receive instruction in order to acquire the English language needed for success in core content courses.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      The resources and services offered in our school correspond with the ELLs' ages and grade levels.  Our reading books are  leveled, meaning that the students will always have enough resources at their reading level.  In addition, we make sure each  ELL has a ENL text book that matches their reading proficiency: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and  commanding.  We partner with local libraries and schools that have extensive libraries with books in other  languages.  Ordering is also completed through Title III funding allocations.       Our teachers use many educational resources and strategies when instructing the ELL’s and the entire classroom  population.  We use the Balanced Literacy Program which includes reading books at all levels, Reading Textbooks in the  content areas, The Accelerated Reader Program, The Go Math ( K - 5) and CMP3  (6 - 8) Mathematics Programs, Social Studies  and  Science textbooks, Technology through the use of computers and specific software programs, participation in our  Band/Orchestra, Sports activities, Visual Arts aids, Listening Centers, Big Books, Clearly Labeled/Leveled Libraries, Word Walls,  Charts, Overhead Projectors and use of  Kaplan,  Leap Frog, and Santillana Programs.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     We do not share a building with any other schools.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     When students are registered, throughout the school year, parents are invited to attend informational meetings and parent  orientations to learn about the various programs: Dual Language, Transitional Bilingual Education, and English as a New   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Language programs. We also invite parents and their newly enrolled ELLs to stay in school for one full day to be part of a series  of activities, such as touring the school building, the cafeteria, the auditorium, gymnasium, and the playground.  The newly  enrolled ELL is offered coloring pages, crayons/pencils to draw,  books to read, and access to a computer the same day that  he/she is registered.   Mr. Vargas, the ENL teacher; Ms. Mendez, school counselor; and Ms. Rowell, parent coordinator are  responsible for introducing the parents and newly enrolled ELLs to the teachers, so they can feel welcome.  School tours are  also offered to familiarize the newly enrolled students.  We use the buddy system to help accumulate students transition into  the school community.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     The only language elective we offer to ELLs is Spanish, other than that everyone is mandated to take English.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?     We have had several professional development sessions for all teachers in which the focus was bilingual education and ENL  services:  A) Accelerated Reading Program for ELLs       September 11, 2017  B)  Curriculum Mapping for English Language Learners    September 18, 2017  C)  Professional Responsibilities: Assessments and Placement of ELLs  October 2017  D)  MOSL Assessments: Testing Criteria for ELLs October 2017     Our school plans to continue providing teachers in-school and off-site workshops and training in ENL methodologies.

We provide handouts that go along with the presentation.  We take attendance that will be  kept in the Principal's office for future reference as part of our ENL/Bil. Program records.         The following professional developments will be offered to teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the  Common Core Learning Standards:   A)  Translating Theory to Practice to meet Challenges of the Common Core State Standards    B)  Fundamental Elements of Classroom Instruction and Effective Pedagogy for ELLs    C)  Response to Intervention: Creating an RtI Model for ELLs' Academic Success     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         D)  The Common Core: Supporting Social and Academic Language Development of ELLs         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    We provide support to our staff to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school in many ways.  Teachers  receive training during commom preps and conferences.  These are some of the activities that we implement in our school:  conferencing, co-teaching, modelling, curriculum mapping, scaffolding, peer tutoring, implementing ENL methodologies, and  parent's participation.  They also are mentored by our our senior teachers who we consider to be experts educators.         The following professional developments will be offered to bilingual/ENL teachers and our entire staff as part of the 15%     minimum required professional development hours for all teachers:     A)  Translating Theory to Practice to meet Challenges of the Common Core State Standards    B)  Fundamental Elements of Classroom Instruction and Effective Pedagogy for ELLs    C)  Response to Intervention: Creating an RtI Model for ELLs' Academic Success    D)  The Common Core: Supporting Social and Academic Language Development of ELLs          So far, we plan to conduct the following Professional Development to our bilingual/ENL teachers regarding language  acquisition in    alignment with core content area instruction as part of the 50% required professional development hours:               Assessment, Evaluation, and Placement of ELL students (September 2017)     ESL Methodologies and ENL instruction in the classroom (November  2017)     ESL Learning Standards (December 2015)     How to Plan Differentiated Instruction for the 4 Levels of English Literacy (January 2018)     Supporting Bilingual and ELL Needs For Standardized Tests and Beyond (March 2018)     Every time our school offers a professional development we create an agenda with a topic and the points that will be  implemented on that session.  We provide handouts that go along with the presentation.  We take attendance that will be  kept in the Principal's office for future reference as part of our ENL/Bil. Program records.                Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    Mr. Vargas, the ENL Teacher will plan and provide one annual meeting with parents of ELLs in the auditorium of our school to  discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all content areas.  This individual meeting for parents of ELLs will be scheduled on the first week of June  2016.  This additional meeting will include other school staff and administrators: Ms. Pierre, principal;  Ms. Amaro, Special  Education TBE teacher; Ms. Mendez, school counselor and Ms. Rowell, parent coordinator to inform and support parents  about their children academic progress.  A translator will be provided if the parent does not speak or understand the English  language.  Mr. Vargas, Ms. Amaro, and Ms. Mendez are fully bilingual in English and in Spanish.  We have two teachers who   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66            are fluent in French, Haitian Creole and English (Ms. Flechier and Ms. Sanon).  This allows us to communicate with parents  whose dominant language is French.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.     Both, our general education and ELL's parents participate in our school affairs.  Many parents volunteer on a regular  basis.  They assist teachers in the classroom, e. g. bulletin boards,  family night,  mother-son dance,  father-daughter  dance,  perfect student assembly, student of the month, and/or when their children go on trips.  Our ELL Parents are actively  engaged in our Parent Teacher Association and in our Parent Leadership Academy.  We have an excellent translation service in  place.  Many of our staff are fully bilingual in English and Spanish.  We translate all our letters from English to Spanish. Two  teachers are fully bilingual in English and French.  They translate our letters to ELL parents whose preferred language is French.  Our nurse speaks French and Arabic. She translate our letters to ELL parents whose preferred language is Arabic. We can also  find translated documents  into Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and Urdu at NYC  DOE Intranet. Last but not least, we  use the written translation services provided by the DOE Translation and Interpretation  Unit, only when needed.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Odelphia Pierre, Principal, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   John H.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At P.S. 129M, when students are registered for the first time in the public school system, parents are asked to  complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) provided by the pupil accountant secretary with the  assistance of Mr. Vargas, the ENL Teacher, to assess language preferences of the parent community for both  written and oral communication. In addition to the HLIS, we collect data using ATS Report of Preferred Languages,  Blue Cards, and Teacher Surveys. If the home language is other than English or student's native language is other  than English, the ENL teacher conducts the informal interview in English or the student's native language. Using  the Home Language Identification Survey we determine the primary language spoken by each parent and their  children. This information is recorded and maintained on each student's emergency card, Home Language  Identification Survey, and on the New York City DOE ATS Data Base. Parents are invited to attend informational  meetings and parent orientations within the first ten days of school enrollment, Fall and Spring, to learn about the  various programs: Dual Language, Transitional Bilingual Education, and English as a New Language programs.  Translated services are always provided at every meeting in Spanish. We show a New York State Video about  these programs in the parent's preferred language, and we also distribute handouts to better inform parents.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Parents are also given surveys and choice forms in order to choose the program in which they would like their  child to attend. Parents have opportunities to set up individual meetings with the Principal, Assistant Principal,  our Parent Coordinator, Bilingual Teachers and the ENL teacher to further discuss their options as well, in their  preferred language. After reviewing our Parent Surveys which are available in their preferred language, we set up  services according to ELL student needs and parent choices of programs. Ample supplies of surveys are kept  available in various languages: Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic, Bengali, among others.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
