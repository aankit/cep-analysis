This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At I.S. 61, we embrace Leadership as we sculpt our community to be the best version of themselves.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our mission statement is the driving force behind everything we do here at I.S. 61. We welcome all that enter our  school, as a community of leaders whose commitment is to ensure positive contributions to our world by creating  well rounded, highly motivated individuals.  It is important to note that we chose the term ‘leader’ as opposed to ‘learner.’ In training our students and staff in the  7 habits of highly effective leaders, they are trained to be proactive among the other habits which includes the choice  to turn every moment into a teachable one thus we are all learners that take leadership roles within our school  community.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We consider all of our students to have specific needs and our mission is to meet the needs of all learners. We have a  predominant ESL population. Within that population, we focus on understanding the culture of each child’s  background as they try to assimilate into our school culture. We understand there is a transition period that entails  and we work as closely with those students using ESL strategies for instruction and including them in leadership  positions including greeting students from the same culture.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our key area of focus for the Framework for Great Schools will be Rigorous Instruction. We have found it critical to  improve our instruction to continue to meet our students’ needs to increase their level of achievement by moving up  a level from pre- to post- test throughout every unit of study within every discipline including the arts. With a focus on  improving instruction through professional development, training, and alignment of curriculum to CCLS, redesigning  rubrics and goal sheets; we believe we can increase our students’ pre to post test gains and as a result move the  students up a level from pre- to post- test.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q061   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   2238   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.   ● Our Network Human Resource Director verifies the credentials of all candidates to ensure that they hold a valid  NYS certification in the correct license area.  ● The BEDS survey is used to ensure that all teachers are teaching within their license area.  ● We interview Highly Qualified Teachers from the New Teacher Finder, The Open Market Hiring System, and the  Absent Teacher Reserve Pool.  ● We provide teachers with instructional resources and professional learning opportunities designed to ensure  high quality instruction.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    ● Effective professional development is focused on the improvement of student learning through the  improvement of the skill and knowledge of educators. I.S. 61 promotes specific professional development  activities that are anchored in Charlotte Danielson’s rubric of teacher effectiveness over a period of time to  improve students’ demonstrated knowledge and skill levels in reading, writing and mathematics, as measured by  portfolios of student work, Common Core aligned assessments and state examinations. Similarly, effective  professional development is connected to questions of content and pedagogy that are related to instructional  practices as well as general effective teaching practices. Professional development, therefore, is designed to  develop the capacity of teachers to work collectively on problems of practice as well as to support the knowledge  and skill development of individual educators.  ● First and second year teachers will be assigned to mentors to help provide additional instructional support.  Mentoring sessions will include some of the following practices: set goals, plan (agendas and action plans) and  establish targets; review progress in implementing content specific instructional design; collect, analyze and  monitor student performance results. By meeting together, teachers and mentors will be able strategically build  capacity and sustain change to produce and maintain high levels of student achievement as well as align  standards, curriculum, assessment, instruction and instructional materials to improve performance capabilities of  students and teachers.  ● We program Common Planning time for teachers of the same subject to meet weekly. This provides time for  nurturing new teachers as they work with teachers that are experts in their content as well as in implementing  best practices with research based instructional strategies.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31     Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     We follow the city’s guidelines for having a MOSL selection committee. We have also purchase a web-based software  program where lead Teachers can upload departmental assessments and all teachers can upload formative  assessments. Teachers will meet to review the results of every assessment to inform their instruction and the  revisions to the curriculum deemed necessary after close analysis of multiple reports for each assessment.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. IS 61, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      I.S. 61 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35   Parental Involvement and School Quality      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input.    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36         ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The general goal of the Title III direct instruction  supplemental program will be to provide students from all of these three subgroups with  opportunities to grow academically, particularly with respect to English language acquisition in  all four modalities: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. In particular,  this program will help  newcomer ELLs and SIFE to move up at least one proficiency level and long-term ELLs to reach  the Commanding level and test out on the NYSESLAT. The after school supplemental program  will run four three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 3:15pm to  4:45pm. The before school program will run twice a week on Thursdays and Fridays from  7:30am to 8:30am. These programs will begin on 10/22/18 and end on 05/31/19. The instruction  will be delivered in English by licensed ENL teachers and dually certified bilingual Math and  Science teachers. Instruction will be provided to groups of up to 25 students. Students will be  grouped by grade level. In the before school program, students will receive language instruction  from ENL licensed pedagogues. In the after school program, four groups of Spanish-speaking  newcomers admitted for the first time in 2017 and 2018 will receive instruction in Math and  Science from bilingual math teachers and bilingual science teachers. On Mondays and Tuesdays,  two groups will meet with the math teachers and the other two groups will meet with the science  teachers. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, all four groups will switch their content areas.  Language instruction for these groups will be provided by push-in ENL certified teachers. The  other four groups of students in this program will receive language instruction from ENL  certified teachers.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Within each grade level class, students will be grouped based on one of or a combination of the  following:  students' language proficiency levels as demonstrated on the most recent  NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, students' most recent achievements on the statewide exams, and  students' scores on the pre/post 'in-house' assessments focused on specific academic skills. The  main focus of the program will be to further develop academic reading comprehension and  writing skills as well as to expand students' academic vocabulary. Teachers will be using a  combination of published materials aligned with the CCLS, such as "Finish Line for ELLs",  GoMath, ACHIEVE3000 and in-house created materials.  Instruction will be provided mainly in  English with the home language support. All students will be provided with word-to-word  dictionaries and Spanish speaking students will be encouraged to use the Spanish language  component of ACHIEVE 3000 both in class and at home. The Title III funding will be used to  purchase 200 ACHIEVE3000 licenses for use in the after school and before school programs.  Title III funding will be also used to purchase 200 copies of Finish Line for ELLs for the  appropriate grade/proficiency levels. Parents will be informed about the before/after school  supplemental programs by letters of consent in their home language which they will have to sign  and return in order for their children to participate in the program. These letters will be kept on  file at school.         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                  Professional development is one of the major components of the Danielson's Framework for  Teaching. It is highly important for all teachers to continuously grow and develop professionally.  Since 87% of all our students speak a language other than English at home and 65% of all  students at IS 61 are current or former ELLs, every teacher in the building is essentially a teacher  of ELLs regardless of their content area. Throughout the school year, ENL/Bilingual licensed  teachers and other teachers of ELLs will participate in professional development workshops and  study groups in order to learn and expand upon specific strategies and techniques to help  students achieve their greatest potential.  This school year we will continue to use the data from  pre and post assessment and performance tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of the rigorous ENL  curriculum set in place. The curriculum developed by the ENL department will be continuously  refined to further align it with the CCLS. ENL teachers will analyze and discuss student data at  the weekly department common planning meetings. This will be at no cost to Title III  funding. ENL/Bilingual teachers and other teachers of ELLs will be also consistently encouraged  to use the free online educator resourses provided by the DELSS such as "Scaffolding Instruction  for ELLs: Resource Guide for ELA and Mathematics", "Common Core Videos for ELL  Instruction",  as well as other free online resources at  http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/ELL/EducatorResources/default.htm. This will be at no cost to  Title III funding. In addition, professional development for the ENL teachers involved in the  Title III before/after school program will be provided on-site by an ENL consultant from CITE.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42         Part C: Professional Development   In October 2018 - April 2019, the CITE representative will meet with each ENL teacher  individually to address their specific professional needs. The main focus will be placed on  effective ENL strategies for Newcomers and Long-Term ELLs, vocabulary development for all  ELLs, and the use of technology as a vehicle to promote second language acquisition. The  consultant will also provide a series of 1.5 hour workshops based on  the program needs, as  evidenced by walkthroughs and teacher debriefing meetings. Title III funds will be used to  provide this professional development. The tentative schedule of these PD sessions will be as  follows:  Session 1Topic: Effective strategies for Long-Term ELLs.Rationale: 27% of our current ELLs  are LTEs.Date: 12/2018 Session 2Topic: Effective strategies for Newcomer ELLs.Rationale:  45% of our current ELLs are newcomers.Date: 01/2019 Session 3Topic: Project Based Learning  for ELLs.Rationale: To diversify the arsenal of reading instruction.Date: 01/2019 Session  4Topic: The use of technology to promote second language acquisition.Rationale: Technology  has become an integral part of education.Date: 02/2019 Session 5Topic: Developing all four  language modalities during ENL instruction.Rationale: To ensure holistic language  instruction.Date: 02/2019 Session 6Topic: Academic vocabulary development for all  ELLs.Rationale: Students need to build and expand their academic vocabulary to succeed in  content areas.Date: 03/2019  Agendas and attendance sheets and copies of handouts for each PD sessions will be kept on  record in the Title III binder.  In addition the interactive school website (www.davinci61.com) now has an eLearning page  where ENL strategies, turn-key of PD opportunities, and customized toolkits for specific classes  are shared.  This will allow all staff to access information useful to improving their instruction of  ELLs.      Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To guide instructional planning for our ELLs our ENL teachers are using our own teacher-created ENL assessments. These  assessment are administered at the beginning and at the end of each thematic unit of instruction and are fully aligned with the  CCLS. Students are assessed on their progress in reading skills, their knowledge of language conventions, and in vocabulary  acquisition. Along with these formal assessments, ENL teachers are also using their on-going classroom observations and  conference notes to inform and differentiate instruction.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our ENL teachers work in grade level teams throughout the entire school year to revise the existing assessments and/or create  new ones, e.g., this year we are working on creating pre tests and post tests for ELLs who have been in the US for less than one  year and are at the Entering level of language proficiency.  At the weekly common planning meeting, our ENL teachers discuss the test results aggregated by specific students groups   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         such as newcomers, SWD, long-term ELLs, etc. Our teachers also share their classroom observations and other noticings  regarding students' language development.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To identify baseline, progress and areas of need, our ENL teachers use the results of the NYSESLAT. The NYSESLAT has proved  to be the most useful tool since it provides a breakdown by students' progress modality: Speaking, Listening, Reading, and  Writing.    In 2017-2018 we began to use the HLA Assessment which will provide our bilingual teachers with baseline, progress and areas  of need in developing students' home language (Spanish). We will continue using the HLA Assessment in 2018-2019.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Throughout the school year during common planning and department meetings on a weekly basis, the ENL teachers discuss  the effectiveness of the the targeted academic interventions and make adjustments if necessary.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   During the school day, at-risk ELLs are provided support services through AIS (Academic Intervention Services). Such services  are provided by a licensed pedagogue in a small group setting. Students are pulled out from their ELA classes up to two times  per week and are given instruction in the area of their personal academic need: reading comprehension and skills or writing.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   To evaluate and inform our ELL programs, our ENL teachers use the results of all state-wide tests including the NYSESLAT. The  NYSESLAT has proved to be the most useful tool since it provides a breakdown of students' progress by modality: Speaking,  Listening, Reading, and Writing. This helps our ENL teachers differentiate instruction by grouping students according to their  individual needs.   At the beginning of the school year, the ENL department supervisor and ELL coordinator use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to  identify areas of progress and students at risk. This information is then presented to all ENL teachers.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the school year, all ENL teachers are provided with the RLAT and RESI from ATS. At the first department  meeting of the year, our ELL coordinator presents a detailed analysis of the RLAT: number of students who moved up at least  one proficiency level during the last school year including the ELLs who reached the Commanding level, breakdown of the  current year's ELLs by proficiency and grade level, and any other useful data based on the RLAT. During the school, our ENL  teachers are provided the updated version of RLAT and RESI once a month.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         At IS 61, instruction for ELLs has been aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), and delivery of ENL  services is implemented as per CR Part 154.2 through a combination of stand-alone ENL classes and an integrated/co- teaching model. ELLs are grouped in classes of up to 30 students according to their grade level and travel together as  a group. There are no ungraded ENL classes in our school.  The large number of ELLs in our school allows us to group them in heterogeneous classes. Most ELL classes have  students at three or more consecutive proficiency levels, e.g., Entering/Emerging/Transitioning, or  Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding. Some ELL classes also include former ELLs who tested out on the NYSESLAT  more than two years ago.  Stand-alone ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by licensed ENL teachers up to 180 minutes per week  based on their proficiency level in a combination of two-period blocks or separate 45-minute periods of instruction  depending on the class schedule.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by either a team of a licensed ENL teacher and a subject  teacher or by a dually-licensed subject-area teacher (e.g. ELA and ENL). Students receive up to 180 minutes of  integrated instruction based on their proficiency level.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     ELLs in the TBE program are grouped in heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels) classes of up to 30 students  according to their grade level and travel together as a group.   Standalone ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by licensed ENL teachers up to 180 minutes per week  based on their proficiency level in a combination of two-period blocks or separate 45-minute periods of instruction  depending on the class schedule.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by either a team of a licensed ENL teacher and a subject  teacher or by a dually-licensed subject-area teacher (e.g. ELA and ENL). Students receive up to 180 minutes of  integrated instruction based on their proficiency level.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Currently there is one DL class in 6th grade and one DL class in 8th grade which include both current and former ELLs.  There are 30 students in each DL class and each class travels together as a group. In the future school years, we are  planning to maintain one DL class similar to the current one in each grade.   Stand-alone ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by a licensed ENL teacher up to 180 minutes per week  based on their proficiency level in a combination of two-period blocks or separate 45-minute periods of instruction  depending on the class schedule.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided as per CR Part 154.2 by either a team of a licensed ENL teacher and a subject  teacher or by a dually-licensed subject-area teacher (e.g. ELA and ENL). Students receive up to 180 minutes of  integrated instruction based on their proficiency level.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   I.S. 61 implements Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE), English as a New Language (ENL), and Dual Language programs  in accordance with CR Part 154 and Title III guidelines for general and special education English Language Learners (ELLs) in  order to support the development of English proficiency and literacy in a rigorous academic context. These programs run from  September through June and licensed Bilingual and ENL teachers deliver instruction to these students. All students at the  Entering and Emerging levels of English language proficiency receive the mandated 2 units (360 minutes) of ENL instruction a  week which include 1 unit of stand-alone ENL instruction provided by a licensed ENL teacher and 1 unit of integrated ENL/ELA  or other content area instruction provided by a licensed ENL teacher co-teaching with a content area teacher. Students at the  Transitioning level receive at least the required 1 unit of integrated ENL. Students at the Expanding level of proficiency receive  at least 1 unit of integrated ENL instruction and former ELLs (students who achieved the Commanding level of proficiency on  the NYSESLAT in the past two years) receive transitional ENL services of at least 0.5 unit of integrated ENL instruction.  All students at the ENL, TBE, and DL programs receive the mandated 2 units of ELA instruction per week. All students in the  TBE and DL programs receive 1 unit of mandated HLA instruction.  Data from the the most recent NYSESLAT and NYSITELL determines the structure and the implementation of ENL instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ELLs in all program models are provided with all the mandated units of content area instruction in ELA, Math, Science, and  Social Studies at the corresponding grade level. In the TBE and DL programs, the content area teachers are also certified  bilingual teachers and are highly-proficient in Spanish. They deliver differentiated content area instruction fully aligned with  the CCLS in both languages: English and Spanish, according to the Home Language Usage and Support guidelines for these  bilingual programs.  In the ENL program, ESL teachers support their content area co-teachers by helping to facilitate the infusion of vocabulary and  comprehension skills, as well as incorporating effective ENL strategies into content instruction. During content area co- teaching periods, ENL educators teach processing and literacy skills in order to help make content comprehensible to ELLs.  Content area teachers teaching in the ENL program apply content-specific differentiation strategies and ENL scaffolds to  ensure that their students can access the concepts being presented. All content area teachers of ELLs are provided with  content-specific bilingual glossaries approved by the NYSED.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In order to evaluate ELLs in their home languages throughout the year, content area teachers of ELLs utilize various translation  services to obtain copies of content area assessments translated into home languages of their students. All students in the TBE  and DL programs including all ELLs and all EPs take the HLA Periodic Assessment in the fall and spring.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE  From the RSFE report generated through ATS, we have identified 14 SIFE students who are current ELLs. Screening for  newcomer SIFE takes place at the point of entry to our school. This includes the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS),  NYSITELL, the Spanish LAB for Spanish-speaking students, and the Oral Interview Questionnaire. In addition to these formal  assessment tools, we use teacher observations and analysis of student class work. Data from these various sources flags  students as potential SIFE ELLs. Teachers then interview these students to determine whether they qualify as SIFE. Teachers  can also reach out to parents in order to learn more about students' cultural and familial backgrounds. Moreover, feedback  from these assessments informs literacy instruction in Home Language Arts. Students who have been initially identified as SIFE  then take the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) in order to finalize this process. During the school year our school’s SIFE  team continues to use a number of different measures to monitor SIFE ELLs such as writing samples in English and their home  language, grades and tests scores, informal conferencing with students during ENL or content area lessons.  IS 61 was very fortunate to participate in SIFE-targeted grants and to procure through the DOE targeted funding such program  as ACHIEVE3000. However, due to the many different after school programs offered to students through Title I, and outside  agencies that operate in our school building after hours such as NYJTL, and the different responsibilities that preclude our  students from attending the extended day sessions, we can ensure that only most SIFE can participate in the targeted SIFE  solution programs. For this reason, these programs have been integrated into the quality, sound instructional program that  students encounter on a daily basis. Even students who are not SIFE benefit from these programs as they allow  for differentiation of instruction. By implementing them, we are being proactive, and taking steps to increase the students'  language proficiency.   Along with ENL instruction, all our ELLs including SIFE also receive an extra period per week of instruction in social studies and  science.  In order to address the socio-emotional needs of SIFE, our teacher actively include them into weekly advisory sessions that  are provided to all students at IS 61. During these sessions students learn essential life skills in an engaging way through the 7  Habits of Highly Effective Teenagers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Newcomers  During the ENL instruction newcomer ELLs receive targeted instruction which utilizes differentiation strategies and proficiency  level/age appropriate instructional materials such as authentic informational texts at various lexile levels, picture dictionaries,  vocabulary flash-cards, etc.  During the work period, tiered activities are used to target the varied language proficiency needs  within the students' ZPDs (Zone  of Proximal Development). As a rule, newcomers are placed into heterogeneous classes with  ELLs of at least two other English proficiency levels.  In our classrooms, teachers are encouraged to partner newcomers with a buddy student who speaks the same language in  order to provide academic assistance as needed as well as to expedite the process of adaptation to the U.S. school system.  Along with addressing newcomers' socio-emotional needs, this provides for multiple opportunities to learn not only from the  teachers but also from other students.   Parents of newcomer ELLs also need a lot of support from all members of the school community in order to facilitate the  transition into the new culture and school system. Through translation funding, teachers and paraprofessionals can receive per  session compensation for performing any of the following services outside of the school day:  -Communicating information about the school's academic program and students' participation;  -Providing information about a child's academic performance and approaches to increasing achievement, i.e., during open  school week / parent teacher conferences;  -Enhancing parents' understanding of academic standards, assessments and tests;  -Informing parents about NCLB choice and supplementary education services and other Department of Education programs  that offer challenging learning opportunities;  -Translating home – school communications for immediate dissemination;  -Recording messages for automated phone system in order to increase student and parent participation in school activities;     Developing ELLs  During the ENL instruction developing ELLs receive targeted instruction which includes various differentiation strategies  and proficiency level/age appropriate instructional materials such as authentic informational texts at various lexile levels, short  stories, excerpts from literary works, Power-Point presentations, video clips, etc. During the work period, tiered activities are  used to target the varied language proficiency needs within the students' ZPDs (Zone od Proximal Development). As a rule,  newcomers are placed into heterogeneous classes with ELLs of at least two other English proficiency levels one of them being  either Expanding or Commanding. This creates opportunities for learning not only from teachers but also from students at a  higher level of language  proficiency. During work period, based on the results of various assessments such as ELA exam, NYSESLAT, and ENL unit  pre/post tests, developing students are grouped in small groups of four to five students to work on the task that would be  both doable and challenging at the same time with the scaffolds necessary to facilitate learning in the students' ZPDs. Our ENL  teachers use the RLAT report to identify the language modalities that developing students need to focus on in order to  improve their overall language proficiency. Teachers use this data to inform their instruction and develop custom-made  activities to address students learning needs.     Long-Term ELLs  I.S. 61 continues to support long-term ELLs by providing them with group instruction as well as with individualized instruction  during ENL teachers' menu periods. In the classroom, instruction about grammatical forms and structures is embedded  into meaningful activities. ENL instruction integrates literacy with academic content. To further engage students, teachers  draw on  students' cultural and linguistic backgrounds and life experiences.   Through the RYOS report, we identified 203 Long-term ELLs (LTEs). This is almost 23% of the total number of ELLs in our school.  In the past two years we have managed to reduce the number of LTEs from 24.5% to the current 23%. In an effort to move our  LTEs in accomplishing the goal of English language proficiency, their teachers provide them with the academic language  necessary to succeed. Data driven differentiation, including small group remediation used within the work period of a lesson,  is paramount. Instruction is geared toward helping our long-term ELLs build literacy skills and strategies, such as: inferring,  identifying the main idea, and identifying cause and effect, so that they may eventually internalize the habits of proficient  readers and writers, which will equip them for their journey as life-long learners.  The use of books on tape, reinforcing the  read-aloud in the listening center,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      increase comprehension and fluency. All lessons for LTEs are based on the CCLS. The new ENL curriculum developed by our  ENL department is a comprehensive program that offers research-based methods for vocabulary development, reading  comprehension, as well as the writing process. This curriculum is based on a set of the most important reading skills as well as  language and vocabulary skills. It incorporates scaffolding techniques and comprehension strategies including close reading,  RACE, and graphic organizers, and is accompanied by a set of grade appropriate texts that help students answer the essential  question of each unit. Long-Term ELLs will continue to be targeted in before and after school programs.     Transitional Support of Former ELLs  All newly proficient students receive 0.5 unit of integrated ENL instruction as per CR Part 154. They are also offered  the  opportunity to participate in the Title III Program for ELLs. They are also invited to partake in any other  activities offered  to ELLs. Monitoring of their progress and providing the monolingual teachers with support through professional  development opportunities helps these students as they continue learning English in a supportive environment. All former  ELLs who achieved the Commanding level of proficiency within the last two years receive the same testing accommodations as  current ELLs: extended time, separate location, simultaneous use of translated editions of the test if available, and bilingual  glossaries. This will affect almost 220 students this school year. Many newly proficient students sit side by side with their  current ELL classmates in mixed GE/ELL classes. This arrangement is beneficial for both current ELLs who are being  mainstreamed and the newly proficient students who have this additional support to supplement and reinforce language  learning.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs plan and deliver their CCLS-aligned instruction based on their students' IEPs. To provide access to  academic  content areas and accelerate English language development, teachers of ELL-SWD use various assessment tools such  state-wide tests, periodic assessments, and unit pre/post tests to determine the entry points for the content area instruction.  Content-area teachers also collaborate with ENL teachers to identify the academic vocabulary words and language structures  related to each individual lesson that may need to be 'pre-loaded' in order to make the content more accessible. During the  lesson both content area and ENL teachers work together to differentiate the instruction to groups of ELLs or individual  students. All content area materials are selected by both content area and ENL teachers in collaboration to make sure they are  grade-level appropriate and address the IEP goal(s) and language acquisition needs of each individual student.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order to enable our ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency along with self-contained 12-1 and 12- 1-1 classes we have a large number of ICT-ELL classes with no more than 12 students with IEPs and 18 students without IEPs.  This brings the total number of students in such a class to 30 which makes it the least restrictive environment. Teachers of our  ICT-ELL classes use the same CCLS-aligned curriculum for content areas and ENL instruction as any other class without SWDs.  Contents area teachers and special education teacher as well as ENL teacher work together as a team to plan instruction for  their ELL-SWDs. Twice a month, they meet for 45 minutes in academy inquiry groups to discuss their students' progress and  plan further instruction. ELL-SWDs are also encouraged to attend the after-school activities where they receive extra  instruction in various content areas as well as in the English language in the least restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At IS 61 we have a wide range of intervention programs for ELLs in various content areas. ELA and ESL teachers use Word  Generation, ACHIEVE3000, and MyOn Reading to supplement their language instruction in English for Newcomer ELLs. Math  teachers of ELLs use Destination Success Math in both English and Spanish to supplement their instruction in Math for  Newcomer and Developing ELLs in both TBE and ENL programs.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      In the upcoming school year we will continue using ACHIEVE3000, Word Generation and MyOn Reading. The schools has  purchased one hundred student licenses for ACHIEVE3000 to be used in the beginner TBE classes and after-school Title III  program. We will introduce the Spanish version of Word Generation into HLA instruction. We are also going to try out using  two new free online programs: NewsELA.com and BreakingNewsEnglish.com  Our school is also going to purchase more SmartBoards to install in the classrooms. In the next two school years virtually every  classroom will have at least five laptops available for group/individual work. There will be up to five carts with 16 laptops  assigned to each floor and teachers will be able to sign up for them through the school's website.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs at IS 61 are afforded equal access to all school programs. Just like any other students in the building during the school day  along with with all the mandated academic subjects our ELLs receive one period of Talent program per week which is a menu  of art, dance, and music. Once a week all students including ELLs participate in an advisory session. In the daytime, ELLs also  receive AIS based on their academic needs. All ELLs also have equal access to all after school programs offered at IS 61 such as  NYJTL, SES, and Title III.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support ELLs IS 61 teachers use content area curricula fully aligned with the CCLS. Curriculum planning teams in each  content area have been developing their curricula for the past four years. Along with other essential elements it includes  instructional materials that are grade/level appropriate and linguistically challenging to promote language development.  As  per CCLS 60% of all texts used in class are informational/non-fiction texts, e.g., Word Generation program. Each Word  Generation unit is one week long and contains activities addressing all the four major content areas: ELA, Math, Science, Social  Studies. The Spanish version of each Word Generation unit is used by ENL teachers to provide home language support. Each  unit of this program has activities that address the four language modalities: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Teachers  of ELLs also make an extensive use of web-based programs such ACHIEVE3000 and MyOn Reading for differentiated instruction  in reading. A large number of classroom are equipped with SmartBoards and all content teachers of ELLs are provided with  projecting devices and laptops to enhance visual learning.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Along with the explicit instruction in Spanish in TBE and Dual Language students are provided with instructional materials, e.g.,  texts, in Spanish to support Spanish academic language development in all major content areas. In Home Language Arts  classes, TBE and DL students read highly-engaging texts in Spanish provided by the Spanish version of the Word Generation  program.  All eligible students in all three programs: TBE, DL, and ESL, are provided with an NYSED-approved content area glossaries in  their home language. Content area teachers make considerable efforts to have on-going content area assessments translated  into the home languages of their ELLs whenever it is possible.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At IS 61, teachers and administration are constantly monitoring all services and resources provided to ELLs to ensure they  correspond to the ELLs' ages and grade levels. Newly admitted ELLs are placed according to their age and academic history in  their countries. The ENL curriculum developed by our ENL department is divided into grade levels and all its materials and  assessments  have been reviewed by qualified personnel to correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.    To support ELLs IS 61 teachers use content area curricula fully aligned with the CCLS. Curriculum planning teams in each  content area have been developing their curricula for the past four years and are constantly revising them to ensure that they  contain all essential instructional elements and materials that are grade/level appropriate and linguistically challenging to  promote language development. When making decisions on purchasing instructional materials or discussing in-house  developed materials, curriculum planning teams and department supervisors review them and make sure that those  materials present knowledge and skills that are neither too advanced nor too rudimentary. In alignment with CCLS, our  teachers sequence learning and instruction based on students' age/grade and the skills and knowledge they have acquired in  previous grades to avoid the inadvertent repetition of material that was taught in earlier grades.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    n/a     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELLs have an opportunity and are given priority to enroll in the ELL  Enrichment Summer program if funding is available. During the school year, the academic progress and socio-emotional needs  of newly enroled ELLs are monitored bytheir ENL teacher and the guidance counselor of their academy. Newly enrolled ELLs  participate in all day-time activities along with other students in their classes and in the building, such as talent, advisory,  academy assemblies, class trips, etc. They are also invited to enroll into Title III after-school programs. All newly enrolled ELLs  are also provided with free bilingual dictionaries.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELL at the Expanding and Commanding levels of English language proficiency are offered a foreign language course in Spanish.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   IS 61 has been implementing a Spanish/English Dual Language Program since the beginning of the 2010- 2011 school year. Currently, we have one Dual Language class in 6th grade and one in 8th   grade.  Our  Dual Language classes contains both English Proficient students and English Language Learners. They are  self-contained classes: ELLs and EPs spend all their instructional time together. Teachers licensed in  Spanish bilingual education have been assigned to deliver content instruction.  Of the four major subject  areas, ELA and Science are taught exclusively in English. The Social Studies class is taught by a team of  two teachers: one delivers instruction exclusively in English and the other teacher delivers the instruction  exclusively in Spanish. The Math teacher alternates the two language of instruction on a daily basis. All  content teachers support their instruction by providing students with reading materials/documents in  both languages. Home language and English language supports are given for clear content delivery.  Our students in the DL program due to their age (11-13) and academic background (at least 4 years of  elementary school) are far beyond the stage of emergent literacy in both languages. At IS 61, they  are focused on developing their academic language simultaneously in English and Spanish.  We are constantly in the process of review and revision of this program. In our continuing effort to  improve the program, we will be visiting middle schools that have successful dual language programs.            Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         All ELL personnel including ELL teachers and non-pedagogic staff participates in school-wide professional development  sessions along with content area teachers. These sessions take place every Monday and Tuesday from 7:50am to 8:30am. They  are conducted by qualified personnel in an inquiry format. As per CR Part 154, 15% of all professional development for all  teachers at IS 61 is dedicated to language acquisition.   All ENL and HLA teachers also meet once a week for 45 minutes during a common planning session to discuss and share  effective teaching strategies, revise and update the curriculum and instructional materials, receive guidance and updates on  state and district regulations regarding ENL and bilingual services. As per CR Part 154, 50% of all professional development for  ENL teachers is focused on language acquisition.  Along with the mandated in-house professional development focused on language acquisition, teachers of ELLs including ENL  and bilingual teachers are encouraged to participate in various professional development opportunities provided by the NYC  DOE on the Office of ELLs website. Staff is periodically informed of the available PD sessions by our ELL coordinator.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   IS 61 provides targeted professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs  of English language learners. As per CR Part 154, a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional  development hours for all teachers will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and ENL  teachers, a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners.    The agendas and attendance sheets with signatures of the teachers participating in such professional development will be  kept by the administration accessible for audit and review.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Along with DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences, IS 61 provides at least two annual meetings with parents of ELLs.  During the meeting conducted at the beginning of each school year qualified staff which includes ELL Coordinator, Parent  Coordinator, ENL and bilingual teachers present and explain goals of all three programs: TBE, DL, and ENL, language  development progress of ELLs in general, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all  content areas. During this meeting, parents of ELLs are actively encouraged to support their children's learning at home by  monitoring their reading time in English and in their home language, and by providing their children with time and space to  focus on completion of their homework assignments.   The other meeting with the parents of ELLs is conducted in March of each school year and is dedicated solely to the upcoming  exams and the NYSESLAT in particular. Parents are presented with a short description of the NYSESLAT format and they may  view sample tasks in each language modality tested on the NYSESLAT.  The interpretation is provided by staff proficient in parents' preferred languages as needed. All efforts are made to ensure that  the handouts are translated into parents' preferred language too. The agendas, copies of materials presented, and attendance  sheets with signatures of the parents and school staff participating in such meetings are kept by the ELL Coordinator and  Parent Coordinator accessible for audit and review.    Our school's ELL Coordinator is also available to meet with interested parents on individual basis to discuss any of the above- mentioned topics anytime during the school day. All teachers od ELLs are available to meet with individual parents every  Wednesday from 8am to 8:35am.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         We will continue engaging parents of ELLs into supporting their children's learning through the PupilPath. At the beginning of  the school year, letters are sent home with detailed explanation of how to access this program and how to use it. Parents are  encouraged to track their children's academic performance and progress in individual courses and communicate with teachers.  Our school in collaboration with the PTA has set up a separate room with two desktop computers exclusively for parents to use  during the school day. Parent Coordinator and a designated ENL teacher help parents access their accounts on PupilPath.   The PTA leadership meets with the SLT (School Leadership Team) on a monthly basis to discuss the needs of students, their  parents, and staff. One of the staff representatives on this team is an ENL teacher.   Our school's Parent Coordinator conducts monthly workshops for parents on various topics. The agenda for each workshop  always includes a question addressing the needs of ELLs and their parents. To reinforce the life skills and 7 Habits of Effective  Teens our  students learn in their advisory sessions, the Parent Coordinator also meets with parents on a weekly basis to  discuss these skills and habit. This school year, IS 61 has partnered with the Learning Leaders Volunteer Program to provide  parents of 8  th   graders with a series of workshops to help them about the process of applying to high school in NYC.   Our Parent Coordinator also assists parents in making appointment to receive their NYC ID on a daily basis as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joseph J Lisa, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Leonardo da Vinci                                                                              School DBN: 24Q061  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in their preferred language, I.S.61  utilizes a variety of methods in order to assess the school’s needs in terms of translation. First of all, a CEP review  is conducted, and lines of communication are open between the Parent Coordinator, parents, and administrators,  regarding parent needs and information that needs to be shared. This is done primarily through the School  Leadership Team and the Parent Association.   In order to assess the school's written and oral interpretation needs, the RAPL and RHLA on ATS is generated, and  then a time line is created in order to establish a steady flow of parental communication and determine cost  factors for such translations. Part III of the HLIS and Student Emergency Contact cards are also used to identify  language preferences of the parent community. From there, proficient translators are sought after within the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      building via analysis of a school-wide language survey. The names of those translators are clearly posted in the  main and admission offices for easy access. In order to communicate messages about important school functions,  a school messaging system is in place that automatically calls each child’s home and leaves a message in the  child’s home language, if that language is Spanish.   IS 61 also utilizes the Department of Education letters home in multiple languages to communicate information  and the DOE translation service for school-created memos to be translated into the home languages of the  students.   Lastly, to assess the language needs, several parents will be selected at random during Parent-Teacher  Conferences and other such events. These parents will be surveyed about their particular language needs, which  will then be used to help refine existing translation services in the building.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
