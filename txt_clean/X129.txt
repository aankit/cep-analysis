This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Mission :    Section 4: CEP Overview      Our ultimate goal at MS 129 is to instill confidence in our students and assist them in becoming independent learners  while fostering personal growth in emotional health, social abilities, and academic strengths. We will effectively  prepare our students for college and careers by promoting personal leadership abilities and skills to assist them in  becoming lifelong learners.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      School Vision :    All students will graduate High School and pursue college, trade school, or enter solid careers because we have  instilled clear and strong educational values in them. Our students will grow up to be leaders and respectful members  of society that understand what it takes to succeed in life.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Core Values :   Respect: We take responsibility for our actions and value professionalism. Staff and students are treated with respect  which in turn will help our students grow into respectful adults.   Excellence: We believe that all of our students can achieve at high levels. We are accountable to ensure that they are  given all tools necessary for this to happen.   Peace: We are committed to using conflict resolution strategies to help students avoid violent or disrespectful  encounters to better deal with life’s issues.

As per the 2016-2017 NYC Quality Snapshot, MS 129 was rated “Excellent” for improvement on the State English Test  and for improvement on the State Mathematics Test. MS 129 received either an "excellent" or "good" for all other  groups including Student With Disabilities, English Language Learners, Lowest Performing, and General Education  Students. Current state performance in ELA has increased to 25% proficiency while math has grown to 18%  proficiency.      We are currently rated as a school in “Good Standing” as per New York State.      We have received a “Well Developed" rating on numerous Quality Review sub indicators:   *1.3 Make strategic organizational decisions to support the school's instructional goals.   *1.4 Maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of  students and adults   *2.2 Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on  student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.   *3.4 Establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provide  supports to achieve those expectations.   *4.1 Observe teachers using Danielson Framework for Teaching along with analysis of learning outcomes.      M.S. 129 placed 3rd overall in the Bronx in the "Mathcounts Annual Competition" and were invited to compete in  Albany at the state finals.       We have established an extremely strong athletics programming at MS 129. Our girls' basketball team won 2nd place  in the city championship, our co-ed rugby team claimed the Bronx Championship trophy in 2016, and our co-ed  wresting team has an array of wrestlers that have won at the state level over the past 3 years.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         Challenges:    On June 26th, the principal's MOLP 2017-2018 Review was received and stated that the area of most needed  improvement was indicator 2.2 assessment. This indicator received a rating of "proficient". The recommendations  were to continue adding effective feedback to all student work to ensure a clear understanding by the students of  their next steps. Students should also be pushed to more thoroughly understand the Teachers College Writing  Pathways rubric. Next Steps: An array of professional development resources from D12-NTC Mentoring Program will  be utilized as well as tools received during monthly principals' meetings to strengthen assessment and the effective  use of feedback.. We will also identify highly effective teachers and link them up with developing staff as coaches to  further strengthen pedagogical understanding of assessing students and the use of rubrics.    Student attendance continues to be an issue as the final student attendance for the school year was 91.8%.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Student population: MS 129 consists of approximately 550 students. 20% of our students are ENL and approximately  37% of our students receive special education services. We are a title I school in which 99% of our students receive  free or reduced lunch and 20% of our students live in temporary housing.   The overall attendance of the students living in the local shelters is approximately 5% below that of our non-shelter  students. This lack of attendance greatly effects students’ success rates.      4.

Strengths :   ● The 2016-2017 Quality Review Report stated (related to rigor) that: The school’s belief system of aligning curriculum  and challenging all learners is the foundation for instructional practices across classrooms that foster multiple entry  points, engaging tasks, and high quality student work products.      ● The 2017-2018 quality Guide states that M.S. 129 received a rating of "Exceeding Target" in the area of rigorous  instruction.   ●The 2016-2017 Middle School Quality Snapshot revealed: M.S. 129 was closing the achievement gap. The school was  rated "excellent" in improvement related to ENL, Students with Special Needs, and lowest performing students on the  ELA State Exam. The school was also rated "good" or "excellent" in improvement related to ENL, Students with Special  Needs, and the lowest performing students on the Mathematics State Exam.   Needs :    The March 6th, 2017 PPO revealed the following:       It was recommended that cooperative group learning become a focus to ensure that high levels of student  thinking and discussions are ongoing and promoting rigorous learning.    It was recommended that all follow up observations should carefully monitor next steps that were given to teachers  to ensure that there is classroom evidence of these changes.   The 2016-2017 Middle School Quality Snapshot revealed:   In the area of rigor the snapshot stated that only 74% of teachers at MS 129 claimed that their students build on one  another's ideas during class discussions while the city average was considerably higher at 68%. This is an improvement  from the 2105-2016 snapshot in which only 58% of teachers made the same claim.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths :   The January 2017 “Quality Review” findings showed that MS 129 was rated "proficient" in QR category 4.2.    The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide stated that 99% of MS 129 teachers say that they work together to design  instructional programs compared to an 90% NYC average. Also, 85% of MS 129 teachers say that they receive quality  professional development in their school compared to the 78% NYC average.    The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide rated M.S. 129 as "exceeding targets" in the area of Collaborative Teachers.    Needs :   The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide findings showed that only 81% of staff use innovation and collective  responsibility when lesson planning and designing units of study. Although the percentage (81%) was higher than the  city average of 79%, it was the lowest indicator for M.S. 129 in the area of Collaborative Teachers.    The NYC School Survey provided statistics that stated that only 78% of staff believe that teachers take responsibility  for improving the school and only 60% claim that they are willing to try new ideas.

These  binders will be shared with parents during parent-teacher  conferencing in the form of "student led" parent  conferencing.      Parents will actively participate as their child discusses their  assessment binder and explains next steps. We ask that  parents help their child at home by monitoring their work  habits to ensure the next steps are occurring to foster growth  and success. Parent involvement at home will ultimately lead  to a successful binder.    Misconceptions identified during the 2017-2018 school year  will be implemented and visual in 2018-2019 units of study.

Strengths :   The January 2017 Quality Review rated MS 129 with a "proficient" in QR area 5.1. Also, a rating of "well Developed"  was given as "the principal has made strategic decisions to promote instructional goals and to meet student needs".   The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide revealed the following:    *98% of the teachers agreed that the principal has instructional leadership.   *99% of parents agreed that their is "inclusive principal leadership".   *98% of teachers and 100% of parents claim that they trust the principal.   The 2017-2018 Quality Guide rated M.S. 129 as "exceeding standards" in the area of Effective School Leadership.    Needs :   2017-2018 PPO indicates that "the principal has a clear vision of common beliefs about how students learn best, but  does not have the staff fully aligned to those same beliefs" as these beliefs were only visible in some classrooms  observed.   2017-2018 PPO also indicated that administration was behind "suggested" observation completion deadlines  regarding formal and informal observations numerous times throughout the school year. The only missed deadline  should be the first round as M.S. 129 administration does not begin formal or informal observations until October 1 to  allow the teachers time to meet and better understand their students.                        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  1. We have partnered with Dr. Wermuth and Dr. Farber from The Mercy College Education Department. They will be  forwarding the resumes of graduating students who are interested in working at MS 129 in attempt to recruit new  teachers that meet our "HQ" needs. We have also combined forces with NYC Teach. NYC Teach will be sending 20  Teaching Fellows to MS 129 during the 2018 summer to work with summer school students.    2. Teacher grade leaders will participate in the hiring process for candidates who will work in our school. This ensures  that candidates are aware of the school’s team-based philosophy and that they are a good fit for the group of  professionals with whom they will most often be working. This will assist in overall teacher retention. Teacher grade  leaders will participate in interviewing to focus on hiring "HQ" candidates, they will serve as hiring committee chairs.  They will conduct informal lunches or meetings with finalist candidates.    3. New teachers are paired with a mentor teacher from their grade/subject level team for a minimum of one year.  This mentor process, not only helps incorporate the new teacher into the school, but also quickly indoctrinates them  into the grade/subject-level team culture. We also offer a new teacher workshop hosted by Asst. Principal Sharon  Davis and NTC Mentor Andrew Mathison. Teachers can ask any questions that they may have and also receive PD  related to classroom routine and structure. All new staff receive a “PRIM” book to assist them in classroom  management. All aforementioned items will help teachers feel "at home" at M.S. 129, therefore increasing year to  year retention.    4. The New Teacher Center: Through our mentoring program (Mr. Mathison, mentor), our new teachers will  effectively engage in rigorous mentoring and instructional development. New teachers will receive a minimum of 90  minutes of mentoring per week during the 2018-2019 school year.   5. Grade/subject level teams meet to discuss developmental needs and share these directly with the principal or  other instructional leader who sits in on team meetings. Appropriate professional development and training will be  provided during our Monday extended day professional development time from 2:30pm-3:35pm.    6. Inter-visitations and learning walks will take place throughout the year to observe best practices and to learn from  one another. We will also be visiting other middle schools (Kappa III) to view best practices to promote retention.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      7. To ensure that all staff are highly qualified, we have a plan in place in which any staff member will be given the  opportunity to attend 3 professional developments of their choice during the 2018-2019 school year.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   1. Beginning in September, administration will create professional development plans to discuss and review the key 8  components of the Danielson rubric.   2. To encourage professional growth we will form a Professional Development committee to brainstorm ideas for  quality professional development. We will survey the staff to see what their preferences are. We will then create a  professional development calendar for our eighty minute professional development period on Monday.    3. We will encourage inter-classroom visitations with colleagues.    4. We will allocate money for outside professional development and for our teachers to attend up to 3 outside PD's to  further their education.   5. Generation Ready professionals will be providing professional development to staff one time per month during our  Monday afternoon 75 minute PD sessions.      6. Assistant Principal Davis will be in charge of all professional development for the 2017-2018 school year.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  *         3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  *                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Not Applicable        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     1. During common planning meetings, the teachers make the decisions on how to effectively use math data to  promote growth and ELA data to push key strategies during their guided reading practice and independent  conferencing.   2. Teachers will meet three times per week for common planning/subject/grade meetings to discuss academic  assessments and evaluation of our strategies and activities.   3. SIT (School Implementation team) will meet with teachers to discuss possible mainstreaming of special education  students after reviewing their data.   4. With the support of our Literacy Specialist our teachers are directly involved in the creation of all their units in  literacy. With the support of the Math AP our teachers refine the assessments that are including in our Math  Curriculum. Our teachers design their own units and assessments for Social Studies and Science. Our cluster teachers  design their own units and assessments in art, dance, music, home and career studies, etc.).         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. MS 129 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.

With the supplemental program, we want to ensure that the programs are tailored to students  specific needs based on the ENL subgroups.    The supplemental programs being used are: Achieve 3000, Rosetta Stone, and Welcome  Newcomers Saddleback Kit, Decode: Action Packed Books for Teens    a. The instructional plan for SIFEs is to develop oral proficiency and comprehension  strategies.  Comprehension strategies need to be explicitly taught to students with interrupted  formal education, such as: reader generated question, summarizing and monitoring  comprehension.   Students practice with texts that are accessible at their level of language proficiency.  If students  don’t experience successful application of comprehension strategies, they won’t try to use them  in other texts. Strategies that make the language of the text meaningful and progress to higher  levels of language proficiency and reading comprehension for students are: sharing ideas,  comparing perspectives, coming to agreement (or agreeing to disagree).  During school and after school and Saturday programs) literacy and math instruction is based on  item analysis data from informal classroom diagnostic and school based exams, such as the  predictive assessment and the ITA assessments.    We will be using Decode: Action Packed Books for Teens  SIFE grade level is 6th to 8th grade. These students will use the Decode Action packed Books  during Saturday Academy.  Schedule and duration: Saturday Academy from 9:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m. The program will  begin mid to end of October and run through mid-May. (For approximately 12 sessions)  Language of Instruction: English  Teachers: One certified ENL teacher  # of students: Approximately 7    b. The instructional plan for ENLs with less than three years is to develop comprehension and  basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS). ENLs in the pre-production and early  production stages of language acquisition are engaged in experiences and activities that involve  listening (known as the silent period for some ENLs) mime, acting, pointing, drawing, selecting,  categorizing, responding etc. Entering and Emerging ENLs meet for at least 360 minutes per  week.      Instructional strategies for ELLS with 0-3 years are: graphic organizers, games, Language  Experience Approach, Total Physical Response, manipulatives and visuals, choral reading and  the buddy system.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   The materials that are used include: 0-3 years: Words Their Way, ESL Phonics Word to Word  Dictionaries, Brain-Pop, Starfall.com, Getting Ready for NYSESLAT and Beyond, Word to  word bilingual dictionaries, month by month phonics.

The instructional plan for ELLs with 4-6 years is to further develop cognitive academic  language proficiency (CALP) and speech emergence.  Students engage in experiences and  activities that include recalling, summarizing, role-playing, predicting, creating, analyzing,  comparing, contrasting etc.    Advanced ELLs meet for 180 minutes per week. The instructional plan for advanced ELLs is  continued support in language development and comprehension.  The instructional strategies for ELLs with 4-6 years are: Cooperative Learning, graphic  organizers, manipulatives, visuals, journals, hands on projects, choral reading etc.  The materials that are used for 4-6 years include: Words, Their Way, Reader’s Theatre: William  Shakespeare, Reader’s Theatre: Early America, Writing Workshop by Sadlier , Grammar  Workshop by Sadlier-Oxford, Empire State NYSESLAT, Getty Ready for NYSESLAT  and  Beyond, Word to Word bilingual dictionaries, Brain Pop    The program being used for this subgroup is Achieve 3000.

Some are invited for a test prep  program after school three days per week.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Five times during the school year there will be a PD on Mondays from 2:30-3:30pm for ALL  staff including the guidance counselor, school psychologist, paraprofessionals, etc. on ENL  methodologies conducted by an outside source or ENL teachers.  The assistant principal will attend monthly ENL PD's.    The ENL teachers as well as content area teachers who teach the ENL population will attend  monthly ENL PD's. In the 2017-2018 school year, the ENl teacher as well as the ELA content  area teacher and the assistant principal have attended a series of ENL PD’s every month-District  12 Chancellor’s Innovation Grant ENL Workshop Series)  As more PD's become available, ENL  teachers will be attending and turn keying the information to the staff. Agendas will be kept on  file in the compliance binder and in teachers folders to keep trach of hours.  This activity will be  extended to the SY 2018-19.    The following professional development is offered to teachers of ENLs (including ENL and  bilingual teachers in supporting ENLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards:  o             In-School PD via grade meetings and faculty conferences:             NYSESLAT Modality Analysis & Instructional Next Steps     Follow up and on-going PD is planned on:              ENL data analysis and its implication for instructional planning             ENL Strategies   These PD’s are conducted by our ENL teachers and content area teachers who teach our ENL  students.    o             Outside School PD  Topics presented:              Revisiting ENLs:  Shadowing Listening & Speaking             Common Core Learning Standards             Math Institute for Secondary Teachers of ENLs               As professional development is offered from various bilingual/ENL organizations, it is  shared with our ENL/Bilingual teaching staff to further assist our ENL population.    As part of our school initiative, we have implemented and have a full focus on college and career  readiness. Teachers are trained to provide students with the necessary tools needed to move on to  the next level. Three times a week students have an advisory period where the homeroom  teacher, guidance counselor and the deans have discussions with students about the following  topics:    o             Selection criteria for potential high schools with the students and teachers  o             Individual student review of grades, conduct, etc. in selecting high schools.  o             Application process and assistance in completing the forms   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Part C: Professional Development   o             Scheduling of Student/Parent High School orientation  o             Student Expectations/Questions/Anxieties    We also have an ENL advisory at least 3 times a year which we began to implement this year.  We also have a "Moving Up Ceremony" Students are recognized for their efforts in ENL and for  moving up a proficiency level or testing out of NYSESLAT.    Teachers also provide students with goal sheets in the beginning of the school year where ENL  students must come up with a NYSELSAT goals based on last year’s NYSESLAT scores and  they also come up with an action plan to achieve that goal. Providing students with all of this and  letting them know where they are as ENL students, gives them a head start as to where they need  to be in order to prepare for high school.    The assistant principal periodically sends ENL PD emails to all staff that they can choose to  attend which must be approved by the principal. Staff must then turnkey the information during  our Monday PD's. The ENL teachers provide ongoing PD's on Mondays for all staff. On  Thursdays, for one hour, the ENL and bilingual teachers meet, as well as the content ELA  teacher and the assistant principal to discuss ENL related matters and to turn key information to  each other. Agendas of all PDs are kept in the compliance binder and a folder with each teachers  name and all PDs attended are kept in each individual folder to tract hours completed.

A translator will be provided as needed. Each  teacher of ELL students will have a binder to keep a phone/meeting log with the date,  time,  name of parent, type of meeting every time the parent is contacted or met with to discuss  child’s progress.  ENL teachers also invite parents in for One-on One meeting. During these meetings, teachers  discuss goals of the ENL program, child’s language development progress, English Language  Proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Teachers  keep an agenda and a sign in sheet for each individual meeting. Parents are also provided with  the Bill of Rights for NYS English Language Learners.    The school will provide assistance to parents of children served by the school, as appropriate, in  understanding topics such as the following:     The Common Core Learning Standards, the State and local academic assessments including  alternate assessments, how to monitor their child’s progress, and how to work with educators and  the new ELL modalities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    The school provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve  their children’s academic achievement, such as literacy training, and using technology  The school  fosters parental involvement by providing parents with the opportunity to attend  Rosetta Stone classes and GED classes.  Monthly website letter updates, weekly school wide parent telephone calls in Spanish and  English, letters that are mailed home regarding student NYSESLAT scores, NYSESLAT testing,  entitlement letters, school wide activities etc. A monthly calendar in English and Spanish are also  sent home. Two meetings a year are scheduled for parents of ELL students.    We have annual parent conferences for parents of ENL’s. The first one will take place in March  2019: Annual Conference for Parents of ELLs: Discover your rights. Learn about your child’s  Language Success at MS 129.  In January 2019 we will have another parent workshop: ENL Workshop for Parents…This  workshop is aimed at exploring ways to assist students with academic achievement. Parents  explored techniques to guide independent reading at home.    The school builds ties between parents and schools through parent meetings, parent  communication with the Parent Coordinator, School Leadership Team communication, and email  communication.  The school will, to the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrates parental  involvement programs such as parent resource centers that encourage and support parents, parent  workshops for high school selection and transition.    The school will take the following actions to ensure that important information (programs,  meetings, activities) is sent to the parents of participating children in an understandable and  uniform format, including alternative formats upon request, and, to the extent practicable, in a  language the parents can understand: Monthly translated letters updating school information,  weekly translated school wide telephone calls and updated website information.    The school evaluates the needs of parents through the phone/meeting outreach to parents. Not  only do teachers discuss the child’s progress but they also discuss parent needs and concerns  which in turn are related to the assistant principal in charge of the ELL department. Parents also  take the school surveys in their native language which also gives us an insight on parent’s needs  Teachers discuss with the parent a beginning of year survey.    Most of our parents speak Spanish. Many parents of ELL students feel uncomfortable already  because they have a language barrier and so they get intimidated asking questions or finding out  information about their child's education. Our role is to ensure that all parents feel comfortable  enough to be able to be involved in their child's education. Parental involvement is crucial in  ensuring that parents do not miss out on services that will help them and their child.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We are currently using Fontas and Pinnell. Teachers conduct running records twice a year and conduct guided reading groups  once a week with students. Running records examine both accuracy and types of errors made. It determines next instructional  steps for each child. We evaluate the students literacy skills through running records and various teacher created materials.  For the ELLs that have taken the ELA exam we evaluate the exam results to determine student levels as well. We use the data  from the NYSITELL, I-Ready, Performance Series, ELA Scores and NYSESLAT to also help determine the students' strengths and  weaknesses.  We have learned from the review of our data that our ELL students have a strength in Speaking and Reading skills  and a weakness in Listening and writing skills. Focus is placed on Listening and writing skills within all classrooms to  concentrate on improving those skills.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      The ELL teachers will combine students’ informal assessments with standardized data to measure individual progress and help  drive instruction.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ENL teachers meet twice a week to discuss data and to use the data from these assessments to help them drive instruction  and help them implement different strategies into units/curriculum.  The ENL teachers also meet with ELA/Math teachers  during weekly subject area meetings to make informed decisions on the implementation of ENL strategies and content specific  strategies and methodologies based on what ELA/Math teacher is teaching in the unit.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Reviewing and discussing the EDAT criteria helps our school understand how and why our ELLs are progressing or not.  Clarity  in the progress movement helps determine the next course of action action (i.e. planning, teaching practices, support) in order  for growth to occur. On going professional development and faculty conferences on ELL data analysis and ENL practices will  continue throughout the year. The EDAT is a true indicator on how our ELL's are advancing on each modality because  everything is clearly broken down and we can visually see trends across modalities. This helps with planning effectively to  meet the needs of our ELL population.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have various before school and after school tutoring that begins in October until May as well as AIS for our ENL population.  Achieve 3000 is used as a supplemental program for our transitioning and expanding students but we also utilize the program  as extra support during the school day 2 periods a week for grades 7 and 8 ENL students. Rosetta Stone is used before school  for entering students. Rosetta stone is also utilized during the school day as needed for ENL Entering and Emerging students  who need the extra support to improve their English. Parents are invited to attend Rosetta Stone sessions before school with  their child. We also have a NYSESLAT test prep course embedded into the daily schedule for all ENL students. Test prep in  twice a week for 6th 7th and 8th grade ENL students. NYSESLAT test prep is also offered on Saturdays during Saturday  Academy. For the 2017-2018 school year Saturday Academy will begin on September 30th. Once we know what the students  deficiencies are, teachers focus on instruction based on the specific deficiencies. Students receive the mandated ENL minutes  and extra minutes beyond the mandated minutes are provided to those students as well. The ENL students are broken up into  small groups for ELA, Math, social Studies and Science instruction. The instruction is delivered by ENL and subject area  teachers.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL performance indicates a specifically clear deficiency in the listening modality. This in turn affects the speaking,  reading and writing modalities.  The students are not meeting the benchmarks for each of the modalities. These deficiency  patterns in the listening modality are also seen in the NYSESLAT results. Students with limited English tend to fail the Listening  modality more than their English peers.   We also noticed that we tend to have many expanding students in each grade. We currently have 13 expanding 6  th   grade  students, 16 expanding 7  th   grade students, and 5 expanding 8  th   grade students.   The data reveals that a push with the expanding students is crucial to ensure that they test out. Looking carefully at each  modality and what students are lacking is also very important for teachers to be able to pin point the deficiency and be able to  fix it.       .     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         First wetake a look at the EDAT data to give us a view on student performance on the NYSESLAT. Once we aggregate the data,  students are then programmed based on scores on NYSESLAT and  are provided with the mandated ENL minutes required as  per CR Part 154. Once we determine the outcome of the assessments, the assistant principal in charge of the ENL  department meets with the ENL teachers first with copies of the data. Teachers and administrators sit and discuss the findings  along with next steps. ENL teachers then disseminate the information to all staff in the building. Everyone receives a copy of all  ENL students in the building, their NYSESLAT scores, the findings etc. We use the EDAT to identify trends within the last 3  years. We determine what modality is the area in need of improvement based on how many students in the school failed that  specific modality and we focus and put emphasis on that modality during NYSESLAT test prep and during ELA throughout the  school year. Students who continue to not show improvement and stay in same proficiency level, we offer them the  supplemental programs available.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We currently began an ENL small school in our building. All of our ENL students with the exception of those ENL  students in ICT and special education classes are self contained. We currently have a 6th and 7th bridged ENL class  with approximately 30 students. We also have an 8th grade ENL class consisting of approximately 29-30 students.  Students who receive stand alone ENL services(Entering, emerging, and some transitioning students) are pulled out  for the mandated minutes by an ENL teacher for services. During the integrated portion of the Freestanding ENL  program, there is an ELA with bilingual license teacher who teaches 6 and  7th grade bridged class ELA. We have an  ENL science teacher who teaches the 6th/7th grade bridged class 3 times a week. We have 2 math teachers with  bilingual license. One teacher teaches 6th grade math and the other teaches 7th grade math. For social studies we  have a common branch teacher with bilingual license teaching 6th and 7th grade bridged class.   The 8th grade ENL class has an ELA teacher with ENL certification teaching 7 periods a week. The math teacher has a  bilingual license and teaches the 8th grade class 6 periods a week. The science teacher has an ENL certification and  teaches the 8thgrade class 3 times per week.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.       N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               In the beginning of the school year, Mrs. Rodriguez ensures that all ENL students are placed together in a few  classrooms and not scattered within a grade so that programming is easier in order to ensure that the mandated number of  minutes are provided.   We use an integrated approach for the most part and entering students receive integrated and stand alone ENL services.  Entering students receive 360 minutes per week of ENL services (4 periods per week or more of integrated into social studies  and science classroom and 4 periods per week of stand alone for ENL methodologies). Emerging students receive 360 minutes  per week of ENL service (2 periods per week of stand alone  ENL and 6 periods per week or more of integrated ENL into social  studies and science classroom).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Transitioning students receive 180 minutes (4 periods per week) of integrated ENL in social studies and science classroom.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes(4 periods per week) integrated ENL in science and social studies classroom.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL services into ELA, social studies or science classroom.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Paste response here:        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       The ELLS are tested in the Examen de la Lectura en Espanol (ELE) and they receive interim assessments specifically for the  ELLs by Acuity. Study groups for ELLs will be created to ensure that these students have a clear understanding of the concepts  that are being taught on a daily basis.  Support groups for the newly arrived students will be formed in order to make a smooth  transition into the school system, and these groups will focus on developing strategies that students can use to increase their  academic achievement.      In addition to the regular instructional programs used in different content areas (e.g. balanced literacy approach, Math, Urban  Advantage for science, etc.), using the Point-of-Entry Model of instructional planning. Students also participate in Saturday  Academy. There is a wide range of materials and resources that are available in the classrooms, including a well equipped  library that contains varied genres in different levels of readability, textbooks, workbooks, and computers/laptops to aid the  students in the learning process. Rosetta Stone and Achieve 3000 are used by the ELL students before and after school. Data  derived from the programs help us track student progress.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. The instructional plan for SIFEs is to develop oral proficiency and comprehension strategies.  Comprehension strategies need  to be explicitly taught to students with interrupted formal education, such as: reader generated question, summarizing and  monitoring comprehension.    Students practice with texts that are accessible at their level of language proficiency.  If students don’t experience successful  application of comprehension strategies, they won’t try to use them in other texts. Strategies that make the language of the  text meaningful and progress to higher levels of language proficiency and reading comprehension for students are: sharing  ideas, comparing perspectives, coming to agreement (or agreeing to disagree).   During school and after school and Saturday programs) literacy and math instruction is based on item analysis data from  informal classroom diagnostic and school based exams, such as the predictive assessment and the ITA assessments.     b. The instructional plan for ELLs with less than three years is to develop comprehension and basic interpersonal  communication skills (BICS). ELLs in the pre-production and early production stages of language acquisition are engaged in  experiences and activities that involve listening (known as the silent period for some ELLs) mime, acting, pointing, drawing,  selecting, categorizing, responding etc. Beginning and intermediate ELL's meet for at least 360 minutes per week.       Instructional strategies for ELLS with 0-3 years are: graphic organizers, games, Language Experience Approach, Total Physical  Response, manipulative and visuals, choral reading and the buddy system.   The materials that are used include: 0-3 years: Words Their Way, ENL Phonics Word to Word Dictionaries, Brain-Pop,  Starfall.com, Getting Ready for NYSESLAT and Beyond, Word to word bilingual dictionaries, month by month phonics. These  students also have the opportunity to attend after school using Rosetta Stone.  c.The instructional plan for ELLs with 4-6 years is to further develop cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) and  speech emergence.  Students engage in experiences and activities that include recalling, summarizing, role-playing, predicting,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      creating, analyzing, comparing, contrasting etc.     Advanced ELLs meet for 180 minutes per week. The instructional plan for advanced ELLs is continued support in language  development and comprehension.  The instructional strategies for ELLs with 4-6 years are: Cooperative Learning, graphic organizers, manipulative, visuals,  journals, hands on projects, choral reading etc.  The materials that are used for 4-6 years include: Words, Their Way, Reader’s Theatre: William Shakespeare, Reader’s Theatre:  Early America, Writing Workshop by Sadlier , Grammar Workshop by Sadlier-Oxford, Empire State NYSESLAT, Getty Ready for  NYSESLAT  and Beyond, Word to Word bilingual dictionaries, BrainPop  The school ensures that the ELLs-swds receive all service mandated on their IEPs via the articulation logs, bimonthly  attendance and presentations at grade conferences.  The Assistant Principal is in charge of Special Education and is the Coordinator of Mainstreaming.  Mainstreaming occurs 5  periods weekly in literacy and math for students that have this noted on their IEPs. Through appropriate scheduling, the  Principal provides time for regular meetings between regular and special education teachers. Students are offered an after  school program called Achieve 3000.                d.The materials that are ued for ELLs who have completed 6+ years include: Wrting Workshop by Sadlier, Grammar  Workshop by Sadlier-Oxford, Getting Ready for NYSESLAT and Beyond, 6+1 Traits of Writing, Empire State NYSESLAT, Word to  word bilingual dictionaries, Reader’s Theatre: William Shakespeare, Reader’s Theatre: Early America.      Entering and Emerging student are offered Rosetta Stone after school.  Transitioning and Expanding students are offered Achieve 3000, Language Power, Saturday Academy and NYSESLAT Test Prep  after school.  Commanding Students are offered Saturday Academy.  e.Former ELLs receive two periods a week of Push In services provided by an ENL teacher. They receive testing  accommodations for an additional two years(extended time on teacher created tests as well as all state tests) and continue to  use glossaries and dictionaries. these students are offered all of the after school programs listed above as well as Saturday  Academy.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use a lot of visuals and hands on activities fro their ELL students. They constantly activate prior knowledge when  introducing a new topic. A lot of scaffolding is used in the classroom to ensure that ELL students master skills taught. Graphic  organizers, vocabulary strategies, Fryers model, cooperative learning groups, differentiation, shared reading are  guided  reading and strategy groups to build on language acquisition. Picture walks, a lot of modeling, dictionaries and glossaries, the  use of technology, think alouds, reciprocal teaching are all used by the bilingual and ELL teachers.  Teachers of ELL students use  think pair share strategies, literature circles, parallel teaching, peer teaching, and complementary teaching throughout the day.  Materials used by the teacher are Fontas and Pinell leveld text in English and Spanish, Rosetta Stone, Achieve 3000, gra[phic  organizers, audio tapes with headphones, etc to help accelerate English Language Development.       For ELL students with disabilities, differentiated activities are provided based on the baseline assessment, Spring NYSESLAT  scores, periodic assessments and needs outlined in the student IEP. After reviewing test scores and IEP mandates, students are  placed in the class setting with supports outlined in their IEPS. Students are also part of the ESL pull-out/ Integrated program,  receiving services in accordance with test results and their IEPs. Special education and the ESL teachers collaborate monthly to  determine the short term academic and lingual goals for each ELL student with special needs, as these evaluations should be  progressive and open to change, as per the student’s individual education plan. Differentiated lessons will be tailored in order  to meet the academic needs of these students. Teaching strategies to facilitate the ELL-SWD students include small group  instruction that emphasizes peer group work. The ESL teacher will incorporate different ways to present the information, for  example, the teacher will provide visual aids or story read alongs on tape to address the visual and auditory learners. Students  will be given differentiated graphic organizers to meet their individual learning needs and styles.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Additional ELL periods are scheduled during the students' "first period" in order to cause a minimun disruption to the students'  academic schedule. The curriculum is adapted to the needs of the indivual student. ELL students with IEP's have programs that  are the least restrictive, such as SETSS classes. All teachers of ELL students collaborate together in order to best serve the  student. Common planning time every Thursday first period with ESL and bilibngual teachers ensures that curriculum is  adjusted to meet the needs of the ELLs. Common planning time is used to further assist our students by discussing the  students' needs with each other. When appropriate, students from special education classes are mainstreamed with students  in general education classes for certain core subjects.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At MS129, we ensure that there are targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, social Studies, Science. All teachers  of ELLs use many approaches to teaching. Some of the approaches include differentiation of instruction (Fontas and Pinell  leveled books,groupings of students based on needs, use of graphic organizers, scafoolding techniques, visuals, multiple entry  points, sentence starters, Rosetta Stone for those students who really do not know the English language and need extra  English support, Achieve 3000 for reading comprehension, Go Math for students struggling with the math curriculum used. The  use of Spanish/English glossaries are availbale for each student in math, social studies and science. We offer AIS small group  instruction for our ELL's once or twice a week.      Those students who come with an IEP from another school and/or were going through CSE reviews prior to attending MS 129  are reviewed to ascertain if the ELL student is struggling with language difficulty or if the student has special needs. Students  are assessed and evaluated on an on-going basis to assure they were appropriately placed.  If an ELL student is suspected of having special needs, it is very important that academic interventions are implemented and  the results recorded before any formal assessment or review is requested. At 129X there is an RTI team in place whose goals  are to maximize individual student success in the regular classroom, while at the same time serving as a screening process for  students who may be in a need of special education services. The team includes the ESL Teacher/Bilingual Teacher, Principal or  designee, members of the School based support team (SAT), guidance counselor.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Parents are now encouraged to attend morning and after school programs with their child. Involving parents in the learning  process will ensure that they are continuously focusing on their child's academic needs and can understand and be able to help  their ELL child in the learning process as well.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We did not have the appropriate number of students who spoke the same language across two grades to open a class.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Title III letter is sent out to parents at the beginning of the school year indicating the services offered to ELL students and their  right to be provided with supplemental services for their child. Currently we offer two programs for ELL students and parents.  Rosetta Stone is offered after school from 2:30-3:30 Wednesday-Friday. Achieve 3000 is offered after school on Wednesday- Friday from 2:30pm until 3:30pm. Students are also offered Saturday Academy services to help prepare them for state exams.  LEAP after school program is offered to all students in the school including ELL's. Parents who wish to sign their child up  receives an application in their native language to fill out. Basketball, Lacrose, running are also offered to all students and the  assistant principal ensures that any activities and programs that are offered in the school is articulated to the parents through  a letter sent home in native language. Project Boost is another program that we offer to  20 high achieving students and the  assistant principal ensures that she includes at least 4 ELL/bilingual students in the program every year.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Graphic organizers, Fryers model, shared reading are all being used in the classroom. Students are provided with primary- language books. Teachers have literacy centers. Teachers use guided reading and strategy groups to build on language  acquisition. Picture walks, a lot of modeling, dictionaries and glossaries, the use of technology(lap tops for each child),think  alouds, reciprocal teaching are all used by ENL teachers.  Other materials include:  Fontas and Pinell leveled text in English and  Spanish, Rosetta Stone, Achieve 3000, Myon, audio tapes with headphones, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT to help accelerate  English Language Development.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We offer Stand alone and integrated ENL services to all ENL students. ENL students at the Entering and Emerging levels are  receiving 360 minutes of Stand alone and Integrated instruction; students at the Transitioning level are receiving 180 minutes  of integrated ENL during Social studies and Science. Expanding ENL students are receiving 90 minutes of integrated ENL  services during social studies and science. Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services.  ENL strategies  are infused through instruction in the content areas, and teachers reinforce the vocabulary development and literacy skills of  ENL by taking into account their proficiency level. In Math students use CMP3 and the bilingual students use Go Math for  support. In ELA, the Units include scaffolding and differentiation tailored to meet the needs of the bilingual students. Some of  the readings are in Spanish and many Library reading books are in Spanish and English.   Language Powers, Getting ready for the NYSESLAT and Guided Reading books as well as Achieve 3000 leveled articles are used  for ENL instruction.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Services, support and resources are delivered based on level that the child is on. Getting ready for the NYSESLAT books are by  grade level. Leveled texts are used based on students reading levels.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Graphic organizers, Fryers model, shared reading are all being used in the classroom. Students are provided with primary- language books. Teachers have literacy centers. Teachers use guided reading and strategy groups to build on language  acquisition. Picture walks, a lot of modeling, dictionaries and glossaries, the use of technology(lap tops for each child),think  alouds, reciprocal teaching are all used by the bilingual and ELL teachers.  Other materials include:  Fontas and Pinell leveled  text in English and Spanish, Rosetta Stone, Achieve 3000, audio tapes with headphones, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT to  help accelerate English Language Development.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We offer Rosetta Stone for all incoming ELL students with limited or no English during the morning from Monday through  Friday from 7:15am until 8:00am. We also offer Saturday Academy beginning in October from 9am-12pm. We offer Achieve  3000, an online program for our emerging and transitioning students to help advance their reading skills. This program is  offered Wednesday through Friday from 2:30-3:30 pm from November until May. When new students come in, we give them a  tour of the school building so that they familiarize themselves with the school and the staff. The staff involved in these  activities include the assistant principal, the ESL teachers, bilingual teachers and the parent coordinator.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We currently have Spanish as a language elective.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   PN/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Five times during the school year there will be a PD on Mondays from 2:30-3:30pm for ALL staff including the guidance  counselor, school psychologist, paraprofessionals, etc. on ELL methodologies conducted by an outside source or ESL teachers.   The assistant principal will attend monthly ELL PD's (the first PD attended was on October 6  th   " A Collaborative and Teaming  Approach to Co-Teaching).   The ESL and bilingual teachers will attend monthly ELL PD's the first one to begin on October 23, 2015, November, 13, 20(Nults  and Bolts for NEW Teachers of Students who are Learning English as a New Language). December 9, 16 (Understanding and  Impacting the Disproportionality of ELL's as Students with Disabilities).

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As part of our school initiative, we have implemented and have a full focus on college and career readiness. Teachers are  trained to provide students with the necessary tools needed to move on to the next level. Three times a week students have  an advisory period where thie homeroom teacher, guidance counselor and the deans have discussions with students about the  following topics:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         o     Selection criteria for potential high schools with the students and teachers  o     Individual student review of grades, conduct etc in selecting high schools.  o     Application process and assistance in completing the forms   o     Scheduling of Student/Parent High School orientation  o     Student Expectations/Questions/Anxieties  We also have an ENL advisory at least 3 times a year which we began to implement this year. The first one is on October 27,  2015 where parents have also been invited to attend. It is called a "Moving Up Ceremony" Students are recognized for their  efforts in ENL and for moving up a proficiency level or testing out of NYSESLAT.   Teachers also give students goal sheets in the beginning of the school year where ENL students must come up with a NYSELSAT  goal based on last years NYSESLAT scores and they also come up with an action plan to achieve that goal. Providing students  with all of this and letting them know where they are as ENL students, gives them a head start as to where they need to be in  order to prepare for high school.            The assistant principal periodically sends ELL PD emails to all staff that they can choose to attend which must be approved by  the principal. Staff must then turn key the information during our Monday PD's. The ENL teachers provide ongoing PD's on  Mondays for all staff. On Thursday's the ENL teachers meet to discuss ENL related matters and to turn key information to each  other. Agendas of all PD's are kept in the compliance binder and a folder with each teachers name and all PD's attended are  kept in each individual folder to tract hours completed. During in house PD's and weekly ENL meetings, minutes are taken by  an ENL teachers as well as a sign in sheet that goes around and then kept in ENL compliance binder.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During the Tuesday parent-outreach period teachers will call parents of ELL students for a minimum of 2 times per year to  discuss language development, how their child is progressing and next steps to help improve student outcomes. A translator  will be provided as needed. Each teacher of ELL students will have a binder to keep a phone/meeting log with the date,  time,  name of parent, type of meeting everytime the parent is contacted or met with to discuss childs progress.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The school will provide assistance to parents of children served by the school, as appropriate, in understanding topics such as  the following:       The Common Core Learning Standards, the State and local academic assessments including alternate assessments, how to  monitor their child’s progress, and how to work with educators and the new ELL modalities.   The school provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children’s academic  achievement, such as literacy training, and using technology   The school  fosters parental involvement by providing parents with the opportunity to attend Rosetta Stone classes and GED  classes.  Monthly website letter updates, weekly school wide parent telephone calls in Spanish and English, letters that are mailed  home regarding student NYSESLAT scores, NYSESLAT testing, entitlement letters, school wide activities etc. A monthly calender  in english and spanish are also sent home. Two meetings a year are scheduled for parents of ELL students.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    When a student enters our school from another country, the ESL teacher interviews the student and the parent. The ESL teacher  then tests the student using the NYSITELL if there's reason to believe that the child requires tot ake the test. Once the results are  in, the ESL teacher sends an ENtitlement letter home with the child and one is mailed out as well in the parents native language.  The ESL teacher conducts a parent orientation in the parents native language so that parents are aware of the programs in our  school. Parents then use the Parent Selection form in their native language to choose the program that best meets the needs of  their child. A placement letter is then given to the parent so that they know where their child wa splaced.  On Tuesdays during teacher phone outreach, bilingual and ESL teachers call parents and document their logs on Skedula an online  program that we use at our school. When ever we meet with parents in person, we keep a log in our compliance binder specifying  the time, date of the meeting. We constantly mail out letters to parents to inform them of their child's NYSESLAT level, meetings  that we would be conducting, professional development meetings for parents etc. All of these letters that we mail out, we also  make a copy of and place the copy in our compliance binder for our records. Agendas of meetings are also kept in the compliance  binder.                            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Raymond Granda, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   MS 129                                                                              School DBN: 12x129  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon entering MS 129, the assistant principal, supervisor of the ELL department takes the required steps as per  CR part 154 in order to ensure equity for all. The first step taken to assess parent language preference is  administering the HLIS to parents of incoming students coming from another country. The HLIS is administered by  a licensed pedagogue (assistant principal or the ELL teacher) The HLIS provides us with information needed to  determine if a child's language is other than English and parents are able to let us know their preferred language  of communication through the HLIS. The oral interview is conducted in the parents preferred language as well.  Our main office pedagogue provide bilingual services to assist our Spanish speaking population with admissions.  They provide parents with admissions forms in their native language. Currently 3 office staff members speak  fluent Spanish. Once complete, the Home Language Survey results are immediately given to our ELL coordinator.  If the student's home language is other than English, they will receive all documentation translated in their home  language.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      Part III of the HLIS has to do with parent information including the language in which they prefer to receive  written and oral information. The HLIS is the record that we use to keep this information and then the OTELE  (Home Language code) code is entered into ATS where it is available for viewing as to parents home language.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The parent surveys are given out to parents every year during parent teacher conferences. To ensure that we receive  at least 90% of surveys back, parents must sign in and go straight to the surveys before seeing teachers. Parents who  complete the surveys also get to choose a book for their child to keep. The parent surveys are given to parents in their  native language and staff members are available to assist parents in filling out the forms. The surveys give us a  glimpse of how the school is doing in terms of services available to parents.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80
