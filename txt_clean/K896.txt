This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) students engage in learning that is authentic, significant, fun, and  incorporates 21st century skills. Through a student-centered inquiry approach to learning, in a relationship-driven  environment, we prepare children to be responsible, resilient, compassionate, and collaborative learners able to  engage at the highest levels of discourse. At S.C.I. we integrate the content areas and provide our students with  enduring understanding and a purposeful application of knowledge. Students will demonstrate future readiness, for  global cultural competency, and perspective.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) has established partnerships with the following organizations and  institutions of higher learning. Partnership creation is ongoing as the school community grows:     Teachers College Reading and Writing Project                    Responsive Classroom      Third Street Music Settlement      The Media Spot      Sunset Spark   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) is a new school in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn the data  we have gathered the following preliminary data.    In our inaugural year we are set to serve 100 kindergarten students. We currently are at 30% enrollment and are  working towards recruitment and expansion.   Our student body is made up 60% Asian students and 34% Hispanic students. English Language Learners comprise  80% of the student population, and approximately 85% of the students speak a language other than English at  home. To accommodate our school community, all notices are sent home in English, Spanish, and Chinese, and all  meetings are translated. Students with disabilities make up 10% of our student population.      For the 2018-2019 school year there are 3 classes, including:   1 Dual language Chinese (Kindergarten)    1 Dual language Spanish (Kindergarten)   1 ICT (Kindergarten)    Our programming includes Physical education, technology and music through our partnerships with:   Sunset Spark     The Media Spot      The third street music settlement     PE works   At the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) , students will develop a love of learning. Students will  collaborate with others to make meaning and develop understanding of the world around them. They will us:  asking questions about the world around them; identify problems and issues; brainstorm and research for  solutions; create, test and improve solutions; and consider their audience as their ideas come into motion.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Students will acquire an understanding of materials, tools, and technology in relation to the outside world. By using  transferable academic skills, social-emotional intelligence, technological savvy, and cultural awareness, they will  demonstrate to the community how our young people can make an impact for a better world.   At the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) students will learn through in-depth studies of concepts, ideas  and interests which arise within the group. The work is considered an adventure. Projects may last one week or  could continue throughout the school year. Throughout a project, teachers help children make decisions about the  direction of study, the ways in which the group will research the topic, the representational medium that will  demonstrate and showcase the topic and the selection of materials needed to represent the work. The  presentation of concepts and hypotheses in multiple forms of representation -- print, art, construction, drama,  music, puppetry, and shadow play -- are viewed as essential to children's understanding of experience.   Our school environment will reflect a belief in the growth mindset and foster opportunities to persevere towards  goals. Learning will be of the greatest value. Students will have opportunities to reflect and afforded the  opportunity to work through the process of learning, while also reaching high levels of achievement.    Our team is united towards success by providing rigorous instruction and opportunities to develop grit. We work  collaboratively in teams to develop a challenging curriculum that provides authentic learning experiences for the  application of critical thinking skills. We work diligently to model to our students the urgency for learning, a growth  mindset, and working together for a better world. We evolve with resources, experiences, and the community.    As a school community, we will rise to meet challenges and have an unrelenting love of learning.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   A preliminary overview of incoming student data revealed the following trends:         Students at both elementary level and one of neighboring middle schools struggle with identifying relevancy  of information/evidence in a text or referring to the appropriate details in a text when supporting an answer.    Students at both elementary feeder and neighboring middle schools struggle with deciphering academic  vocabulary.      At the elementary level and middle school level, students struggle with creating and manipulating visual   representations. These include representations of fractions, tape diagrams, bar models, ratio tables, number  lines, and area models in order to solve real world word problems.      Our instructional focus this school year will be:    If I want to increase student intellectual engagement and use of academic vocabulary then I have to differentiate  instruction to meet the needs of all sub groups represented in any given class by engaging students in data driven,  small group work and partner talk.              Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans      Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive,  motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) is a new school in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn the data  we have gathered the following preliminary data.    In our inaugural year we are set to serve 100 kindergarten students. We currently are at 30% enrollment and are  working towards recruitment and expansion.   Our student body is made up 60% Asian students and 34% Hispanic students. English Language Learners comprise  80% of the student population, and approximately 85% of the students speak a language other than English at  home. . Students with disabilities make up 10% of our student population.    As such we are adopting a strong curriculum across subject areas. We currently implement Common Core aligned  curricula and instruction in literacy (Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project), math (Engage NY), and social  studies and science (Core curriculum pacing along with NYC scope and sequence).

As the School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) is a new school in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn the data  we have gathered the following preliminary data.    In our inaugural year we are set to serve 100 kindergarten students. We currently are at 30% enrollment and are  working towards recruitment and expansion.   One of our distinct advantages as a school community is our small size and intimate school culture that results in  the fact that each individual child is known well, by multiple adults, in the school building. It is common to see  several teachers working to support a student, whether that is teaming to support a child through a crisis,  collaborative outreach to families and parents, or simply just knowing, very specifically, the academic, social, and  emotional reality for individual students.

As a new, growing school, there is a natural investment in our school by the entire community. Staff and parents want  to see our school succeed and are equally invested in the outcomes of the school. We view this as a a strong  opportunity to support the growth of our school. A growing parent base will also lead to greater resources that can be  directed toward expanding extracurricular activities and opportunities for students that extend beyond the classroom  walls in the coming years. Diversity of our parent body is also a strength we hope to capitalize. We realize that our  school community can become one that promotes inclusion, honors cultural differences, and teaches children respect  not only for their own culture, but for the culture of others. As this is our end goal it is important to engage our new  families in school based opportunities that will develop this mindset and strengthen our community ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We believe that the most effective way to improve the achievement of students is to improve the quality of teaching.  Our professional development program is coherent in that we emphasize a deep understanding of the curriculum and  focus much time and attention of teachers becoming masters of the content they teach. Aligned with a clear  instructional vision that is supported through evaluation and supervision by the principal and through cycles of  coaching with the school based mentor.  In recruiting teachers, the principal created a job posting that clearly describes the instructional approach of the  school and criteria necessary to work and succeed in our school. In conjunction with the hiring committee, candidates  deemed highly qualified are invited to interview with the committee. Candidates who possess multiple licenses are  sought out in order to serve the needs of our student population, including teachers who have a bilingual extension in  order to provide flexible language programming for students.  Teaching assignments are subject first and foremost to staffing teachers that are most qualified and hold proper  licensing and certification to a particular classroom vacancy. Each spring, teachers submit a preference sheet, as per  joint DOE and UFT guidelines, for their teaching assignments for the upcoming school year. We work thoughtfully as a  hiring committee and administrative cabinet to make sure that all teachers preferences are honored as long as needs  of the school, licensing, certification, and most qualified candidates are placed in those assignments.  Our approach for both teacher retention and continued professional development go hand-in-hand. We believe a  school community in which teachers feel connected to their colleagues and supported in their instructional growth  becomes a place where teachers wish to stay and continue to grow and work.  All staff members attend a one - to two -week long (budget-driven) training program in the summer led by the  principal, coach, and teacher leaders.   All staff is expected to participate in Teacher’s College professional development opportunities. Teachers are  encouraged to attend additional DOE-sponsored PD offerings, and work with the principal to seek out additional  professional development opportunities that align to individual needs. The school will continue to engage in work  with network instructional liaisons in order to inter-visit other schools in the network that have well-developed  practices in the respective areas that a teacher may benefit from seeing.        2b.

This process is the foundation for teacher team  planning throughout the school year as teachers begin to revise and design new units of study.   Teacher teams participate in 115 minutes of professional development each week (80 minutes on Mondays, 35  minutes on Tuesdays). Grade-level teams, the ESL teacher, Visual Arts teacher, Literacy Coach/Intervention Teachers,  Math Coach, and principal rotate between grade teams to build coherence among personnel during this time. Each  week focuses on a different content area. During this time, teams look at curriculum in depth, revise our unit and  lesson planning, and reflect on student work products and engage in data analysis.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896), in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.       The School of Creativity and Innovation (15K896) will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, [PRINCIPAL's NAME], testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                 School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
