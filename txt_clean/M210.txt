This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school is dedicated to achieving academic excellence for all its students through standards-driven instruction, a  nurturing environment and the development of the civic and social skills necessary to function productively. Our  mission is to provide a dual language learning experience that will enable all students to become lifelong learners and  leaders in their communities and in our global society.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Twenty-first Century Academy for Community Leadership, P.S. /I.S. 210, is a Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 8 dual  language school, where rigorous instruction, high standards and multiple forms of assessments are used to evaluate  the progress of children.    Our school is located on 501-503 West 152 Street in Hamilton Heights. It is housed in a new state of the art building  where we have a gym/auditorium (gymnatorium) in the cellar and fully equipped specialty rooms for Science, Art,  Music, and Library.    In partnership with the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, Inc. (ACDP), a local CBO, children and  families are provided with the social / emotional, physical, and academic support that they need to be productive  citizens.   As a school we have fostered and developed many partnerships and collaborations with different organizations. We  work closely with City College, Bank Street College, and Teacher’s College for support in academic development. We  have received several grants to enhance our programming and offer students a variety of experiences including:CASA  grant/Horticultural, Artistic Dreams and Dance Theater of Harlem. We are also the beneficiaries of Reso 8 council  grants that have helped to supply our school with laptops, computers, ELMOS and Smart-boards. We have also been  offered a grant from ACDP for the social and emotional support of families and students. In addition, a free after  school program is provided for students in grades 6-8 funded by School's Out New York (SONYC) through ACDP, and a  low cost for parents after school program for grades K-5.       Data from the 2018 Environmental Survey provides information about how families feel about our school culture and  successes     97%of families say that they are satisfied with the education their child has received this year.    96% of families say that they are satisfied with the overall quality of their child's teachers this year.    94% of families say that at their school their child is safe.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school has a total population of 241 students; 100 students are General Education; 41 are Students with  Disabilities; 163 are Non-English Language Learners; and 78 are English Language Learners and an ICT class in every  grade (K-8).   The results from 2017 to 2018 in the data for grades 3-8 demonstrates that there was a gain of 19.6% in ELA and a  26.9% gain in math.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the years, our school has worked on creating a cohesive team of “Collaborative Teachers” by establishing norms  and flexible scheduling to support teacher inter-visitations. We use “Study Group” time to analyze data and  continually design and adapt instruction based on student needs and strategically align curriculum maps and units  with key standards to ensure that all students are cognitively engaged. By design, professional growth meetings every  Monday are both purposeful and theme-driven. They operate on 10-week cycles and conclude with teacher  presentations. This year we are focusing on how inquiry-based practices impact student outcomes.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Our key area of focus within the Framework for Great Schools for 2018-2019 continues to center around “Rigorous  Instruction" with a focus on Questioning and Discussion Techniques and Frequent Use of Formative Assessments  through inquiry cycles. While we have made significant progress in the ELA and Math State exams, we continue to  strive to assure that all students are challenged by enhancing instructional practices to guarantee that rigorous  learning with a range of entry points challenges all students to engage in intellectual discussions, rigorous tasks and to  produce meaningful work.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M210   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   419   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After analyzing the 2017-2018 ELA and Math State Exams and 2017-2018 Environmental Survey we looked at our  school’s “Areas of Celebration” and “Areas of Focus” to help us prioritize and develop our school wide goals.   Over the years we have seen a steady increase in the complexity level of questions students are being asked and  responding to during class or group discussions. We have observed this practice through a series of informal  observations and learning walks. These have been conducted by teacher cohorts that are scheduled three times a  year. The results from ELA and Math predictive exams indicate that students are more effectively responding to  grade-level, text-dependent questions using text evidence to support their thinking.     Based on the results of the 2018 ELA state test, our level 3s and 4s have increased from 35.3% in 2017 to 47%    Based on the results of the 2018 Math state tests, our level 3s and 4s have increased from 35.5% in 2017 to   48%   Based on the 2017-2018 Environmental Survey teachers reported;     96% of teachers in all subjects say they had the resources to link the standards from previous grades to   current grade so student knowledge/ skills build onto previous learning as foundations for math concepts.      93% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that in planning their last instructional unit, they had the resources   and tools they needed to include opportunities for students to interact with academic language.     93% of teachers in all subjects say they had the resources to focus deeply on the concepts emphasized in the   standards to help students build strong foundations for learning   o  91% of teachers in all subjects say they had the resources to develop conceptual understanding,   procedural fluency, and their ability to apply math in context.    Overall, the ELA and Math data increased by at least 10% when compared to last year in 2017 this shows that the  action plan and resources that were put in place last year supported teachers and students.   The second data sources that we analyzed was the 2017-2018 Environmental Survey;   Student's reported the following;     95% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they are learning a lot in their classes at their school to   prepare them for the next level or grad's     93% of students say that its clear what they need to do to get a good grade.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14        91% of students responded that, in most of their classes, the work they do is good preparation for their class   tests.     90% of students say that their classes at their school make them think critically.   Students in grade 8 are also taking three regents courses in preparation for high schools. The exams that are being  offered are the Math regents, Living environment regents, and the LOTE. Overall, students taking these exams are  performing similar to students Citywide.   In 2017 our school administered the Algebra Regents for the first time to about half of 8th grade students. Item  analysis reports show that our school averaged 65.7%.    In 2018 our school administered the Algebra Regents to all 8th grade students, averaging 58.26% compared to a  Citywide average of 66.33%.    Science Regents item analysis shows that our students performed at 70.08% in 201 to 67.47% in 2018 and 70.03%  Citywide average.       Spanish Regents item analysis shows that all of our students are performing __________%.   An analysis of the 2017-2018 data shows that the work teachers and coaches have done is curricula and assessment  alignment to inform instruction has made gains in both ELA and Math. Using the Depth of Knowledge Framework  (DOK), our teachers have designed performance tasks that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards in  both ELA and Mathematics. In addition, they include UDL and ENL strategies that support the instructional goals and  meet the individual needs of both English Language Learners and students with special needs.   The results from the data demonstrates a steady increase in many areas, however based on 2018 data analysis we will  continue this work on expanding our school-wide focus of enhancing questioning and discussion techniques and  frequent use of formative assessments to inform instructional future lessons across classrooms. We will also focus on  students taking ownership of the questioning process so they can understand and assess their own learning through  self-evaluation checklists and peer evaluations.    Some of our strengths in student, teacher and parents response from the Environmental Survey when compared to  last year 2017 are the following.             (an increase of 10% from 2017) 64% of students responded that, in most or all their classes, they are  challenged  (an increase of 7% from 2017) 64% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers  ask difficult questions on tests   (slight drop of 2% from 2017) 52% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers  ask difficult questions in class       One of our area of focus this year will be on Questioning and Discussion Techniques   Our second area of focus this year is to engage in Periodic Progress Monitoring   This will be accomplished by developing higher order thinking questions, rigorous periodic performance tasks and  developing multiple entry points in both ELA and Math,        Part 2 – Annual Goal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

We selected  questions that showed a high percent of students that did not perform well on particular questions and we analyzed  the framing of the question and exposed students to the language within their class tasks or homework assignments  for practice.    Released questions from the item analysis showed that students had difficulties understanding open-ended  questions; as a result intervention is required for groups of students who made little improvement. This year, our  focus will continue to be on questioning and discussion, but through the lens on conferring 3d: using assessment in  instruction. Teachers will observe each other during inter-visits in 2 cycles of Learning walks a conference and record  low inference notes on the type of questions that are being asked from the teacher and students. Immediate  actionable feedback is given which are discussed during our bi-weekly study group meetings.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      An area of focus:      Strengthen goal setting and action planning at the school level and ensure that this plan is informed by a  comprehensive, data driven needs assessment and ongoing data gathering to yield improvement in teacher  practice and student achievement.    Next Steps     Engage in periodic monitoring of the school-wide academic goals for all students and the professional goals      for teachers.  In addition, come up with a short list of clear, focused school leveled goals that are connected to the district  priorities, the Framework for Great Schools and the identified needs of the students in the school.     Meet with teachers in teams or individually to agree on school-wide goals for professional development after   the analysis of the state data results, internal assessments, portfolio review and Advance.     Our school needs to work on aligning assessments to curricula, use ongoing assessment and grading   practices, and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the  team and classroom level           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June of 2019, there will be a 10% increase in teachers responses on Peer Support and Academic Work. Teachers and  coaches will implement systems to effectively use data to drive instruction and improve student outcomes.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Research-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact  change            Study Group:   Study group meetings are scheduled for teachers to  meet with an instructional coach (ELA or Math) in grade  bands on a bi-weekly basis. Teachers collectively ensure  that learning needs are met and are given the  opportunity to collaborate and discuss student work  through inquiry discussions.     Teachers have the option to be in an ELA or math group   to plan for the year. The ELA coach and Math coach  devise a year long pacing calendar that will address  school wide goals and also based on the needs of the  teachers. As a result, instructional strategies targeting  different groups of students are aligned across  classrooms.     Teachers evaluate the effectiveness of these discussions   through ongoing reflective feedback. After several  meetings on sharing best practices and analyzing student  work through inquiry cycles, teachers and coaches  conduct learning walks to continue the planning and  effectiveness of the implementation of strategies.   Learning walks:  Teachers are given the opportunity to visit other teachers to  observe an area they feel they need more support. Last, year we  had 3 cycles of inter-visits where teams of teachers observed  other teachers in the area of 3b: questioning and discussion  techniques. This decision was based on the analysis of the ELA  and math scores and also what teachers felt was a priority.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.     Some of the strategies and activities that we have in place to ensure that we hire the most highly qualified teachers  are as follows:      Recruitment:       Candidates who show an interest in a position are interviewed by a team of administrators, teachers and parents. The  committee develops a list of questions based on their knowledge in the content areas, dual language philosophy,  pedagogical practices, behavioral management, and parent/community outreach. If the committee shows an interest  in a candidate, the interviewee is scheduled during the same week for a demo lesson.     We look at our Bilingual Pupil Services interns for possible candidates.    We also look at the open market for possible candidates.   Retention:     Teachers are encouraged to develop and strengthen their skills as reflective practitioners by taking on   leadership roles in their study group meetings and during the Monday Professional Learning Community time.  The ELA and Math coach supports teachers to carry out their responsibilities in alignment with the school- wide goals and Instructional Shifts as described in the CCLS,      Teachers across the grades have also formed a variety of committees to support each other (i.e. Inclusion  committee, curriculum planning and inter-visitations). We have them share their knowledge and expertise  with the school community and parents in efforts to sustain a cohesive learning environment that promotes  leadership.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Assignments:    We assign teachers based on their interest, seniority and strengths.      Professional Development:    We view professional development opportunities as an integral part of teacher development where teachers are  allowed to reflect on practice, solidify their understanding on what is effective instruction and do inter-visitations on  what effective practice should look like.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).        Teachers engage in biweekly study groups primarily focused on inquiry work. The groups are divided into      cohorts of grades K-2; 3-5; and, 6-8. Within the cohorts the teachers are allowed to choose an area of interest  between Literacy or Math. Decisions for the year’s PD is developed based on the feedback of the Quality  Review, analysis of assessments and the individual needs of our staff.  In the early part of the year the study group participants analyze student baseline data to identify the areas of  need. Teachers use the data to improve their practice and for vertical alignment across the grades. Teachers  who administer and grade MOSL assessments use the information gathered from the data to inform their  instruction. They create their groups focusing on specific indicators that need to be reinforced. Teachers also  integrate the various Core Curriculum programs into their existing units and discuss how to use the new  resources as a supplement to meet the needs of their diverse students. This year, our focus will be on 3b:  questioning and Discussion Techniques; 3c: Engaging students in Learning and 3d: Using Assessment in  Instruction from the Danielson Framework. These decisions were made by a committee of administrators  and teachers based on the analysis of student work.     Professional Development: Teachers from various grade levels have the opportunity to visit peer schools to   observe demo lessons and strategies to implement in their own classroom.  Learning walks- Teachers engage in inter-visitations to observe teachers practice.       Professional learning for paraprofessionals initiative, a collaboration between the district and field support   center.    The NYC Mathematics Project (Consultant) - Middle school mathematics teachers work with math consultant to  develop and implement units and assessment tasks aligned to the Common Core using CMP3 and EngageNY units of  study.    The principal will also engage in professional development. Through district wide PD offered by the   Superintendent. And through the Chancellor and the CSA.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Orientation meetings are conducted by the parent coordinator in November-December for families that show an  interest in our dual language program. During these meetings, parents are informed about our school philosophy,  policy and expectations. A tour is also provided for parents to get a sense of the school environment and culture. The  parent coordinator highlights key features of our school (i.e “state of the art” science lab, art room, music room, roof  top playground, large gymnatorium (gym/ auditorium) and large and inviting library.   Our parent coordinator also participates in school fairs to recruit students for Pre-Kinder and Kindergarten.      Teacher attends the pre-k professional development meetings offered throughout the year.    During the PD teachers are trained on how to implement the Pre-k Curriculum.     Instructional coordinator supports the implementation of the units and facilitates the workshops for Pre K  teachers.     An assigned social worker assist Pre- K teacher in identifying students and initiating the evaluation process for   possible services if needed.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.           In Math, the K-2 teachers create and revise baseline assessments that are administered 3 times a year. In  grades 3-8, teachers administer the baseline and mid-line assessments generated through NYC Schoolnet.  Based on the analysis of base and mid-line assessments, teachers create short periodic assessments which  reflects the incorrect answers. The Blackline Master from the Board of Education is used as the end-line.         In ELA, we use the CCLS rubric to evaluate student pre and post writing performance tasks. Teachers meet in  grade teams to create performance tasks for each genre and are administered across the grades. During study   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60               group, teachers norm, grade and evaluate the quality of the writing to make informed instructional decisions.  Informal evaluations are done through daily conferences and are documented through the use of teachers  created checklist.     Benchmark assessment program by Fountas & Pinnell in English for grades K- 8 in English was decided   collaboratively by the teachers, coaches and administration. We noticed that the WRAP in English no longer  addressed some of what has been identified in the ELA instructional shifts. We needed an assessment tool  that asked higher order thinking inference questions and not just the literal. After reviewing the sample  questions between the two assessment tools, collectively we decided that using Fountas and Pinnell will be  the best tool to evaluate students reading and comprehension level among other skills. We still use WRAP  (Writing Reading Assessment Profile) in Spanish in grades 3 to 8 since Fountas and Pinnell is not available in  Spanish for those grades.     We use the Estrellita program as our RTI program in Spanish and Fundations in English. In the case of both the   Estrellita and the Fundations program we have sent teachers and their paras out for training in the use of  these programs. We have also put in place many RTI strategies that have been turn keyed by our ELA coach  and AP, who attended the training for RTI. Parts of our strategies have been to look at creative ways to give  extra support to our targeted students.     4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Twenty-First Century Academy for Community Leadership, in compliance with  the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Twenty-first Century Academy for Community Leadership will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;               The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement           holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand            School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)         Twenty-first Century Academy for Community Leadership, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and  support of student achievement between the school and the families.

Procedure:   1.  MS ENL groups will be studying N.Y.C. waterways from colonial times to the present.    2.  Elementary ENL group will be exploring different communities in Manhattan.   3.  MS SIFE students will study how the Island of Manhattan was founded, beginning with its  indigenous people, colonialism, and the metropolis of today.  4. MS EP students will study the development and preservation of different parks in Manhattan,  such as Riverbank, Fort Tryon Park, Central Park, etc.  First, students will be given historical background of their respective subject.  Secondly, a field  trip will follow to further enhance students' knowledge and development of the topic.  Third, the  field trip experience will be brought back to the classroom to culminate in an activity that will  either involve art, poetry, music, or short play writing.     Materials: Materials used for all four groups will include  videos, pamphlets from the various  places we will visit,  history books such as Howard Zinn's "A Young People's History of the  United States", maps, and other supplemental materials especially for the Spanish speaking  groups.  We will be using $504 from the budget to purchase art materials, including construction  paper, printing paper, folders, crayons, color pencils, and regular #2 pencils, and folders.      Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:  (a) ENL students are identified from the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. (b) SIFE students are  identified by the WRAP Spanish reading and writing test.  (c) EP students are identified by  NYSESLAT and ELA scores.  Elementary ENL Entering and Transitioning will be 14 students.  MS ENL Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding will be 16 students.  SIFE will be 10 students.  EP students will be 10 students.    Schedule and duration: The program will be two days a week, Wednesday and Thursday, from  3:00 to 5:00 p.m. It will run for 22 weeks, beginning Wednesday, October 10, 2018, and ending  on Thursday, March 21, 2019, for a total of 44 days.  Any additional cost needed to implement  the program will be taken from other school funding sources.    Language of Instruction:  The language of instruction for ENL Entering and LTE’s students will  be in English.  Students identified as SIFE will be instructed in Spanish.  EP students who are  struggling in Spanish and are part of the Dual Language program will also receive instruction in  Spanish.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information     Number and Types of Certified Teachers: There are two ENL certified teachers; the other  two teachers are Bilingual certified.    The ENL component is taught by Soledad De León licensed ENL teacher for the elementary  grades;  Isabel Lobelo licensed ENL teacher for the MS grades;  SIFE instruction will be provided by Angela Silverio, Bilingual Common Branch and Literacy  licensed teacher.   Services for EP students will be provided by Josefina Báez, Bilingual Common Branch licensed  teacher.      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                 Rationale:  As a Dual Language school, our professional development program focuses on  supporting teachers to become more efficient in teaching our ELL population.  Teachers are  equipped with research based ENL strategies and techniques to teach the four modalities of  language acquisition, complying as well with the DOE’s philosophy of teaching language.    Teachers to Receive Training:  All four teachers in the TIII program receive weekly training  through Monday PD, bi-weekly study groups, as well as ELL leads workshops provided by the  DOE and UFT programs on ENL teaching practices based on the new standards.    Schedule and Duration: In-house study groups meet according to grade bands two periods every  two weeks for two periods: K-2 meets Wednesday, 3-5 meets Tuesdays, and MS 6-8 meets on  Thursdays.  Individual attendance of PD’s varies per month or date.    Topics to be covered:  Content area training is done bi-weekly by grade bands K-2, 3-5, 6- 8.  This is a compilation of learning walks where notes are taken for best instructional practices  on how to address our ELL’s academic needs, and study group meetings where data is analyzed  to implement and modify instruction.  In addition, this year for Monday’s PD we will be  implementing an ENL collaborative group to discuss all pertinent data of ELL students and  develop a plan to integrate best ENL teaching practices.  Moreover, grade teams and individual  teachers also attend PDs, throughout the City, for all content areas for training of different  foundations and strategies that focus on new methods of teaching not only ELL’s literacy skills,  but NLA as well.  Our ELL lead participates in the 5 series workshop offered by the MSFC ELL Department  offered by Dr. Pedro De La Cruz.  The series of workshops will facilitate continuous learning among ELL educators.  Each session  aims to deepen participants' understanding and knowledge of ELL policies and effective  instruction.  The instructional focus is on literacy across disciplines.  This series will use the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72            Part C: Professional Development   knowledge-building approach to developing language in unit design within an Advanced  Literacy framework. Participants will learn to design instructional units for knowledge building  in content areas and reflect on their practices in the classrooms to affect students’ learning.   Topics include:  Topic One:   Knowledge-building approach to developing language – Unit Design in Advanced  Literacy Framework  Date:  Topic Two:   Design learning tasks in content area units        Topic Three: Scaffold Interactive Learning tasks in units        Topic Four:   Bring It Together – Units for ENL Co-teaching and Stand-Alone Classrooms                  Topic Five:    Share of Learning – What Was the Impact on Learning?   In house PD:  ELA and MATH coaches, and teacher-to-teacher collaboration, and sources  throughout the City, including DOE, Bank Street, TC, UFT, and Fordham University.   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               Rationale:  When parents are active participants in their children's education, it is a win win  situation.  Thus, we believe that engaging parents in academia will give them a better  understanding of the academic process of their children, and empower both parent and child  alike.  Moreover, learning about American History will broaden their knowledge of U.S. culture,  and hopefully affect their perspective as immigrants in this country.       Parent Engagement will be aligned to the Social Studies theme that will be used with the students  during the TIII program, primarily the study of New York City Waterways.   Parents will be notified through letters, Robo calls and Remind both in English and Spanish.  Translation and interpretation unit will be called as needed.  Parent participation will be kept on  file in school.   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.  Ensure that your  Title III budget matches your Title III Plan.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In September we used the NYSITELL, SLAB (Spanish LAB-R), and the NYSESLAT results to inform us of the students’ English and  Spanish proficiency.  This data helps us to identify and group the students for differentiated instruction, and ENL services.  In  grades K-8 we use the Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark assessment tool kit in English and Spanish; and in grades 3-8 we  also use the WRAP in Spanish.  Both assessment tools aid us in determining if the student is literate or pre-literate in their  native language.  If the ELL student is not reading at grade level, we provide AIS services to comply with the NYS literacy  standard using informational text.    Based on the aforementioned assessment, Estrellita is also used for small group instruction in K-2, and Sábelotodo for grades  3-5.  For grades 6-8 the WRAP guides us for SLA and guided reading instruction.  We use the June end-line test as a baseline for  September's assessment as a starting point for some ELL students, and we test the incoming ELL students to determine their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      reading level, and English proficiency.      We chose Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark Assessment kit in English and Spanish for grades K-3.  We also include the NYS  rubrics for personal narrative, informational piece, and argument writing through grades K-8, to teach ELL students how to  develop their writing and express their ideas clearly.  In addition, for grades 3-8 students will be assessed through the new  Home Language Assessment (HLA) exam to measure the SLA proficiency; the results of the HLA also serve for the 8th graders  to receive credits when they enter high school.    As we analyze the scores this year, we notice that overall students have made progress and are slowly moving out of a level 1  in ELA.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The aforementioned assessments guides us in creating differentiated instruction, in inquiry work and guided reading.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In grades K-5 we use the Fountas & Pinnell (F&P)  Benchmark assessments to set students benchmark and progress in  English.  In Spanish we use the assessment instrument to set benchmark assessments in Spanish in grades K-3.  For grades 4-8  we use the WRAP assessment in Spanish.  In grades 6-8 We use the writing assessment essay put out by the Dept. of Ed.  as  the instrument to use for the Measure Of Student Learning  MOSL.  We give on on  demand essay in English & in Spanish as a  bench mark to measure students growth throught out the year.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data has been gathered, it is used to inform teachers of their students performance and to form small  groups when  planning for AIS, after-school, and Saturday tutoring programs.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   In looking at the yearly growth of our students we found that the gap between EP students and ELLs would understandably  very wide especially for those that were more recent arrival.  What we did notice was that once students passed the  NYSESLAT, they were able to close that gap considerably as former ELLs.  Once ELLs become proficient in English, the gap  between ELLs and  EP students wound be very much reduced and in some cases the students were able to surpass the EP  students in the area of math.   Also, the Dual Language program proved to be successful for our African-American students  who showed growth and performance in a positive way when it came to standardize testing.                In recent years we changed our language policy to fit a model that would allow for students to be exposed and taught in both  English and Spanish on a daily basis, by dividing the day in such a way where the teacher would teach 3 instructional periods in  one language and then have them switch to the other language.  After a range of 4-6 weeks depending on the grade  and writing genera the student would switch the language of the morning to the later part of the day and visa-versa.   PreK &  K follows a model of switching  morning and afternoon.  In grades 6-8 students get Native Language Arts in Spanish (NLA) and  ELA instruction throughout the day. For those students identified as ELLs through the NYSITELL, they continue to take the  NYSESLAT until they test out. The Spanish LAB-R is also given to determine the support they need.  Non-Spanish speakers are  tested in the ELE to measure their proficiency and growth in Spanish, and to guide next steps for teacher planning.       When teachers plan a curriculum unit in any one particular subject area, they include language structures, visuals, and other  ENL methodologies.  Direct ENL instruction from K-8 includes TPR, teacher made material, focusing mainly in the linguistics  demands that students need to become proficient speakers, listeners, readers, and writers in English.  These demands include  phonemic awareness, idiomatic expressions, syntax, conventions of grammar, writing mechanics, for students to fully learn the  sounds, comprehend meaning and form of the complexity of the English.  In addition, we use the TC model of literacy to  develop independent writing skills, and this is done by units in the elementary school, i.e., one unit selected in Spanish and one   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77         unit selected in English.      For student being exposed to the language for the first time the focus is mainly on sharpening their reading and writing skills in  their first language. As they become more proficient in their second language we use some of the same strategies and skills to  help them develop their reading and writing in the second language.  And while we do not water down the curriculum we  make sure that scaffold are put in place to guarantee success in comprehension and understanding of the structures of the  new language.   In the beginning students are encouraged to develop academic skills in his or her first language, in order to  make the transition to the new language less traumatizing.  Throughout the progression of the program, the students will be  exposed to all the academic activities (reading, writing, math, etc.) through development of curriculum objectives and  language objectives.     Part of our RTI strategies is to look at the assessment data to plan our interventions with students.  We identify those grades  that are more in need than others, and  we flood the class with teachers and other support staff at least two to three times a  week for additional small group instruction.  In our plan we recognize that 1st grade has a great need because it is the place  where students transition from socialization to reading and writing. Thus, we work all year round with 1st grade.  Then we  work with 2nd grade flooding the class with additional teachers and support staff to have them work with small groups of  students to help them catch up.  We look to work with second grade at the start of the year and switch mid way to  Kindergarten, and work with Kindergarten for the rest of the year.  We also divide the middle school students into ELA, math  and science groups, and have all middle school teachers work with  groups of 10 students or less twice and week as part of our  ATR initiative.  We also identify students that need additional help in Literacy & Math and have them come in for additional  tutoring during after-school and on Saturday.                6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    We use all the in house assessments like the MOSL and benchmark test that we give the students as part of the ADVANCE to  measure students' level of learning.  We also use the EDAT tool where we are able to upload important assessment  information from ATS to inform our list of students for AIS and plan for students.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We share the outcomes of our students' performance at the 1st PD at the beginning of the year.  At that meeting we share  how we did as a school and how we compared to the district and the city.  We also look at areas of strength and needs to be  determined based on the out comes.  We then have one on one meeting with the teachers where we look at the individual  performance of the students based on the grade and class that they worked in.  At that meeting I share students growth based  on the F&P MOSL for grades K-5 and the Essay on demand writing piece for grades 6-8.  We also look at the ELA & Math scores  from the previous year to see student performance when they were with the teacher the previous year and the RNMR report  that shows student performance and growth.  We also look at the NYSESLAT scores and determine the level of language  acquisition of the student and how much growth was accomplished for the year.  We also use our Study Group (SG) meeting to  discuss outcomes, look at student work and analyze student work for progress and next steps.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We do not have any Freestanding ENL programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The Instructional delivery model of our content area is delivered in two languages.  We use a 60% /40% Spanish and  English model for the students in Pre -k to 4, where the students are with one assigned teacher that is bilingual and  provides instruction in the language of the day. The model follow a specific calendar that is aligned  with the literacy  writing pacing charts for grades Kg. to 4th grade.  In grades 5 through 8 the language is divided by time and by  teacher.     For students that are new to the language we have them focus on their dominant language 1st and slowly incorporate  skill and strategies that are in line with the curriculum and the literacy genera but being mindful of incorporating  language structures and scaffolds that will help make the lesson  more comprehensible for the students.  In 5th grade  we have a side by side model, where one fifth grade teacher teaches Science and Math and the other fifth grade  teacher teaches Literacy and Social Studies. In  grades 6-8 the language model is then structured by teacher  assignment, time and curriculum in a 50% / 50% Spanish/English model, where teachers are scheduled to give their  content in an assigned language.  I.e. Humanities (Literacy/Social Studies) Spanish and Humanities (Literacy and Social  Studies teacher in English).      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As a DL school, in grades 6-8  Entering and Emerging ELLs are pulled out by the ENL teacher 180 minutes a week. Students also  receive  an additional 135 minutes of instruction provided by the ELA teacher.  In grades 3-5 the ENL teacher also pushes in  and pulls out  the Entering and Emerging students for 180 minutes per week, as well as 135 minutes with the classroom  teacher.   We also have the co-teaching model where the ENL teacher works together with the Humanities  teachers in grades  6-8, and with the elementary teachers in grades 1-5,  to provide the adequate number of minutes in  ENL instruction.  In  addition, ELL students with an IEP also receive SETTS services, as well as speech therapy services by a Bilingual speech &/  or SETTS  teacher.  How the SETTS and Speech teachers work with the students is determined by the students IEP.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       In all the grades teachers plan for students who are below, at or above level.  Instruction is provided with language functions  and language structures that assist the students to work at a level where they can be immersed in the language in a rigorous  manner, while provided with language structures and scaffolds that can help make the lesson more comprehensible.    We use  a balance literacy model to teach literacy in both English and Spanish with special focus on discourse, reading comprehension,  vocabulary development and writing.  We have a special time set aside where the whole school reads for 20 to 30 minutes on  their own to help them develop an appreciation of reading ie. Dear time (Drop Everything And Read).  We also  use  more non  fiction literacy books to assist students in gaining academic rigor, vocabulary development and content understanding through  the use of non fiction books that provides new information and learning experiences in a scaffold but sophisticated manner.  We also focus on phonemic awareness and basic literacy skills. We also use student friendly rubrics and the 6 traits reading  and writing program to provide teachers and students with strategies that help them to gain a better understanding of how to  tackle more rigorous materials by focusing on those strategies and questioning structures that can help them observe and  record what they can do.  Ie. rubrics, Depth of Knowledge (DOK)  questions and book clubs in the lower grades and Socratic  Seminar in the Middle School (MS).  All along the way the teachers plan language objectives, use TPR, Partner reading,  Cooperative learning, Turn and Talk strategies along side with their content objectives.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are given the Benchmark (F&P) assessment / WRAP reading assessments  at the beginning of the school year, and  once again at the end,  Mid year we give them a writing sample to check for their improvement in writing according to the Six   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      traits design.  Students are also provided with instruction and assessed in both languages based on the annual pacing calendar  used for literacy instruction throughout the year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    (a) SIFE students receive literacy instruction in Spanish to alphabetize them in their language, as well as literacy instruction in  ENL.   (b) For newcomers students are pulled-out for ENL instruction everyday, and also throughout the day the student receives ENL  instruction throughout the content area with the subject teacher.    (c) Students are pulled-out three times a week for ENL instruction, and ENL teachers also push-in during the day. Some  students are enrolled in a small groups for early literacy instruction or during AIS periods twice a week in MS.  They also  receive instruction in the Title III after school program.   (e)  Long terms ELLs are given English instruction throughout the day in the content areas, using ENL strategies.    (d) Former ELLs in years 1 and 2 after becoming proficient, are pulled out twice a week for ENL instruction, they continue to  have time-and-a-half during state exams.  They also receive ENL instruction during extended day, and in the Title III after  school program.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Reading:  With beginner students we modify our speech, i.e., reading slowly, pausing, gesturing, repeating, and TPR.  We use  visuals and realia and non-verbal cues to get them to understand what we are doing.  We also use pattern books with high  frequency words that gives them a hand full of words that they can depend on in any given situation.  With intermediate and  advanced students in addition to all the strategies mentioned we build on students’ vocabulary through the use of graphic  organizers, hands-on activities, paraphrasing, use of context clues and clarifying for meaning and understanding, as well as  displays and referential questions.  Before reading a text we go over some of the more important terms and vocabulary words,  we preview the text by looking at picture clues and titles to predict what the book is about.  We also do book walks that offer  the students a preview of what is coming and a chance to hear and ask question that can help with the test.  We have the  student do accountable talk of a text by have them take time out to talk with a partner what they understood this last activity  is also a prerequisite to having them do book clubs in the upper grades.  To build students’ vocabulary and content  understanding, we ask higher order thinking questions (DOK), we model the thinking aloud, and use the Accelerated Literacy  Learning workshop (Balanced literacy) model applying the ENL strategies that  makes the activity more comprehensible.   In  the MS we also engage the students in Socratic Seminars where they work in groups of 4 to discuss text make on argument  and back up their thinking using evidence from the text.  This strategy also provide the ENL students with support form his or  her peers and give them in dept time in listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Strategies that are critical to the development  of content knowledge, vocabulary and understanding.     Writing:  With the beginner students we scaffold the writing line by line, providing sentence starters and rubrics for the  students to follow.  We also provide and encourage the students to use the rich print environment in the classroom as a  resource to help them with words that are difficult to spell.  In interactive writing we teach pattern sentences, punctuation,  spelling, and vocabulary.  We also provide language structures and sentence starters to help students along with their thinking  as they develop language and writing. With the intermediate and advanced students we model the writing process with  sentence structures, and scaffold paragraph development using L1 to increase vocabulary using cognates.  We use interactive  writing to increase students’ participation, enhancing their oral skills in the process.   Students are also grouped and paired to  work together cooperatively.  We use the students’ own experience to develop their personal stories and polish their  sentences by rephrasing correctly and transitional words.  We use L1 to enhance and improve students’ vocabulary.  We also  use literacy games that build on grammar, spelling and vocabulary development.  We also provide the students with student   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      friendly rubrics that they can use to  measure their own progress in writing by following the criteria in a rubric that shows them  where they are at in their level of fluency.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Content area teachers developed a curriculum aligned with the CCSS, using the DOK, the Danielson's Framework for  Teaching.  CMP3 is used for Math in the MS, and Engage NY for Math.  We also us Engage NY for Math for problem solving  math comprehension and Go Math for drill and practice in the elementary grades.  In addition, we a balance literacy approach  in reading where we immerse the students in reading and writing, give them many opportunities to engage in reading and  writing and use the Six Traits plus one strategies to organize the writing in a consistent way throughout the grades.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Name of Academic Intervention Services (AIS)     In the description of our AIS program which is provided to all our students at risk we do the one or a combination of the  following:     ELA:    In addition to our Balanced literacy program provided in both English and Spanish, we use for students identified in need of  AIS, some of the following programs and strategies:            - Simple Solutions-  a conventions skills fluency program that is fun fast and researched based.          -Words Their Way a program designed to increase knowledge of phonetic element.           -6 Traits Rubric - a writing rubric program designed in both Spanish and English that focuses on writing with special  attention given to ideas, organization, word choice, sentence fluency, voice and conventions.  The Rubric focuses attention on  students strength and area of need.           - Fundations-  a phonics program geered to assist student in gaining letter and sound recognition.    Guided Reading            -Collaborative Strategic Reading-focuses on specific comprehensive strategies.  Student do reading in a variety of forms,  gided by the teacher.  The student reads text makes an argument or statement of what was the author's meaning and then  cites where in the text his or her thinking is confirmed.  Also through the use of more non fiction text, students have a better  chance to develop content vocabulary as well as more content.      NLA:  Estrellita (RTI) The Estrellita program focuses on phonimic awareness of the students in Spanish. Given in a methodical  manner, the Estrellita program teaches the students phonimic strategies for how to break words down into syllables and  sounds in order to be able to attack new and unknown words.  The program is also designed to return to student who need  more help in any given area and provides for lessons that can be given in small groups and in an individual manner.  They  stress fidelity to the program in how it should be implemented.  This program is for the early grades Kg.-1st and is ended once  the students have graduated to knowing all their letters and letter sounds.    Buen Dicho- Spanish grammar practice book that provides the students with practice in the conventions of the language in  Spanish.    Mathematics:     -By using base-line and end of lesson unit assessments the teachers can examen their success in getting the students to reflect  on their progress and next steps for tutoring and reexamination. Lessons are created that target students strengths and needs;  through the use of periodic unit test and conferencing the teacher can observe the strategies that the students use to tackle  problems, do problem solving and check for misconcepcions. Also,     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      -By focusing on extended response questions the student can explain their understanding of a concept and argue why an  answer is correct,  we are meeting the instructional expectation set forth by the Chancellor.  Also through the use of the  Engage NY curriculum we can aligning our curriculum with the CCLS and weave them into all in the different content areas.       In addition to the different assessments offered throughout the year, conferencing and Math strategies are aligned to the new  CCLS and the new curriculum, with special focus on the new chancellors expectations that encourages multiples ways of  representing a problem.  Strategies for problem solving and a detailed written argument to explain their work.          UDL-The use of Univesal Design for Learning (UDL) strategies are also encouraged in all the different content areas with the  thought of showing that there are different ways that a student can show understanding of a concept.  It also provides  different entry points for students who learn in different ways.      Science:     In Science the teachers use both Spanish an English text books to do their lessons.  The teachers use a variety of materials to  teach Science in order to allow for different entry points with the students.  As much as possible teacher use technology, smart  boards, Elmos, overhead projectors to demonstrate or show the students the curriculum.  They also use a project base  approach to teach the student how to delve deep into the study of a project.  All this is done through UDL lessons that provide  for different entry points into a project.  It also develops languge in that at time students also have to present their findings to  the school through an annual Science fair.  For Students that are learning one of the two languages, it offers the student the  opportunity  to develop language by through  presentations, and  by providing scaffolds, vocabulary development and quality  time to learn one particular area of study.  The teachers use non-fiction Science passages to teach literacy. Additional Health  and Science is given throughout the grades by the classroom teachers and the cluster Science teachers.  Science is also an area  that is given Study Group planning time by the coaches in order to continue to align the Science Curriculum to the CCLS.     Social Studies:     Similar to the plan described in Science, the teachers use non-fiction Social Studies passages to teach literacy.  AIS push-in and pull-out teachers also use non-fiction and realistic fiction to teach literacy strategies through Social Studies.  Projects, presentations and programs are use to show what has been learned and present in a creative manner the content  area being studied.     At-risk Services Provided by the Guidance Counselor:       Individual counseling sessions provided during the school day addressing study skills, stress/anger management, relaxation  techniques, conflict resolution and goal setting.  In the Middle grades more stress is given to the HS selection process where  students are encouraged sooner rather than later to look at schools that are in line with what they want to do and seek out the  criteria for entrance to those schools.  Students that are selected to go to the DREAM project are highly encouraged to do so in  order to be competative with other students who will be taking the entrance exams for Specialized HS.  Our Guidance  counselor also provides Advisory lesson for the student in a small group weekly bases to discuss organizing skills, HW;  problems and how to handle them and community service.  We also plan visits to an Institute of Higher learning for the 7th  grade students through the College Access Program of the Dept. of Education to get them started in looking to attend college.     In addition our guidance counselor also pulls out at risk students and recommend them for outside services when more is  needed.  Our guidance counselors also invite outside groups to continues to work with students in teaching them strategies for  dealing with difficult situations and works with them on how to resolve conflicts creatively. I.e. Bullying, Cyber Bullying, sex,  drugs, gangs.        At-risk Health-related Services:     We have a nurse that tends to student with serious medical needs.  We also have a health  teacher that gives the students health related classes once a week, and we have PT and OT teachers that work with students  with IEP.     AIS services provided by teachers in different grade and subject areas:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82        We have a Setts teachers that provides services to students with IEP not in ICT classes.  This teachers is licensed in Special  needs and offers different strategies to students who are at risk.     Two new areas of focus for us are the ELG groups and the AIS groups in middle grades.     The scheduled service is provided as follows:    In the beginning of the academic school year we identify literacy teachers Spanish/English with free periods to push into grade  2 to give additional small group instruction to students identified in need of further services.  The purpose is to get them  strong in what they need to do in the early part of second grade so that the students can develop independence in what they  need to do.  In January we then switch the available teachers to Kindergarten and 1st grade classes where at this time start  showing who is in need of more individualize or small group services.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In the incoming year we will continue to use the Fundations & Estrellita program for student in grades Kg-2.  In those grades it  has proven to be an effective way to get the students ready for reading and writing and the teachers jave had great success  with it .  We will also continue to use our Balanced Literacy program and will have the added assistance of a DOE staff  developer to help us make our Balanced Literacy program more consistent throughout the grades.  We will continue to use the  6Traits plus 1 to organize for writing and use The Code X reading guide as a resource for 6 Traits in the middle school.  The  purpose of this is to help fill in the curriculum gaps that we had in our skill development area.  We have also put the go math  as a supplement to our Engage NY  math program, recognizing the need for more fluency in skills practice for the students, but  again recognizing that the test is geared more towards reading, writing and explanation of a problem in addition to solving it.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are not discontinuing any part of our DL programs.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We provide our ELLs with additional help during the day and after school.  As much as possible we offer our student different  programs that are of interest to them at different times of the day and different days of the week.  We have  electives,  tutoring, Champs after-school programs and the Title III after-school program.  It may be that they cannot take all  the classes being offered but they will have some choices to have equal access to many of the other programs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In addition to all the program provided under question 8 we also provide Imagine Learning; IXL computer based math  program; Khan Academy; IPad math program and other smart board programs.  In addition to computers in the classrooms the  students have access to laptops, IPads, Elmos and calculators. In all the different content areas.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The instruction of literacy and writing in both languages is done with the support of a teacher who helps the student scaffold  the learning of the new language, and reinforces and develops their first language (Spanish or English). For those students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83      designated by the NYSITELL as an ELL, the NYSESLAT is given until he or she has tested out. In English the students need a score  of 41% in the NYSESLAT in order to determine their proficiency. The LAB-R is also given in Spanish to all the students to create  a baseline assessment of where the students was when he started attending our dual language school.  These assessments are  then used to guide instruction, form groups and measure for growth, proficiency and progress.  Teacher assessments are also  used in L1.  We use balance literacy to develop independent reading and writing skills by developing writing units that are  scheduled throughout the year in both languages. In the early grades we start students writing in their native language and  slowly bring them in to the scheduled writing activities as they gain fluency in L2.  We also take the opportunity to do writing  on the assigned Spanish days in order to create a routine of thing that you do on English days and things that you do on  Spanish days (three days in Spanish and two days in English).  In the middle grades students read and write in both languages  every day depending on the schedule, curriculum area and teacher assignment.       In the early grades students identified as beginning students are encouraged to develop academic skills in his or her first  language, in order to make the transition to the new language less traumatizing. Studies show that students transfer learned  skills from L1 to L2.  Throughout the progression of the program, the students will be exposed to all the academic activities  (reading, writing, math, etc.) through development of curriculum objectives and language objectives.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In addition to having highly effective bilingual teachers providing direct services to all students.  We also have age appropriate  and grade appropriate common core standard align curriculum that address the needs of all the ELL students.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share our building with any other school.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before students come to the school we provide the parents with an orientation of how we will be working with their children  and the different options they have.  Once enrolled in the school they are entitled to all the different programs that the ELLs  are entitled to.    We also provide at registration a licensed ENL teacher that explains the different program options provided  by the DOE and interview them in filling out the HILS form.  They are also available for any questions that the parent may have  while viewing or after view the assigned video.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer any other language as an elective.  Our school is a dual language English / Spanish school.  In 8th grade the  students are expected to take the Spanish LOTE.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The Instructional delivery model of our content area is delivered in two languages.  We use a 60% /40%  Spanish and English model for the students in Pre -k to 4, where the students are with one assigned  teacher that is bilingual and provides instruction in the language of the day. The model follow a specific  calendar that is aligned  with the literacy writing pacing charts for grades Kg. to 4th grade.  In grades 5  through 8 the language is divided by time and by teacher.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84         For students that are new to the language we have them focus on their dominant language 1st and slowly  incorporate skill and strategies that are in line with the curriculum and the literacy genera but being  mindful of incorporating language structures and scaffolds that will help make the lesson  more  comprehensible for the students.  In 5th grade we have a side by side model, where one fifth grade  teacher teaches Science and Math and the other fifth grade teacher teaches Literacy and Social Studies.  In  grades 6-8 the language model is then structured by teacher assignment, time and curriculum in a 50%  / 50% Spanish/English model, where teachers are scheduled to give their content in an assigned  language.  I.e. Humanities (Literacy/Social Studies) Spanish and Humanities (Literacy and Social Studies  teacher in English).        Students with special needs are primarily in ICT classes where the teachers are licensed in Bilingual  Education and Special Education.  In the MS grade we try as much as possible to hire Special Ed teachers  that are also licensed in the content area that they will be assigned to teach.  For students with an  individualized education plan (IEP) we have a setts teacher, Bilingual speech teacher and more.  Similar to  the ENL program, students could be pulled out or the ENL teachers can push in.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Provide a detailed description of professional development program and activities.      Through weekly study groups meetings and workshops that teachers attend. Professional development is provided to all staff  on a bi-weekly bases throughout the year and on the three Chancellor Professional Development days.  Also when the budget  permits we provide the teachers with Summer institutes where they can come in a week earlier to do planning. We also  provide teachers with Study Group and planning time for two periods every week where they work with a ELA or Math coach  where they do activities such as: (a) align curriculum with the standards, (b) look at student work and discuss the progress and  or needs of  individual students with the group; (c) identify the students' strengths and needs and develop next steps for  grouping and planning; (d) Analyze student performnce in standardize test and scheduled interim in order to do child study  exercises that help us to tweak our curriculum to better fit our school needs. We also divide the staff in grade cohorts during  study group where the staff is divided by grades as early childhood, elementary and middle school.  In the middle school we  meet together as a MS unit to discuss area of needs for all the students once a month and in the different ELA, Math and  Science cohorts.  This year we have also differentiated the Monday PLC  further by having the teachers choose to focus on  literacy, Science or Math on a 6-8 week bases to provide more input by the teachers as to the area that they want to focus  on.  After the cycle the teacher present what they have learned with the entire Monday PLC community. Teachers also work in  teacher teams to discuss day to day activities that conform to what is going on in the classrooms.  They share their in sites on  students work and strategies for working with students. The teachers are also encouraged to attend workshop and institutes  that can be of help to them in developing in their different areas of need as well as responding to their different interest. (I.e.  Bank Street Language Series; Math weekend workshops, DELL workshops.)     The teachers work together to address student needs as far as Learning a second language, working with students that have  special needs and moving all our students from one level to another.  By aligning the curriculum to the New State Common  Core Standards where we look to incorporate reading and writing throughout all the curriculum areas, we work to have a more  rigorous curriculum that includes the development of language functions with Blooms taxonomy and or DOK chart in mind;  and, language structures that assist the students in scaffolding the writing in either languages.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85         Teachers focus their Study group time on how to plan for students with the Common core standards in mind, and on how to  group students to better meet their individual needs by grouping them by achievement levels, language proficiency and  interest.  Students are identify and assessed for performance in order to determine if they are below, at or above grade  level.  By doing this the teachers are able to plan differentiated lessons for them.  The teachers also develop lessons with  language functions and structures that scaffold learning for the students.      Calendar of events.  November & June Chancellor’s professional development day.  We provide weekly Study Group meetings  with teachers where student work is looked at and discussed, teaching strategies are demonstrated and next steps for student  achievement are planned.  Teachers also participate in walk-through of each other classrooms.  They are video taped for  sharing of best practices and for self reflection.      During the teachers Study Group time teachers spend time reviewing data that is reflective of where their students are in their  stage of language development and then use this inquiry information to develop UDL- Universal Design for learning lessons  that both challenge and scaffold students' learning. And allows for different entry points of understanding. I.e. Pictures; videos,  TPR (Total physical response) strategies.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Study groups that focus on vertical alignment across grades.  Bi-weekly study groups where we do inquiry work in the effort to  meet the needs of all students. Monday Professional Learning Communities where teachers present to each other strategies  that are effective.  Teachers are encouraged to attend outside workshops and trainings to be develop  effective practices for  their students and then are asked to turnkey the information to teachers.    During Study Group PD sessions an the Monday PLCs meetings teachers have the opportunity to discuss and  share effective  practices that can assist them in meeting the individual needs of their students.  Agendas and sign in sheets are kept on record  of these sessions.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the mandated parent orientation meetings and Parent teacher conferences.  We as a school provide parents  with scheduled workshops and conferences to discuss with the parents how our school works.  What our Academic and  Language Goals are; and, strategy workshops that they can attend to learn how to help their children at home.  In addition to  these general workshops teachers now have the Tuesday parent meetings where they can meet one on one with the parents  or where they provide workshop or orientation meeting on how to do math, reading and other skill building strategies; as well  as have individual conversations as to their promotion status; or, to just get to know the students social emotional likes and  dislikes from the person that know the child the most the parents.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We also include parents in a more meaningful way by having them participate in parent meeting and classroom activities that  can better describe the mission and vision of our school in a more meaningful way.  And by providing more transparency with  the day to day practices of our teachers and our school.     By conducting workshops and parent book clubs where they can see for themselves how our school develops strategies for the  appreciation of literacy, math, science and social studies.  And how these strategies can assist them in helping their children at  home.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86            By providing workshops on how to access their children’s information by giving they access to their child's student profiles  published by DOE.         By inviting parents to special literacy celebrations; annual school events where they are at the center of the activity.  I.e.  Parent book clubs sessions where students can come and visit their parents during their Fridays book club meeting, where the  students can see first hand their parents showing their appreciation of books, and their love of reading.  This year we also  included a parent writing club that was very successful and parents presented their published pieces during their end of year  celebration in the presence of other parents, staff and their children.      By include parents in annual events that are important to the students and school.  Events like Character Day, Tiger day, Book  Fairs etc. that are activities that allows them to participate in activities that are meaningful to them and  their children. And by  inviting them to attend the different staff conferences provided by the district i.e. Summer Parnet Academy (SPA)     By inviting parents to special literacy celebrations; annual school events where they are at the center of the activity     By informing parents of important conferences and events where they can learn more about Bilingual Education programs and  other strategies that can better help them help their children.  i.e. SABE conference        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    In looking at the data I notice that every year our school inches up in performance in the different standardized test particularly in  reading and math.  But what is most notable is how in many of the ICT classes our school has been able to compete in a positive  manner with the non IEP class by scoring in a similar way to the other grade and in some instances surpassing the the district and  the city especially in math.  And in how once student pass the NYSELAT they are able to close the achievement gap between the EP  students and in some cases surpasing them.    Another initiative we have this year is our focus on SIFE students who are in some instances lost but if given the proper  interventions i.e. afterschool, summerschool and Saturday tutoring, can actually catch up with the other quicker.                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Evelyn Linares, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS / IS 210                                                                              School DBN: 06m210  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Orientation meetings are conducted by the parent coordinator in November-December for families that show an  interest in our dual language program. During these meetings, parents are informed about our school philosophy,  policy and expectations. A tour is provided for parents to get a sense of the school environment and culture. The  parent coordinator highlights and key features of our school in both languages,           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      We will send teachers and parent coordinator to get trained on LAC training and then have it turned key to others  through the Monday PLC; Cabinet and and other staff meetings.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

In the beginning of the year and as part of the packet for any student that is newly registered to our school we will  include in their packet information on who is their Language Access person, who is the parent coordinator and copies  of the guides and forms that are translated.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Some of the mechanisms that our school uses to gather feedback from the parents is by word of mouth, at parent  meetings, and through parent feed back forms. Most forms come translated already from the DOE. If there are forms  like a child's IEP where parents request to have it translated, we send it out for translation services. Some surveys we  translate in house if necessary. We also look at the translation and interpretation unit inter-net page to see what they  offer.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94
