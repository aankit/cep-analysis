This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of the Special Music School is to provide schooling to musically gifted children through a combination of  highly structured instrumental training and a standards-based academic program. The school prepares musically  gifted children for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         The underlying philosophy informing the structure and operation of the School is the belief that music education for  gifted pupils requires:       1. Extensive opportunities to work with an outstanding instrumental faculty on a one-to-one basis,   2. A structured, sequential music curriculum,    3. Opportunities to perform before audiences,    4. A program of close interaction between general academic and musical studies.      It is our goal to see each child reach his or her maximum academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all Special  Music School students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in the context of a caring, respectful, and safe  learning environment.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Special Music School at Kaufman Music Center (P.S. 859) is a public school for musically gifted children offering  musical training, including private instrumental lessons, during the regular school day. The school combines intensive  instrumental study with a rigorous academic program, providing a strong foundation for a lifetime of music without  compromising academic studies. Modeled on the renowned 'special music schools' of the former Soviet Union,  Special Music School at Kaufman Music Center successfully ensures that music is a primary component of each child's  education.      Founded in 1996, Special Music School represents a unique public/private partnership between Kaufman Music  Center, a non-profit multi-arts organization, and the New York City Department of Education, which funds the  academic portion of the students’ education. The music program is fully funded by Kaufman Music Center through  private contributions. As with all public schools, tuition is free to residents of the residents of the five boroughs of  New York City. The music program goes from kindergarten through grade 12.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Last year K - 5 science teachers developed two curricular units aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards  which integrated engineering projects into these units. Last year 100% of our students completed the engineering  projects resulting in a 5% increase in student performance based on the teacher-created pre and post unit  assessments. This was the first attempt at integrating engineering units into our science curriculum.    After reviewing student performance on the engineering units and the curriculum units created, we identified large  gaps in science content as articulated by NGSS. We also identified a need for students to further develop their  scientific thinking through writing as well and the need for teachers to utilize differentiation tools for students who  struggled with content.    This year the NYCDOE adopted a new NGSS aligned curriculum (Amplify) that integrates not only engineering projects,  but teaches science through argument writing. We reviewed the adopted curriculum this past summer and decided  this program could greatly enhance the coherency of our science curriculum as well as develop our engineering units  in more sophisticated contexts, as well as add to our writing goals for students to increase rigor in the K-5 science  curriculum.

Over the course of the past year, visitation and scanning policies at MLK have been reviewed and debated by the  Principal's Council, resulting in the identification of significant variances in procedures for different schools and  significant time delays for visitors. Many parents have also commented that the wait time to enter the building  prohibits them from meeting with teachers and participating in the school community.   High School student feedback from surveys and Learning Collective meetings note the delay in student entry as well  as unwelcoming tone of safety agents and unclear procedures of the scanning process. Students also ask for more  opportunities to work with students from other schools on campus.    SMS has grown to become valued member of the MLK Campus community. Over the past five years there have been  several changes to support the growing need for security and safety for our students. Although the campus holds six  different schools with separate philosophies and attention to student life, we believe the campus can do more to  develop a student-centered, nurturing and trusting environment for families, staff and students.

After District 3 was identified as the most segregated district in New York City as well as New York State, all schools  were encouraged to investigate admissions policies for incoming students. Subsequently, the SMS SLT discussed the  decrease in diversity in our K-12 application pool. At the same time, a majority of the minority applicants in 2018 who  were accepted did not attend SMS. Our current demographics are 15% Asian, 10% Black, 9% Hispanic, 53% While, 0%  ELL. According to self-reported data, as of Nov 1 2018, 36% of applicants for Kindergarten are Asian, 8% Black, 47%  White, 7% Latino, 3% Middle Eastern. In 2017, 18% of applicants were Asian, 12% were African American, 50% were  white and 12% were Latino. The dissipating African American and Latino applicants are cause for concern and a closer  look at our admissions process.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In recent years, our focus has been on developing a school culture that is welcoming to families at the high school  level. We have had success in achieving this goal, as demonstrated by the 3.91 we received in the "Strong Family- Community Ties" section of the parent engagement survey. Now that we have a full K-12 program, we are looking to  bridge the gap between our K-8 program and our 9-12 program and to achieve a 4 in this category. Considering that  we are a music school, a whole school music event is a ripe opportunity to provide this bridge.   We are continuing to look at this trend as 50% of our eighth grade students leave SMS because they do not feel the  high school is a continuation of the K-8 program.    2018-2018 informal parent survey and PTA meeting notes reveal the one whole school music activity provided in the  past was widely praised as a successful community building endeavor.    2016-2017 parent participation on the School Survey was 66%. 2017-2018 parent participation on the School was  52%. The decrease of parent participation was significant.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Special Music School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Special Music School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our elementary school teachers use the DRA and the Scholastic Independent Reading Assessment to assess the early literacy  skills of our ELLs. In our secondary grades literacy skills are determined with various assessments including the SRI, time  writing assessments, regular essay assignments, running records, small reading group work and conferencing. We also use the  data provided by the NYSESLAT to determine proficiency in each language domain. We have clear insight into students  improving reading comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, grammatical structures, ideas and writing organization. The data  generally demonstrates that students acquire speaking and listening proficiency more rapidly than reading and writing  proficiency, with writing being the area of greatest need, particularly in terms of syntax and organization. We use this data to  inform our mini lessons across the content areas and in the standalone ENL classroom.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42   Data gathered from assessments is disseminated to all teachers of ELLs via team meetings as well as shared data folders. Data  is used to inform teaching supports for ELLs, and these supports are planned in weekly team meetings and regularly evaluated  in those teacher team meetings as well as in weekly Child Study Team meetings.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELLs are regularly assessed and monitored by the ENL and the classroom teachers. Summative assessments include a variety of  formal assessments such as midterms and finals, as well as end of unit performance tasks and the NYSESLAT. Other  assessments include, but are not limited to, NY State standardized assessments, teacher created Assessments, DRA and  Independent Reading Assessments, as well as science Labs and other classroom projects.  All students are expected to meet  the target criteria on these assessments and assignments. The success of our program for ELLs is formally reviewed at the end  of each marking period by the school administration and the ENL teacher using data gathered from classroom assessments.  Due to our small population of ELLs, student data is easliy aggregated for measurements of need and success.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative data gathered from assessments is disseminated to all teachers of ELLs via end of term teacher meetings. Data is  used to inform future teaching supports for ELLs, and these supports are evaluated in weekly team meetings and as well as in  weekly Child Study Team meetings.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All students receive quality Tier one instruction, which includes intentional vocabulary instruction with visuals and cross  curricular instruction to meet the needs of all students including ELLs. Students are regularly screened via classroom  assessments (both formal and informal). Schoolwide data is tracked and studied by our school based RTI team as well as by our  ENL teacher. Students who are not meeting standards as defined by the Common Core and schoolwide assessment standards  are discussed and followed by our child study team/ PPT. The ENL teacher is part of the PPT team. The team works closely with  the classroom teacher to appropriately differentiate and tailor instruction first as a Tier 1 approach, using research based Tier  1 interventions. The progress of the student is then closely monitored  by the  classroom teacher and a designated member of  the PPT team. After 8 weeks, the PPT team discusses the student's progress using evidence provided by the classroom teacher  and discusses the next necessary steps as per RTI protocol. Students who are not demonstrating necessary progress receive  intensive, targeted instruction by the classroom teacher/ and or a push in specialist at Tier two and Tier 3 levels. Progress is  tracked weekly, and reviewed by the RTI and PPT teams.             6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   By examining data from the the past three years of the NYSESLAT,  it is evident that the majority of our ELLs pass out of the  program within three years, after which they receive 90 minutes of integrated extension of services instruction by the ENL and  ELA teacher. Students tend to perform best in the speaking and listening subsections. After transitioning, students continue to  need support with academic vocabulary as well as with some more advanced syntactical structures and essay organization. We  currently have 4 ELLs, all of which are Expanding and 2 Extension of Services ELLs. Each of our 4 ELLs require further support in  writing according to their most recent NYSESLAT and NYISTELL scores. All of our ELLs are performing at or above grade level in  Math, according to classroom assessments as well as the Regents.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher works closely with the ELA and History teachers to coordinate efforts to support ELLs, particularly with  writing. This includes co-planning and shared writing folders and notes for every ELL. ELL writing is regularly evaluated through  the use of rubrics and teacher-student conferencing. Data gathered is discussed and utilized to create and alter ongoing  writing supports for ELLs, such as graphic organizers, increased conferencing, as well as shared and modelled writing.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Special Music School provides a stand alone ENL program which includes integrated instruction for all ELLs. ELL  students are typically grouped according to grade level (up to 2 consecutive grades together). In K-8, Beginning/  Entering students receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA, equaling a total of  360 minutes. Low intermediate/emerging ELLs receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either standalone ENL or integrated ENL/ELA, depending on need, for a total of 360  minutes. Intermediate/ transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either  standalone ENL or integrated ENL/ELA, depending on need, for a total of 180 minutes. Advanced/expanding students  receive 180 minutes of intergrated ENL/ELA, and Proficient/ Commanding ELLS receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA. These time allotments are on a weekly basis.     We have one ninth grade ELL for this 2016/2017 school year (Expanding), three ELLs  (Expanding) in tenth grade, as  well as one former ELL in 7th grade and one former ELL in tenth grade who tested out within two years and continue  to receive an extension of services. The ENL teacher provides integrated ENL instruction for 180 minutes a week to  our Expanding students in their History and English Literature classes. The students entitled to an extension of  services receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction by the ENL teacher and the content teacher.              b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA           2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 See question #1 for time allotments. The principal and ELL coordinator ensure that all students receive the mandated  time in the mandated areas (ENL or Integrate ENL/ELA).        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         All students at the Special Music School (SMS) are exposed to an interdisciplinary content-based balanced curriculum which  is anchored in the Common Core Learning Standards. SMS provides a student centered curriculum in its freestanding ENL  program. The ENL teacher provides sheltered English instruction to all ELLs and collaborates with the ELA, Humanities, Science  and Math teachers to scaffold the instruction in order to meet the individual language abilities and cognitive needs of our ELLs.  ENL instruction is provided in English only. Grade appropriate content material mirrors the content classroom and is taught via  the SIOP model, with a variety of scaffolding strategies. The ENL teacher ensures that the content is grade/age appropriate and  that the student is working both contextually and linguistically in his or her own zone of proximal development.  Exposure to  authentic texts, especially content-rich non-fiction, as well as the explicit teaching of vocabulary, syntactic forms, reading  strategies, writing strategies, and problem solving strategies help ELL students to meet the Common Core standards and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      local/state assessments. The ENL teacher provides multiple opportunities of guided and independent practice with reading,  writing, and speaking while using evidence from non-fiction and literary texts. Materials include trade books, Reader's theater,  short reading texts of multiple genres, Words Their Way and Vocabulary Their Way, Writer's notebooks, computers and  audiobooks. Student work is kept in a shared file as part of a portfolio of work and assessments that are used to inform  instruction.         The ENL teacher also collaborates closely with classroom teachers during Integrated Instruction to help unpack the content  that is being studied in the classrooms by insuring that input is comprehensible. Learners develop their four language skills  through Reader’s Workshop, Writer’s Workshop, project based learning, paired learning activities, access to the internet and  technology, presentations, and field trips, all of which are aligned to grade appropriate Common Core standards driven  curriculum. The ENL teacher works closely with the ELLs both individually and in groups within the classroom, and takes notes  regarding their work and performances, which is in turn shared with the content area teacher. In Reader’s Workshop, students  work with a variety of literature genres, including an emphasis on content-rich texts, through read-aloud, shared reading,  guided reading, choral reading, reader’s theater, and independent reading. Students utilize themes from their reading  experience in the Writer’s Workshop, where they write a variety of literature genres while practicing how to ground their  writing in text-based evidence while receiving well timed feedback during frequent conferencing. Writing is supported through  modeling, shared writing, direct vocabulary instruction, graphic organizers, writing templates, and the Writing Process.  Content and learning strategies are spiraled throughout the school year so that students have multiple exposures to concepts  and various opportunities to practice the learning strategies that have been modeled. Teachers and students work  collaboratively in the assessment process. Student’s progress is assessed through portfolios, writing journals, presentations,  student/teacher conferences, running records, and performance records. Students are introduced to and practice a variety of  learning strategies that will help them to meet the content challenges of the classroom and of the state exams. Students are  encouraged to monitor their own learning process/progress, and to be aware of the rubrics by which their work is assessed  and strategies that will assist them in becoming English proficient.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         The Special Music School is a multicultural and multilingual environment in which students have diverse linguistic  backgrounds. The ENL teacher meets with both the students and their parents to attain language profiles. during family  interviews. Following this interview the ENL teacher will ascertain whether the students are fully fluent in the home language,  and whether they are literate in that language as well.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a.     SIFE: There are currently no SIFE students. If we were to have a SIFE student, that student would receive an individualized  instructional program which involves a high level of scaffolding in each of the content areas. This student would also receive  individualized instruction during the school day and after school as well.    b.     NEWCOMERS: The ENL teacher provides intensive vocabulary, reading, writing, and listening instruction, all of which is  embedded into the larger ELA curriculum. The ELA teacher and the ENL teacher are collaborating closely to scaffold the  instruction to meet the specific needs of this students, particularly in reading and writing. Instructional approaches are  informed by the student's NYSESLAT and ELA scores, and ongoing assessment by both the ELA teacher and the ENL teacher in  the areas of reading and writing.  c.           DEVELOPING ELLs: Developing ELLs receive small group instruction, provided by the classroom teacher, the ENL  teacher, and other specialty teachers, depending of their areas of need as defined by assessment data. Small group ENL focus  instruction targets students’ language needs implied by the NYSESLAT scores. The ENL teacher and ELA teacher work closely to  maintain instructional consistency in both the ENL and content classrooms.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      d.     4-6 YEAR ELLS: These students receive individualized academic support both within and outside of the classroom. All of  these students receive small group instruction, provided by the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, and other specialty  teachers, depending of their areas of need as defined by assessment data. Small group ENL pull-out instruction focuses on  students’ language needs implied by the NYSESLAT scores. The ENL teacher and ELA teacher work closely to maintain  instructional consistency in both the ENL and content classrooms. The performances of these students are regularly monitored  by the Pupil Personnel Team (PPT).   e.    FORMER ELLs: Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction weekly. These students are regualry  monitered by both the ENL and ELA teacher and receive a high level of support, particularly with extended writing and tier 3  vocabulary.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   While we do not currently have any ELL-SWD's, the ENL teacher typically works closely with the SETTS provider to align IEP  goals and ELL goals and follow student progress. Students  receive the alloted time of ENL, ELA and SETTS instruction as  defined by their IEPs and Part 154 using flexible grouping and instructional models to best meet the needs of the student and  achieve individual student goals in the least restrictive environment. The ENL teacher and the SETTS teacher collaborate to  insure that materials are approriate for each students learning profile and zone of proximal development. These materials and  resources include differentiated texts, visual and auditory supports (including audiobooks), technology such as iPads, laptops,  smartboards, as well as online and application based tools and learning programs. Materials are shared with the content  teachers during weekly team meetings. Giving students a variety of presentation methods (audio/ visual) helps ensure that  students are able to comprehend the content according to their learning style, which is reinforced both visually and auditorily.  Differentiated texts and graphic organizers help scaffold learning and are provided as they are needed. These materials help  increase conceptual and linguistic input. They accelerate English language development by providing different access points for  understanding. Scaffolding improves linguistic output and moves students in their language progression and towards eventual  autonomy.               7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ENL and SETTs teachers all provide integrated instruction within the content classes as well as stand alone support as  mandated  by the IEP. Goals are tracked by the SETTs and ENL teachers, as well as by the PPT team.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All ELL students are continuously assessed using the benchmark assessments within each content area. The ENL and content  teachers also use the results of the Math and ELA state exams to inform their instruction. These assessments have tremendous  implications for targeting literacy and math concerns early on.  We address the diverse needs of ELLs through scaffolding,  differentiated instruction, as well as targeted interventions.  In addition to support offered by the ENL department, students  may receive needs- targeted small group math and ELA instruction both within the classroom by the ENL and SETTS teachers,  and after school by the content teachers. Due to our small ELL population it is easy to target the needs of every ELL.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Improvements for the upcoming year include providing each ENL student with an iPad complete with applications that will  support their language needs in each classroom.  We will also continue to build the ENL student assessment folders, which are  shared with every teacher of those students.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Special Music School provides a variety of school programs, such as homework club, peer tutoring, drama club, sustainability  club, game club, various book clubs and school-wide sports such as volleyball, track and soccer. Information about these  programs is provided in multiple languages. Student advisers ensure that all students are aware of the programs that are  available, and translation is provided by school based staff on an as needed basis. In addition, because we are a music school,  students are often chosen to participate in extra curricular concert series. The Kaufman Center music staff chooses these  students based upon musical ability. Our few ELLs are well dispersed in a variety of programs such as Sustainability Club,  Volleyball and Face the Music (concert Series).             12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLs include SmartBoards, the laptops, iPads, Foss kits, math manipulatives, blocks,  audio-books, listening centers, picture books, trade books, word walls, language games, pocket charts, writing folders, graphic  organizers, vocabulary charts, dictionaries, and various art materials.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Student comprehension is scaffolded through the use of native language texts, audio books, glossaries and translation  applications. Newcomer students are paired with bilingual students who speak the same home language, particularly in the  beginning of the year. Staff regularly utilizes DOE and school based translation services for parents, as well as for students  when necessary.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services are age and grade level appropriate. This includes all instructional materials. The appropriate of materials  is decided by the ENL and content area teachers. Materials are differentiated according to the students' zone of proximal  development.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ELLs are given equal access to shared resources such as science labs, the school building library, and the Mt.Sinai health and  counseling services. . Efforts are coordinated by the ENL/ classroom teachers as needed along with the teachers that monitor  those resources.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly arrived ELLs and their families are provided with a school tour by the ENL teacher as well as the Assistant principal,  parent coordinator and translator if needed. During the month of September, the entire school community participates  Curriculum Night, which provides opportunities for families to meet the teachers as well as the other families. New ELLs who  are enrolled later in the year receive extra attention and support from the ENL teacher while getting accustomed to their new  surroundings. In addition, all middle school and high school students, including ELLs, meet weekly with their academic  advisers. These advisers track their progress over the course of the year and assist the students in advocating for themselves  with the content areas as well as within the school community in general.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All middle school and high school students receive the mandated time of foreign language instruction (Spanish).               18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher will provide professional development seminars for all of SMS staff twice a year, which includes all  administration, guidance counselors, school psychologists, paraprofessionals,  as well as the parent coordinator. The ENL  teacher also provides ongoing support to classroom teachers of ELLs during weekly lunch meetings. The ENL teacher attends  these weekly grade level meetings to provide insight and instructional ideas for  teachers of ELLs. The ENL teacher also receives  ongoing professional development as provided by the District. School-wide professional development days for the 2016/2017  school year are November 8, 2016 and June 8, 2017.        The ENL teacher is invited to participate in regular PD for ENL teachers as provided by the District. In addition, the ENL teacher  partakes in school based PD and during which the Common Core Learning standards are unpacked and applied to curriculum  planning and reflection. The ENL teacher has regular classroom inter-visitation with other teachers, and receives regular lesson  feedback by administration (6 times each year).         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Support for ELL transition to high school  The school guidance counselor works closely with the teachers and families of students to investigate the best middle school  and high school choices for our ELLs. The middle school faculty explains the high school application process to students and  their families at an annual meeting. There is a bilingual translator made available at this meeting. The ENL teacher meets with  students and their families half way through the year to discuss their progress as well as this application process. In addition,  all middle school and high school students, including ELLs, meet weekly with their academic advisers. These advisers track their  progress over the course of the year and assist the students in advocating for themselves with the content areas as well as  within the school community in general. In addition, the ENL teacher meets with the guidance counselor to ensure that ELLs  are transitioning well and that their families are engaged in the transition process.       Professional development is provided by the ENL teacher twice yearly on a school-wide basis. All teachers work with literacy  specialists and attend weekly PD sessions on Mondays, 15% of which are ELL specific and involve presentations on language  acquisition, vocabulary instruction, making content accessible, scaffolds for writing and general differentiation. Teachers are  also invited to attend PDs provided by the district. In addition, our ENL teacher attends PDs as provided by the school and by  the NYC DOE Department of English Language learners. The ENL teacher receives 50% ELL specific PD. Records are kept in the  teachers' files at school.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Aside from the initial orientation meeting and regularly scheduled parent/teacher meetings, the ENL teacher meets annually  with all parents of ELLs to discuss the goals of the program, the students' language development progress, language  proficiency assessment results and language development needs in the content areas. Translators are provided on an as  needed basis as determined upon the enrollment of the student. Informal meeting also occur on an as needed basis. Records  of these meetings are kept by the ELL Coordinator.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Answer to #2 (above)   The ENL teacher meets twice annually with parents to discuss the progress of their students. These meetings have sign in  sheets which are kept on file.   In addition, Special Music School holds Curriculum Night, town meetings, publishing parties, and many student concerts. All  parents, including parents of ELLs, attend these events. Parents of ELLs are also invited to participate in the PTA, for which a  translator is invited as needed.           #3 - SMS provides ELL families with all school related information in both English and in the designated home language of the  students. Report cards, school information, and NYC DOE information is translated for the parents.  Meetings with parents are  regularly held with translation services available.  All SMS parents are actively involved in the education of their children. There  are regular school-based workshops and celebrations for parents during which bilingual interpreters are available for parents  of ELLs. All parents attend classroom publishing parties and are invited to chaperone field trips. SMS also holds a monthly  celebration of student work for students and their families every Friday morning at our Town Meeting. All parents are  encouraged to participate in the SMS Parent Association meetings.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Katherine Banucci-Smith, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Special Music School                                                                              School DBN: 03M859  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registering at the Special Music School, parents complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). The  student and the parent are interviewed in person or over the phone in their language of preference. The language  of preference is determined by Part III of the home language survey in coordination with the information given  during the parent interview. The survey and accompanying interview are administered by a licensed pedagogue.  Translation is provided by the school by a bilingual staff member when needed, or an over the phone interpretor.  The HLIS is then reviewed and the home language is determined by the certified ENL teacher. Information cards,  reports and surveys are provided in the preferred language. In the case that the document is not available in the  language of preference, the ENL teacher meets with the parent to go over the document using over the phone  translation services. The school also uses the the ATS report of preferred languages and the preferred langauge  indicated on students' "blue cards" to determine the language preferences of the parent community. Preferred  languages other than English are then entered into an ongoing school report, which is organized by grade and  shared with school based staff.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52       2.
