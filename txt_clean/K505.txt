The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview                  At FDR, we believe in creating a student who can think critically, support their fellow members of the community, be  technologically proficient and graduate ready for college and career. To meet that goal, we have developed 4 new  STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) educational options for students to apply to based on their  interest. Students are able to apply to our Programming/Robotics, Multimedia, Environmental Studies or Science  Research Program. As we continue to promote and expand our celebration of the arts at FDR, we have also developed  a new Performing Arts educational option. From their first semester at FDR, students will be programmed in their  chosen course of study, and begin their 4 year course sequence, where they continually deepen their knowledge in  their disciplines. These options will be supported by our partnerships with Microsoft, Touro College and others.                                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School is a large comprehensive high school with a diverse school community. To  provide the best possible high school experience and college preparation, FDR offers a wide variety of required  coursework, a multitude of elective courses, and an extensive offering of extracurricular activities and athletic teams.      FDR is defined by diversity. As a learning community, we celebrate the rich cultures within members of our family and  acknowledge that this is one of our greatest strengths. Our students come from more than 75 countries and speak at  least 59 languages. Many of our students have had interrupted formal education (SIFE) and struggle with literacy in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      their native languages. We have 2 bilingual programs in Mandarin and Spanish. We have also started a Dual Language  program in Mandarin.      Our school community has developed several partnerships to promote college awareness and readiness, including  Follow Us to Success which provides college insight for students and One Goal, which also promotes college  awareness in grades 11, 12 and the first year of college. We are also part of the first cohort of the New York City  Department of Education College Access for All, which will impact students in all grades. Additionally, FDR has many  college preparatory courses that are offered through our extensive Advanced Placement offerings, our College Now  program, a partnership with Touro College and we work to grow relationships with other colleges.      We are now offering a group of STEAM Ed-Opt programs in Multimedia Design, Programming/Robotics,  Environmental Studies, Science Research and Performing Arts. Here, students will have a full 4 year sequence of  courses preparing them for future study in there areas. This has resulted in an increase of almost 200 students list- noticed for FDR for the 2018-2019 school year. Last year, our register decreased, resulting in a budget reduction of  approximately $630,000. Our 2018-2019 register is projected to decrease by 71 students, which is counter intuitive  given our increased register. This results in both a reduced budget, as well as $200,000 in funding set aside for  register loss, which will make programming and hiring a challenge.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In addition to our 5 STEAM and 1 Tech Theater Ed-Opts, we are a zoned school with over 3,000 students registered.  Of these, we currently have over a 35% ELL population with an additional percentage of students who are identified  as former ELLs. Our students face many challenges as newcomers to our country and one of the major goals we have  is to create a sense of inclusion. We have currently revised our ELA/ENL instructional model and curriculum to better  align with college readiness and graduation requirements.      We have approximately 450 ISS students, 60 of whom are part of an Alternative Assessment/ACES program. These  students are not diploma bound, although we have historically identified students who have successfully transitioned  to a diploma bound program.     As a learning community we have the commitment of our staff to work collaboratively to improve student  achievement at FDR.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Last year, our focus was on using formative assessment to provide opportunities for instruction based on student  needs in mastering curriculum. We provided extensive professional learning, and have increased checks for  understanding as well as learning more about differentiation, especially in student choice of product and process. We  have seen increased formation into student groups during instruction as well as increased student voice.       Our formative data on walk throughs as well as feedback from the Quality review indicate that further work in this  area is necessary. Here, we need to work toward differentiation based on student needs expressed by formative and       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      summative data. This pedagogical need revolves around Domains 1 and 3 of the Danielson Framework, specifically in  student engagement and discussion. This year we plan on continuing our partnership with Generation Ready, other  vendors and leaders in our building to help teachers develop stronger skills in differentiating instructional materials  and developing independent learners by a consistent approach to skills and tools around Domains 1 and 3.      The implementation of Part 154, ENL education, has proved to be a challenge as we work within our time, talent and  budgetary constraints to develop integrated ENL Content area classes . For 2018/2019 we continue to work  consultants and with teacher leaders and our AP to improve professional learning and curriculum/instruction to  better serve our students. In addition, we have increased support in content-area classes, and modified our current  Title III program to better support students with tutoring, homework club, regents prep, etc.      Our One Goal program has been more successful, with a full class enrolled and to continue into 12th grade. This is an  advisory, college-readiness program.      Our graduation rate for all students, as well as subgroups continues to improve, with significant increases in the  graduation rates for English Language Learners, as well as credit accumulation for Years 1 through 3.

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   x   x               Part 1b.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Based on our Regents’ data, Quality Guide and our most recent Quality Review, the area for improvement are in  graduating our students college ready, with the ability to graduate from an institute of higher education in the  designated time frame. As 80-85% of our students are ELLs or former ELLs, the CC ELA regents presents a distinct  challenge, not only in achieving a college-ready score, allowing them access to 4-year colleges and universities.  According to the 2016/2017 School Snapshot, 22% of our students went directly to 4 year colleges, and 24 % went to 2- year CUNYs. This is a new trend of more students attending 2 year schools. Our College Counselor reports that due to  the Excelsior Scholarship, many students who would have attended other schools now find the 4 year CUNY and SUNYs  more attractive, and this is reducing access for our students. We would like our students better prepared to meet the  challenges of 4 year colleges. In addition, we find that students who do not pass introductory ENL classes and other  classes are more likely to drop out of school.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17      Our school-wide instructional focus is designed to provide students with skills and strategies to become independent  learners, equipped to tackle higher-order, stimulous-based tasks on demand or in long-term assignments by:   1- Providing PL to teachers on the incorporation of formative, low-stakes assessments which guide instruction   2 - Promote school-wide coherence among all content areas and all constituents’ beliefs about how students learn best  via teacher-leaders in teacher teams.   3 - Provide PL to teachers in creating and modifying rubrics, providing actionable, rubric-based feedback to students.   4-Incorporate Project-Based Learning, grounded in a STEAM curriculum.   5-Recognizing the learning needs and styles of culturally and linguistically diverse student and providing differentiation  and providing and removing scaffolding as possible via lexiled reading, implicit vocabulary instruction, and increased  practice in on-demand reading and writing..            This will be accomplished via feedback provided through observations cycles based on the Danielson Framework, as well  as in Professional Learning provided by the established PD Committee, Supervisors, and other teacher leaders within  FDR.      In order to promote teacher collaboration, the principal designed an SBO in consultation with UFT to allow the a multi- session, 9 period day, with weekly 45 minute blocks of professional learning and parental engagement. The professional  learning has been further defined to allow for common planning for teachers, specific, teacher developed PL and further  work around differentiation and assessment.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?      While students are in our building, they identify the culture of celebrating diversity and supportive environment as  strengths of FDR. Our graduation rate has increased from 58% in 2014/2015 to 58% in 2016/2017. This can be identified  as a result of improved programming for students regarding classwork, increased scheduling of Regents Exams, with  better tutoring support and our move to the LRE identified in the Quality Snapshot as 3 bars for the first time.   Our attendance has decreased this year, and we need to continue to work to improve in this area as well. When  students, are absent and do not earn a sufficient number of credits, they are more likely to sign out.   Historically, many students have had difficulty transitioning to high school, and struggle even more in 10th grade. This is  particularly true of ELLs. We need to focus on this subgroup of students, who are on track in 9th grade, and fall off-track  in 10th.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           23      We need to support our students in staying in school, or finding the best options for them to earn High School Diplomas,  prepared for college and/or career.   In addition, our PTA has expressed the need for more staff awareness and involvement in their efforts.

Teachers have identified the need for better programming to allow for common planning during the school day. In  addition, they have identified needing Professional Learning to support improved pedagogy in several areas in  Danielson, mostly in Domain 3.   The results of the 2017 Quality Review indicate that while there has been much movement toward structures of  groupwork, we need to ensure that the task is rigorous, the roles of the work include group aspects, and staff can  support students via intentional differentiation. To continue to progress we need to support teaching staff.   Scholarship report data,. as well as subroup graduation rates indicate that we need to focus on ELLs, Hispanic Students  and SWD, among others. Their needs vary dramatically within the same classroom.   African American students have been identified as not making sufficient progress on the Algebra Regents.

The findings in the 2016-2017 Quality Review as well as the Principal's 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 PPOs indicated that ,  Pedagogy and Assessments were areas in need of improvement due to inconsistencies in planning for higher-order  questions, assessing students for understanding to improve instruction and differentiating instruction to enable meeting  the needs of all students to provide access to coursework. This is a key component of college readiness and awareness.       While movement toward more student centered instruction has been evident, we need to continue in this area, with  the understanding of meeting the needs of the students in our classroom. This includes building the capacity of the  pedagogical staff in designing formative assessments with the goal of understanding and using gathered data to drive  instruction in real-time during class, as well as in designing future lesson and unit plans.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School has always created a welcoming environment for families, and takes advantage  of community resources to enrich the already diverse culture of the school and advance the civic life of our school  building.    While we have hired a parent coordinator and community assistants who speak dominant family languages, we still  struggle in consistently having having more than 5 non-executive board parents at PTA meetings. In addition, workshops  have been planned with minimal parent turn-out.   Current data indicate that we only have accurate phone contact information for approximately ⅓ of our families as  measure by the school messenger. In addition, while students are familiar with Pupilpath, and use it to check programs,  there is limited parent use of and communication via Pupilpath. The Parent Coordinator has developed a texting group  and sends information to parents who have signed up frequently.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           38      Although the atmosphere as evidenced in our School Survey Report is welcoming and fosters a feeling of belonging and  trust, and encourages families to freely and frequently engage with the school, there has been minimal presence  outside of specific college readiness/FAFSA events and Award Ceremonies..    While the school has adopted the use of Skedula/PupilPath, teacher use has been inconsistent regarding posting and  grading of assignments. Parents have stated that they would like additional outreach from teachers when their child's  grades begin to slip. In addition, teacher use of Skedula to report grades is inconsistent and there is no shared  expectation of when grades are entered and how missing work is indicated. Teachers who do not consistently enter  grades identify that there is no mandate to do so, and moreover, too few parents are registered on PupilPath to make  its use meaningful.   “While the school shares some data with parents, it is still developing its ability to inform p a r e n t s about student  learning in a way that will allow them to best support their children.”   The above statement has been a comment that has resonated with our school from a myriad of sources. Our Quality  Reviews, Developing Quality Review, Priority/Focus Quality Review, and DTSDE Modified Review have all made this  statement for an area in need of improvement. Reflecting upon the comments, we have found that this issue has always  been a paradox in nature, and has been difficult to solve.    However, as a school community we prepared a goal to address the need for our school to promote greater parental  involvement and communication in order to create a dialogue with all school constituents that is centered on student  learning and success.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54           Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;            Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.         In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

A challenge we have identified is helping these students adjust when they enter the school  year mid term. We are beginning an Orientation Newcomer class for Entering and Emerging  ELLs that will be held Tuesday and Thursday mornings, before school. Students will participate  in the program until they reach certain benchmark criterion based on oral communicative and  interpersonal language development. This class will also serve to meet the socio emotional and  needs of our “over the counter” newcomers as they adjust to life in a large comprehensive high  school.  We will embed advisory type services and curricular aspects into the course so that all  students who participate will develop a foundational understanding of NYC high school  graduation course and exam requirements, resources that are available in the school and a  network of adults that can be resources in the future. The course will also work to develop basic  communicative language in English. Part of this rational serves to retain ELL students with  Entering level English proficiency to help them develop traction and connections mid term, when  they enroll throughout the year.  The program will run from September – June from 8:00 AM-  8:45 AM for students that begin school at 8:49AM. The language of instruction will be English.  The teacher will be Ms. Erin Williams Maples. The curriculum will be developed by the teacher  and will include Passwords vocabulary, Achieve 3000, System 44, NYC DOE graduation  requirements one page handout, along with teacher developed activities and lessons to facilitate  development of BICS.  Students will tour the school and have opportunities to meet all the key  individuals that they will need to know throughout their time at FDR. Distinct, from daily  instruction, teacher created materials will be used in this Newcomer's program. The teacher will  collect both qualitative (attendance and feedback) data and quantitative assessment data from  low stakes, classroom based language activities. Students will be invited to participate in this  program based upon their NYSITEL level.   Regents Prep  Explicit regent exam preparation courses will run for 10 weeks, five Saturdays prior to the  January Regents administration and five Saturdays prior to the June regent exam administration.  Classes will run from 9:00AM- 12:00PM. We will host regents prep in Living Environment in  English, Living Environment in Chinese, Living Environment in Spanish, Algebra 1, Algebra 1  in Spanish, Algebra 1 in Chinese, Global History, US History and ELA.   All levels of ENL  students, included ELLs with IEPS, who are enrolled in a regents terminating course will be  invited to participate in regents prep courses. Teachers will be certified in the content area, with  bilingual or ENL license extensions when possible and/ or be certified ENL / ISS teachers.  Materials will include Living Environment Brief Review textbooks, make up lab materials,  Global History review books, teacher created materials and previous regent exams.

Classes will be in English with native language  support or in Mandarin Chinese or Spanish as described above. There will be seven teachers  scheduled for each session.    Homework Club/ After school Tutoring  Tutoring and homework assistance will be offered throughout the year beginning in October and  running through May. Teachers will recruit ENL students of all levels from their classes to  participate in tutoring or homework assistance. The rationale for the tutoring is to target students  who need additional assistance and to work towards credit accumulation and mastery of the  standards. ENL licensed teachers, Math and Science teachers from our bilingual programs,  Spanish Home Language Arts teachers and ISS teachers that work in self-contained integrated  ELA or with ELL ICT students will work in the tutoring / homework assistance program.  Teachers will provide supplemental resources to support the work done during the day but will  rely largely on the homework assigned to students in their classes as the basis of the materials  used. Instruction will be provided in English with Native Language supports as needed.    SIFE Advisory  SIFE Advisory is an in house name for a club that is run by Hector Cruz a Spanish licensed  Home Language Arts teacher. Mr. Cruz meets once per week with students identified as SIFE,  after school to both mentor and assist these students with their academic progress and socio- emotional needs. This club is part of distributed counseling and attracts many male, often  unaccompanied minor students that benefit from forming connections with both a teacher and  other students in similar backgrounds. Materials used in this program are both teacher produced  and distinct for this program and the assigned homework tasks that are used as part of daily  instruction. Students will be recruited based on scholarship and attendance data as well as from  information regarding their SIFE status and enrollment in TBE programs from ATS (BNDC and  RSFE) screens.     Saturday Literacy and Mathematics  Our Saturday Literacy runs over 10 Saturdays throughout the winter months, beginning in  January- April accounting for vacation breaks. Three teachers teach three distinct courses on  Saturdays. Ms. Frullo conducts ELA regents prep for ELL students leading up to the January  exam and between the January and June administration. The session dates supplement the larger  regents prep program and ensure that students have this opportunity every weekend that school is  in session. Ms. Frullo is a licensed ENL teacher, she uses ELA CC Regents exams as her  materials along with technology supports. The language of instruction is English with Home  Language supports, as needed. The sessions are open to all ELLs but target ELL students in  EES85, EES86, EES87 or EES88 ELA courses, as they terminate in the regents exam. Each class  is three hours, from 9:00 AM- 12:00 PM. Saturday regents prep materials are generated from the  NYSED database of archived regents exams.   Ms. Distelhurst or Ms. Maestre hold a Mathematics course as part of our Saturday Literacy/  Mathematics. Both teachers teach in English and Spanish and use home language supports as  needed. Coursework that is presented aligns with the standards of CC Algebra 1 and supports  language acquisition through mathematics. Ms. Maestre is dual licensed math and ENL. Ms.  Distelhurst is a special education licensed teacher. Each class is three hours, from 9:00 AM-  12:00 PM. Both teachers create their own materials that are distinct from materials used in the  FDR mathematics curriculum. We have graphing calculators that are used in the Saturday  Mathematics program.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Mr. Wilder holds a Saturday morning cartoon class during Saturday literacy sessions. He targets  Emerging and Transitioning ELLs that want to build on communicative English. Students watch  engaging cartoon programs and engage in small group discussions about the content of the  program. They then do low stakes writing tasks. Mr. Wilder is an ENL licensed teacher and the  language of instruction is English. Instructional materials are teacher created and distinct from  materials used during daily instruction.   Qualitative data captured during Saturday programs includes attendance and student feedback.  The mathematics teacher assesses the students accuracy and uses this quantitative data to plan  subsequent lessons. Students are directed to participate in the math and ELA portions of this  program based on regents and scholarship data. The ELA regents rubrics are uses to asses  students work in the ELA regents prep courses.                 rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             There is standing Professional Development afforded to the teachers of the ENL Department  including a consultant from Generation Ready, a partnership with Achieve 3000 and the  UFT Teacher Center:    Provider: Generation Ready  Topic:  Support teachers as they implement the provisions of the new CR Part 154 (especially  Integrated Co-Teaching), Common Core Standards, and the Framework for Great Schools using  multiple entry points and scaffolds for ELLs and SWDs  Presenter:      Participants: Title III teachers and all ENL/World Language teachers    Schedule: 40 days from Sept. - June     Provider: UFT Teachers’ Center Professional Development  Presenter: UFT Teacher Center Staff member  Topics:    Curriculum mapping, common core standards, questioning techniques,  technology and  instruction, differentiation, monitoring and adjusting instruction and assessment, student  engagement, academic vocabulary development, and classroom management    Participants: Open to all teachers    Schedule: Upon request during a prep period  Professional Developments offered through the UFT teacher center are of no cost to the school.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      Part C: Professional Development   Provider: Achieve 3000  Presenter: Romano Bergolotti     Topics:  Using Achieve 3000 to increase the literacy skills in ELLs and SWDs  Participants: 10 teachers    Schedule: September - June  Achieve 3000 training is included in the purchase of the student licenses.

Additional Professional Development Initiatives are as follows:  Equity Committee  Over the course of the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Academic school year and Equity Committee  will be formed as a way to turn key professional development to all teachers at FDR including  those that teach ELL students during the day and in Title III Programs. The rational and intent of  the Equity Committee will be to explore Culturally Responsive Pedagogy and best practices to  ensure equity and access for all. The Equity Committee will work with “Border Crossers” and  use Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain by Zaretta Hammond as a seminal text. The  Equity Committee will consist of 9 teachers leaders (one from each department), and a guidance  counselor along with AP of ENL and WL, Elizabeth Messmann and AP of ISS, Tameeka  McNeil, as well as Melanie Katz, Principal. The Committee will meet twice a month, beginning  in September 2018 and continuing through June 2019, and develop whole school PD  opportunities that will be presented to the staff at larger on Chancellor Conference Days and in  Department Meetings bi monthly. The committee will create three PD opportunities for all  teachers at FDR. The PD sessions will be held on election Day, January Chancellor’s Day and  June Chancellor’s Day.  Objectives and Topics to be covered by work with Border Crosses includes:  ·  ·  experiences of our students;  ·  classroom;  ·  Zaretta Hammond’s text will be used as a basis for exploring the best ways we create  independent learners and how we craft our assessment criterion and policies. Per session will be  provided for meetings that occur outside of the contractual work day.     Instructional Cabinet  Beginning in September 2018 an instructional cabinet will be created to move towards a self- sustainable teacher led PD initiative at FDR HS. The instructional cabinet will consist of a  teacher leader/ content specialist from each department. The teacher leaders will meet monthly  with Assistant Principals of supervision to develop a deeper understanding of best practices for  ELL and literacy across the curriculum. They instructional cabinet will identify common  practices that work and bring them to their bi monthly department meetings to turn key strategies  and engage in lesson studies. The instructional cabinet will also lead and serve as models for a  school wide initiative to inter visit Highly Effective rated teachers and to share best practices.  The instructional cabinet will consist of 10 teachers, representing each department. These ten  teacher will take their developed professional experiences to their departments, impacted all  teachers at FDR. The instructional cabinet will focus on literacy across the curriculum,  scaffolded writing prompts, creating tasks that align to and support achievement on the Regents,  NYSESLAT and LOTE exams, vocabulary instruction, and shifting from teaching content to   Knowledge of the history and definition of racism;  An understanding of how race and racism manifests in classrooms, schools and   Application of a racial equity lense to scenarios related to race and racism in the   Strategies for creating racial equity in our classrooms and school.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         Part C: Professional Development   teaching skills and content.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At FDR we have embedded various formative assessments into our pedagogical practice that are used to inform  both day to  day instruction and programmatic decisions. Teachers have a practice of using Do Nows and Exit Tickets and conduct frequent  checks for understanding throughout lessons. Writing assignments are created in alignment to the Part II and Part III of the CC  ELA regents and to the DBQ and Thematic essay prompts on the Global and US History regents. A baseline writing assignment  is given at the start of the term, in each class. A writing rubric that has been modified from the regents writing task is used to  asses the student writing and to identify an area of focus for each student. Students track their progress on a semester long       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      writing reflection/ tracker log. Teachers develop and utilize instructional strategies and groupings based on students needs,  identified from the baseline writing and subsequent writing tasks.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers meet four times per month, per their contract,  after school. Two of these meeting times are in collaborative  groupings of teachers who teach the same courses or who are teachers in the Transitional Bilingual programs. This allows  teachers to use tuning protocols, conduct lesson studies and develop cohesive and levelled assessments and classroom  systems.Teachers who co teach integrated ELA are assigned a Common Planning period as their Circular Six and use this time  to co plan, co assess and make needed adjustments to curriculum.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  During initial intake procedures we use the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, an in house developed Chinese literacy exam and content  area baselines, that have been translated by the translation and interpretation unit, to assess content area knowledge and  literacy levels to best determine programming sequences and placement into standalone ENL, NLA and TBE tracks. During the  term each unit of study has a mid unit assessment which is project based and an end unit assessment which is a writing task.  At the end of each term an in house developed final exam is given. In Integrated ELA and NLA classes these exams are aligned  to the reading and writing tasks of the Regents and LOTE exams. NYSESLAT proficiency levels are used to determine units of  study. Furthermore, NYSESLAT proficiency levels and stagnation at Entering or Emerging levels or regression of a level informs  student groupings. Students who regress or who maintain Entering for two consecutive years are grouped into sections of  standalone where guidance, and cross curricular supports are provided.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative assessment data is used to program students appropriately. The NYSESLAT levels are used to identify how many  periods of standalone Entering and Emerging students need or do not need weekly. If over consecutive years, students do not  move from Entering to Emerging level they are programmed into a course designed for students who exhibit characteristics of  SIFE learners, called "Learning for Life". This double period class incorporates hands on, targeted content area project based  learning, a math lab to reinforce mathematical skills and a two period per week advisory. Students who do not progress from  Emerging level, move from their standalone into a literacy focus standalone where students use formulaic writing instruction  such as the Hochman method to teach the writing skills needed for the regents exams. Our Integrated ELA classes are  programmed by grade and students are in a section based on their level; some sections have Entering and Emerging level ELLs  and others have Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs. At FDR we have moved to exceed the minimum requirements of the  CR-154 and have included additional integrated ENL support in other content areas. We currently have several sections of  Global Studies with co teaching, this is based on regents results and student need ascertained from data analysis and trends.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   According to the RTI Guide for Teachers of ELLS, "When fully and effectively implemented, the RtI model is designed to:    determine whether students are benefiting from an instructional program within a reasonable time   build more effective instructional programs for students who are not benefiting   compare the efficacy of different forms of instruction   design more effective, individualized instructional programs   reduce inappropriate referral rate   increase educational opportunities for linguistically and culturally diverse populations."       At FDR we have been evaluating the effectiveness of out program and have made adjustments for the 2017-2018 year. The  achievement of our changes will be monitored periodically throughout the term. One change geared towards at risk groups  was the creation of a 2 unit standalone course for students who stalled at the EN level. 17 students made no growth from the  Entering level as reflected on the 2016 and 2017 NYSESLAT. These students, along with other newly admitted students who       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72         made minimal gains from the NYSITEL administered in term one of the 2016-2017 school year will be taking a class using  System 44 and other project based learning and increased counseling opportunities. System 44 has an in depth data analysis  function, the piloting teacher has received training on this and we will be following up with future training sessions this  year.  FDR has increased out partnership with Good Shepherd and is working to reduce drop out rates. We realize that this  population of students represents some of our most at risk student body and believe that this programming will allow us to  best target them for academic and socio emotional needs. We are hoping the increased exposure to technology, and learner  led learning might increase attendance rates.     Sixty students stalled at the Emerging level on the NYSESLAT and will be taking a standalone ENL class which utilizes  Hochman writing techniques, regents prep and increased counseling.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The AP of ENL compiles the EDAT periodically throughout each term to pull and analysis relationships between data from the  RLAT, RESI and NYSESLAT modality reports. This data viewed through the lense of the EDAT and independently through  analysis of REDS reports, credit accumulation and growth with language proficiency  inform the continued implementation of  our program and curriculum. We have made shifts in the curriculum, have purchased the EDGE curriculum, Achieve 3000,  culturally relevant and levelled literature to use in Integrated ELA classes, and levelled texts for Science and Social Studies  classes. We have moved to end repeater classes for ELA and standalone and have shifted to keeping students with their grade  foe ELA but grouped into sections by level and have created courses for students who regress or maintain levels for the  standalone classes to better meet students academic and socio- emotional needs.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The Assistant Principal of ENL works with the Principal, the APO and other APs of supervision (Guidance, ELA, Science, Social  Studies) during weekly cabinet meetings and during one on one meetings to strategize changes to programming to maximize  student success. State of the School meetings, conducted by the principal,  are held each semester to share trends in student  data and to share large scale changes to school programming and new initiatives. Departments also have weekly meetings  where teachers can ask clarifying questions about programmatic shifts and their alignment to the school mission and vision.  These weekly departmental meetings allow some teachers to engage in action research and inquiry to analyze practice and  plan according to student needs and trends.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     For the delivery of standalone ENL students are homogeneously grouped based on their years of enrollment. Entering  level ELLs, who are promoted from a middle school or who enroll as new admits are placed in a double period  standalone ENL class, which is held daily. The curriculum is aligned to Common core ELA, development of BICS and  acquisition of cross curricular content. If a student does not progress from entering to emerging and remains at  Entering for two consecutive years or more they are are moved into "Learning for Life" a project based/ advisory  course that focuses on building skills, supporting socio emotional needs and works to engage this vulnerable sub       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73         population of our students. This course will be piloting System 44 in two sections and meets for 90 minutes per day.   Emerging students who are promoted from a middle school or who test at Emerging level on the NYSITELL are  programmed for one period per day of standalone ENL. The coursework supports cross curricular content, and literacy  strategies. If a student remains at emerging for a consecutive year they are moved into a course designed for long  term Emerging students. In this class formulaic writing, based on Hochmann and explicit regents prep aligned  curriculum are taught. This is a homogeneously grouped level class.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.       During the first year of enrollment at FDR, students in the TBE program receive their standalone ENL minutes, as  described above, based upon their level.  For the delivery of standalone ENL students are homogeneously grouped based on their years of enrollment. Entering  level ELLs, who are promoted from a middle school or who enroll as new admits are placed in a double period  standalone ENL class, which is held daily. The curriculum is aligned to Common core ELA, development of BICS and  acquisition of cross curricular content. If a student does not progress from entering to emerging and remains at  Entering for two consecutive years or more they are are moved into "Learning for Life" a project based/ advisory  course that focuses on building skills, supporting socio emotional needs and works to engage this vulnerable sub  population of our students. This course will be piloting System 44 in two sections and meets for 90 minutes per day.   Emerging students who are promoted from a middle school or who test at Emerging level on the NYSITELL are  programmed for one period per day of standalone ENL. The coursework supports cross curricular content, and literacy  strategies. If a student remains at emerging for a consecutive year they are moved into a course designed for long  term Emerging students. In this class formulaic writing, based on Hochmann and explicit regents prep aligned  curriculum are taught. This is a homogeneously grouped level class.     They also receive one period per day of native language arts instruction based on their placement in the course  sequence. Students are given the Spanish Lab and an in house diagnostic Spanish writing exam at the time of  enrollment to determine their Spanish proficiency level. We have NLA Spanish classes on all levels(FSS61- FSS65 and  FMS61-FMS66).  Entering and Emerging level students receive science, social studies and mathematics in the native  language, with English supports. Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs receive one or two content area periods per  day (science, social studies or mathematics) in the Native Language with English supports depending on their ELL  proficiency level and academic needs.          c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We do not have a dual language program at FDR HS.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      At FDR High school all ELLs, whether in ENL/ TBE,  receive one period per day of Integrated ELA instruction. Students are  programmed by their grade into Core English classes that are co taught by an ELA and an ENL licensed teacher. In 9th grade we  have a sheltered Integrated ELA class for students who are enrolled as first time students to the NYC DOE and score Entering  on the NYSITELL. Other students are grouped into grade based sections based on their NYSESLAT level; some sections have all  Entering and Emerging ELLS, others have Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding ELLS.    Entering level ELLS receive a double period block of standalone ENL daily. Emerging level ELLs receive a single period of stand  alone daily. These classes are taught by licensed ELL pedagogues.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      Students in the Transitional Bilingual Program receive a period of Home Language Arts daily. They also receive the double  period of Standalone ENL if they are entering and a single period of ENL if they are Emerging, daily. This is in addition to the  Integrated Core ELA class.  When programatically possible we have expanded additional integrated service into some Global Studies classes.     Home Language Arts, for students in our Spanish and Mandarin bilingual programs are offered once per day. Students take the  Spanish lab and in house writing diagnostics in Spanish and Chinese at enrollment to determine initial program placement. The  courses are taught by NLA teachers.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students enrolled in the ENL program receive content area instruction with supports. When programmatically possible we  provide integrated ENL in Global Studies. All teachers are informed of student levels at the start of the semester. All teachers  are provided an in house developed language progression chart to help them better understand what students can do at each  ELL proficiency level to help them better assess and tailor instruction to student needs. Teachers use visual aides, levelled  texts, graphic organizers, structured writing frames, collaborative groupings and other forms of differentiation in both product  and process.  ELA teachers develop common core aligned lesson plans, using grade level texts and their co teacher/ ENL partner identifies  language objectives for different level ELL students and differentiates assignments to ensure all students have access points.  Teachers in the bilingual program use the data from bilingual progressions custom report in HSST and the NYSESLAT data to  determine how much content should be presented in the Native Language and in English. These teachers also use visual aides,  levelled texts, graphic organizers, structured writing and collaborative group activities to ensure all students have entry points  into instruction.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     At FDR we have a very diverse student body and we utilize staff expertise and the translation and interpretation unit to help  us assess students home language abilities throughout the years. Students who speak Spanish as their home language have the  Spanish LAB- R as a baseline. We have an in house developed Chinese literacy exam and baseline exams in the content areas.  Students enrolled in the TBE programs that the ELE and the CRT, for Spanish and Chinese.  In addition, we utilize teachers and  para professionals who are fluent in several languages, including but not limited to Arabic, Bengali, Russian, Ukranian, Greek,  Albanian, Haitian Creole, Polish, Mandarin , and Spanish to assess students' understanding of content throughout the year.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status        For all ELLs we employ Universal Design for Learning as a tool and resource to support each students' needs for multiple  means of representation, action and expression, and engagement. We use this tool to assess how well tasks, resources,  assessments, and classroom environments support ELLs at all levels and to share strategies and accommodations with all  teachers. In addition, we work to provide students with choice and ownership to ensure self-directed, independent learning.  If students are classified as SIFE, all teachers are informed and provided strategies for use in instruction.  The ENL teachers  work closely with the students to help develop the students' phonemic awareness. We expose all SIFE students to small  chunks of grade level text and find age appropriate literature for ELA that has grade level content but appropriate lexile level  text. We also patiently help transition the student into a school setting and teach them the norms of school behavior.  Visualization and kinesthetic activities are the primary focus of their assessment. Content area teachers  use differentiated       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      assignments and assessments and all teachers on a team are aware of individual student goals. SIFE students, are largely  Entering level students, and are programmed for a double period block of standalone. During the first year the standalone  curriculum supports BICS development, and reinforcement of cross curricular ideas and concepts. If a SIFE student does not  progress to emerging for their second year of enrollment at FDR they transition into a double period block of stand alone ENL  that is project based learning. Teachers work with students to develop literacy and numeracy skills, provide a targeted  advisory curriculum embedded in the ten periods weekly and participate in experiential trips.  We also have a dedicated and  persistent attendance team that works hard and follows up to ensure these students attend school.    Newcomers are supported in all of their classes with native language materials, visual aides, bilingual dictionaries, alternate  assessments and assignments, and assistive technology. Extra time is giving to the students if they need it. Content area  teachers are aware of individual student goals, and reading and writing instruction is heavily scaffolded to meet the individual  student needs. If a newcomer enters at Entering level and is a 9th grader they are enrolled in a sheltered ENL program for a  semester. Their Integrated ELA class uses  picture books, such as "Separate is Never Equal", "Iqbal and Malala", and "The Boy  Who Harnessed the Wind",  to explore grade level themes with lexile appropriate texts. Students take a pre Living  Environment vocabulary course, and a sheltered Global History course that focuses on skill building. If newcomers test at  Emerging or higher they are not registered for the sheltered program but teachers work to ensure that their unique needs,  both academic and socio-emotional, are met.    Developing ELLS are provided scaffolds and differentiation in all of their content area classes to making material  comprehensible. Teachers use native language supports, graphic organizers, levelled texts, sentence and writing frames, visual  and media aides and allow students to demonstrate mastery in a variety of ways.       Long term ELLs and ELLs who have received between 4- 6 years all receive their mandated time. Accommodations are  provided to individual students as needed. During the bi monthly teacher team meetings, ENL teachers discuss and advocate  for students  with content and TBE teachers to ensure the needs of these students are met in all student areas. Teachers  collaborate on the instructional goals and plans. We have text books and materials in native language available for student use  and students who have been here for 4-6 years comfortably enjoy using both in conjunction. Teachers work hard to develop  appropriate groupings in their classrooms and we always rely on differentiated assignments and assessments.     ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT continue to receive ENL support in ELA for two years after testing Commanding on the  NYSESLAT.   Additionally, test modifications are provided for the required amount of time after an ELL passes the NYSESLAT.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     To support learning, teachers use UDL principles of differentiating instruction for all students with special needs especially  students identified as ELLs. Teachers use the following instructional strategies to increase student engagement and  understanding of the content:• Re-wording assignments in simple phrases.• Scaffold questions and activities to match the  student’s readiness level• Provide real life examples when discussing readings or concepts.• Provide students with test and  classroom accommodations such as having work or tests read orally, extra-time, dictation etc.• Model all activities.• Use  technology (Smart boards, Promethean Boards, & Laptop computers) to engage students in learning both visually  and   kinesthetically.• Provide other visuals (photos, pictures, gestures) to support academic work.• Provide simple graphic  organizers, rubrics, and templates to assist in completion of classroom activities.• Incorporate alternative assessments in the  form of projects, presentations, drawings etc.• Provide native language support to bilingual students in the classroom. •  Incorporate pre-reading activities to stimulate prior knowledge• Encourage re-reading of tasks/instructions.• Provide more  time to finish assignments/tests.• Achieve3000 & my On Reader to provide literature at students reading levels.• Orton- Gillingham Reading Program to work on basic reading skills.• Saturday Literacy Program to work on building literacy skills.•  Constant checks for understanding: "Thumbs up, down, sideways" and the use of Promethean Actiview specifically designed  for ELLs.•  Use of curricular materials such as UNIQUE, Attainment, and Equals for alternate Assessment ELLs. All of these       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76      programs provide students with hands-on manipulative. UNIQUE includes Common Core-aligned stories with visual supports  for various ENL levels.• Teachers create a student-centered learning environment. Group work and pairing activities are  frequently used. This enables ENL students to get help from their peers which will force them to use the English language on a  more consistent basis.  Teachers act as the facilitator, assisting students as necessary.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    ELL- SWDs with ICT on their IEP receive Integrated ELA with general education ENL students. Self contained ELL- SWDs receive  ENL service in a self contained setting. All of these courses are developed in alignment to the common core learning standards.  There is differentiation of product and process. Our school monitors students progress towards their IEP goals during IEP  meetings and during teacher collaborative planning periods and meetings. All students receive mandated testing  modifications, and bilingual paraprofessionals as needed to optimize success.              8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We are providing integrated ENL co teaching in Global 1 and Living Environment. We have also created shletered Living  environment course, SLS11 for a one semester pre Living environment course for students to acquire some vocabulary. This  course is designed for entering level ELLs who enroll with no foreign transcripts or academic records. Similarly, we have  created a Sheltered Global Studies 1 and Sheltered ELA (EES81) to meet the needs of this same subgroup. Teachers work in  collaboration with ENL teachers to develop project based learning, utilize guided reading and student centered learning  activities to allow students to acquire both content knowledge and academic skills while acclimating to a new school culture.     Through Title III funds  FDR offers a variety of academic interventions for ELLs, they are:  An after school Homework Club to provide support study skills, completing homework, managing time for study and academic  guidance. A Spanish bilingual Science teacher, a Spanish bilingual mathematics teacher, two other science teachers and math  teachers hold tutoring in our after school homework club;  We offer Saturday Regents Prep for ELLs scheduled to take Regents Exams, provided in 10 subjects by content licensed  teachers using TESOL strategies;  An ENL Parent Academy to empower parents and relatives of ELLs with the language ability necessary to help their children at  home;  A Saturday Literacy Academy for ELLs. ELLs of all proficiency levels and language backgrounds are invited to attend. We have a  a Mandarin Speaking, Spanish speaking and a special education teacher among the staff;     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will be implementing a program designed for our SIFE students, embedded in the Saturday Literacy Academy and the  homework club. Over the 2016- 2017 year we enrolled nearly 100 students over 17 who had no high school credits. We are  designing these programs to attempt to bridge the gaps and hurdles these students are facing as they work to attain credits  and acclimate to a new environment as young, often unaccompanied, adults.  We will be eliminating repeater sections of standalone ENL and have developed alternate coursework pathways for students  who either maintain a proficiency level with nor progress or who regress a proficiency level. We have also planned to revamp  the way students are grouped and programmed for integrated ELA to ensure that all students move along the course  progression in grade bands to ensure student groups are age appropriate and to ensure that all students are programmed for  the ELA Regents at the end of their third year with us in FDR.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77      This question does not apply to us.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and sports teams. There are advisory programs geared towards  specific language subgroups and taught by bilingual teachers.   Before and after school during the week, ELLs can participate in  the Homework Club and tutoring.  In addition, on Saturdays, ELLs can attend Regents prep classes in all disciplines, the  Saturday Literacy Academy, the Long-term ELL Saturday Academy, or the Instructional Support Services Literacy Academy.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We have recently purchased the EDGE textbook series from National Geographic to use in Standalone ENL. We have purchased  a completely new set of literature to use in integrated ELA which includes many culturally relevant texts and authors.  In  addition,  there are several carts equipped with word-for-word dictionaries to lend to students.  Each classroom is equipped  with a Promethean Board. The ENL department has four chromebook carts and one Ipad cart. Teachers have access to Achieve  3000 and Brainpop subscriptions.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As research indicates, students with strong academic skills in their own language tend to acquire proficiency in the second  language more quickly, and as required by CR Part 154 guidelines, FDR offers Home Language Arts to ELLs to develop and  maintain literacy in their own language.  Through challenging, high quality HLA instruction, ELLs make an easier transition into  the second language.   Home Language Arts is assessed through the use of baseline and benchmark writing, reading  comprehension, and other in class developed assessment data. Formative assessment data is collected for Do Now, quizzes,  entry and exit tickets, student and parent feedback. This data is in addition to data gathered on the Chinese Reading Test the  ELE, the LOTE and AP exams.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The AP of ENL works to align curricular materials with core academic content required for graduation. Students are grouped  into integrated ELA course sections based upon NYSESLAT proficiency. This ensures that Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding ELLs work with the same grade level curriculum used by the non ELL population. The sections of Integrated ELA  that contain Entering and Emerging ELLs use texts of similar themes but lower lexile levels or the graphic version of the text as  support. Video and media support can also be used to help ELLs access grade level materials.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    FDR HS is not a collocated high school.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We have a Summer Bridge program that we offer in conjunction with New Utrecht high School to help incoming ninth grade  ELL students adjust to the demands of high school ELA, reading and mathematics. We have a foreign student coordinator with  a compensatory time position to serve as a resource for students as they adjust to the new school. Our bilingual guidance  counselors work to identify new ELLs and attend parent orientation held in the spring for incoming 9th graders. During  Freshman Orientation students and their parents who are identified as eligible for ENL service participate in a session  facilitated by the AP of ENL which provides a point of contact and an overview of services offered at FDR HS.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently, Spanish and Chinese are offered.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We currently do not have a Dual Language program at FDR.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    FDR High School is committed to utilizing professional development to address student work, achievement patterns, and  curriculum that relate to every student and to utilize common planning periods (Circular 6 ) that are held daily to discuss  students’ needs.  Teachers work collaboratively to plan instruction that will lead to high student achievement. Grade teams  meet every day to collaboratively:    •Plan differentiated interdisciplinary curriculum and assessments;  •Look at student work to inform curriculum, instruction and assessments for all sub-groups;  •Examine student achievement patterns and differentiate curriculum, instruction and assessments to meet the needs of  individual learners;  •Plan Advisory  •Evaluate parent and student surveys to assess climate, culture, communication as well as curriculum, instruction and  assessments;  •Plan weekly intervisitations and walk-throughs of classrooms;  •Use Tuning Protocols, Critical Friends protocols and Descriptive Consultancies to share feedback on classroom practice,  pedagogical approaches, curriculum and classroom assessments as well as to assist in problem-solving.  To provide support to staff as they assist ELLs to transition from one school level to another, our ENL Coordinator plans  bimonthly meetings where teachers discuss instruction and assessment and collaboratively plan for each students' progress.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    As per our SBO, every other Monday PD session is held in departments. The ENL department, which includes teachers in the  bilingual and world language programs meets together. Meetings are facilitated by the AP of ENL/ and WL, Elizabeth  Messmann. Some meetings are co facilitated by our Generation Ready consultant. Topics include the Engage NY bilingual and  ENL language progressions, student centered classrooms, grading policies to reflect growth, differentiated classrooms, and  socio emotional needs of our ELL students. Additional opportunities offered to ENL and content area teachers included ENL  PLCs conducted by Ronny Rodriguez ELL CPS for Brooklyn South, writing workshops conducted by the NYC Writing Project  focusing on ENL writing and full day PDs offered by Pearson on SCIOP.      Staff outside of the ENL/ bilingual department participate in the SCIOP training on staff PD days. Additionally all       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79         departments have a PD in June 2016 on the language progressions and the linguistic expectations of ELL students at all five  proficiency levels. Our data specialist and the AP of ENL created a document with class lists matched to ENL level for all  teachers in the school and a component of IP conferences, post observation discussions is an emphasis on supporting teachers  with meeting the needs of our ELL population. FDR has purchased licenses for online CTLE courses that address the needs of  ELL students and the access is open to all teachers. Teachers are motivated to complete these courses for their professional  licenses.    .

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   When the NYSESLAT results are released parents are invited to meet with ENL teacher,  foreign student coordinator. During  this meeting all parents are given an overview of the student's score, movement towards proficiency , progress towards  graduation and supplemental opportunities available for students to enrich their learning. All meetings are tracked with the AP  of ENL on Google documents.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  FDR High School understands the importance of collaborating with parents and families to increase student achievement and  foster well-balanced young adults. We are committed to working closely with all our parents, especially of our English  Language Learners.  Through a spiral of communication that involves teachers, advisors, and our guidance department we  create authentic relationships with families that strengthen our partnerships.    In addition to regular parent teacher conferences, parents are invited to various events that describe the curriculum and  celebrate student achievement.  In particular, we hold a Multi Cultural Night which celebrates the diversity and strength of our  student body through presentation of student work and culture.  In addition, we hold College nights where the application and  financial aid process are discussed. Translation services are provided thorough use of bilingual staff and contracted  interpreters.    In 2017 we awarded 28 students the Seal Of Bilingualism. We have a goal of increasing this twofold each year. There will be a  parent event to celebrate student achievement. Parents and community members will also be invited to hear students defend  their capstone projects, if this was an aspect they needed to complete to earn the seal. We will ask parents to serve as guest  evaluators of low incidence languages and engage community based organizations in these efforts as well.    The AP of ENL and WL will conduct a minimum of three parent meetings each year (2017-2019) to provide an overview of high  graduation requirements and community based resources, such as community colleges, public libraries and civic and cultural  institutions such as the Arab American Association of NY, Atlas DIY and the Brooklyn Chinese American Association.  FDR works towards honoring bilingualism and bi literacy and encourages students to earn the NY State Seal of Bilingualism.  Over the 2016- 2017 school year we had 28 students earn the Seal. We are confident that during the 2017- 2018 and 2018- 2019 academic years we will more than triple that number. We are planning on hosting special awards nights and capstone  dissertation nights to all students to have their capstone projects assessed and presented to parents and community  members.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melanie Katz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Frankiln Delano Roosevelt H.S.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      A review of the school demographics revealed that of a total enrollment of 3,074 students, 1, 139 (37%) are  identified as entitled English language learners (ELL). ELL data is obtained and recorded as students are registered,  and maintained on Student Information Cards as well as maintained in Excel and Google sheets databases to be  used for programming and test accommodations by appropriate staff members. Information is continuously  updated and readily available upon request to reflect new admits and discharges. Through an assessment of  languages represented in the RHLA (Home Language Report) report in ATS, we found that the population at FDR  consists of students who speak more than 50 different languages. Only 693 (22%) of students indicated English as  their home language. We record the data from part three of the HLIS, indicating preferred language of       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           84      communication and disseminate this information to guidance, the parent coordinator’s office, community  assistance and teacher teams.           2.

During weekly email  bulletin, which is sent to all staff members, the phone number for the translation and interpretation hotline will be  included to ensure that all staff have ease of access to making phone calls home in the parent’s preferred languages.  The student handbook, translated into various other languages will be uploaded to the school website.

Care will be taken to provide all parents who are not able to understand English translation and interpretation  services necessary to ensure equal educational opportunity for their children. From initial intake when they first come  to our school, to parent meetings, workshops; and interviews with school personnel, parents will be provided  translation and interpretation services by school community members who speak their language and understand their  culture.   The Bill of Parents’ Rights and Responsibilities is distributed in the school’s top six languages and English at the  beginning of the school year. All school documents are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Bengali and  Urdu. Information on availability of interpretation services through the Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselors  are posted prominently throughout the school lobby, school hallways and the Main Office area. School staff has been  made aware of translation and interpretation services, and are able to guide parents and visitors to the designated  staff members and offices where services are available. Calls from parents who do not speak or understand English  are forwarded to the Parent Coordinator and/or Guidance Counselors who immediately contact the identified  interpreters to provide assistance. During PTA and Leadership Team meetings, parents attending are reminded of the  DOE website link that provides information on their right to translation and interpretations services. The monthly  Parent Newsletter, which is translated into Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Bengali, and Urdu, carries a permanent  notification of the availability of translation and interpretations services, as well as the notice regarding parents’ right  to such services.    All parent notifications, mailings, forms and documents will be translated in as many languages as possible. In addition  to the six (6) largely represented languages, whenever possible, written translation of parent notifications will be  done into other languages, such as Albanian, Polish and Uzbek. Translated documents will be kept on file, updated  when necessary and available as needed.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent surveys and feedback forms are distributed monthly at parent workshops. In addition, links to online surveys  will be made available on the school website. Mass emails, that are automatically translated into the parents  preferred home language,through Skedula will be used as well.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           90
