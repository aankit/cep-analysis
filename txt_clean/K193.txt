This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Mission of P.S. 193 is to ensure that all students successfully achieve academic standards, and social and  emotional learning goals, in preparation for college and careers, through rigorous and engaging curricula and  instruction, which prepares and motivates students to become creative thinkers, leaders and life long learners.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      At P.S. 193 we strive to acknowledge, encourage and celebrate students' individuality, diversity, talents and gifted  abilities, by providing vast cultural experiences in the arts, technology and science ensuring that every child has an  opportunity to be successful and showcase their talents.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At P.S. 193, we embrace our multicultural student community and families and provide differentiated services and  supports to meet the needs of all students in our school community. We are a community school servicing the needs  of general education, special education, English Language Learners and gifted (CIG) students. In our building, more  than 15 different languages and dialects are spoken. In addition, we have students from five out of seven continents,  children living both above and far below the poverty line, students of various faiths, students with various dietary  needs, students of various ability levels, students from one-parent, two-parent, and no-parent households, etc. – the  list of all the ways in which our school is diverse is extensive. Our school is also unique in that the majority of our  students do not live in the immediate surrounding neighborhood/community. Our school community embraces our  school's cultural diversity and celebrates school wide by honoring cultural traditions such as: Black History Month,  Hispanic Heritage Month, Lunar New Year, Multicultural Day and Woman's History Month to name a few.   We pride ourselves on creating a solid foundation for our students. We ensure that all students engage in rigorous  instruction to master grade level standards, skills and strategies by the end of the year in all subjects. We are  committed to providing our students with the tools necessary to prepare them for college and career readiness. Our  mission is to create learners and innovative thinkers, who will be the agents of change.   At PS 193, we have partnered with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. The curriculum provides students  with rigorous instruction which allows them to immerse in various rich literacy components, such as Reading  Workshop (Mini-lesson, independent/Partner Reading) Read Aloud, Guided Reading, Shared Reading and Word Study.  We also provide rigorous instruction in the Writing Workshop. Our students are learning the craft of writing as well as  the process of writing in a mini-lesson workshop model.   Math in Focus, is the curriculum of instruction in all grades. The program allows students many opportunities to  develop math concepts from the concrete stages and moving into the critical thinking stage to deepen their  understanding of mathematical concepts.   Passport Social Studies is the curriculum for all grades. It encourages students to make sense of the world in which  they live and make connections between core ideas and their own lives.   Amplify Science is a researched hands on based curriculum which was designed to shift students learning about  Science and to develop critical thinkers, using core ideas to develop student understanding.   The Home-School Partnership ensures the importance of parent involvement in each child’s education. Through this  partnership, school personnel and parents support the goals of providing a rich learning environment and a home  away from home where all students are treasured and safe. Every Tuesday, during Parent Engagement, all parents are  invited to meet with their child's teacher. Also, parent workshops are being offered to parents at that time, which are  aligned to our CEP goals and instructional focus.   We’ll continue our partnership with Healthy Kids, our After School/DCYD provider. This partnership enables us to  elongate the school day for roughly 156 students, and better serve our various student populations. We’re also  partnering with other local organizations such as Puppetry in Practice for our Pre- K students., and Madison High  School.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student population is vast, and which includes our ENLs, SWDs, and G & T classes across grades K-5. We provide  rigorous differentiated instruction that is appropriately matched to the specific needs of all learners. We utilize  technology, manipulatives, visual aids, enrichment, and targeted intervention services.    We offer After school and Saturday programs to support and target the ENLs and the students in the lowest third. We  offer project based learning activities to all CIG classes, based on a specific grade level theme. Each activity follows  with a culminating celebration of learning. In addition our CIG classes receive Spanish and music instruction, and we  also offer specialized clubs for CIG classes . Our CIG students are "Reading Buddies" to students in other classes, such  as; ENLs, and SWDs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our key areas of success for this past school year include providing a more supportive environment while  simultaneously building strong family-community ties. We increased parent participation on the NYC Learning Survey  from 34% in 2015-16 to 68% in 2016-17, in 2017-18 from 68% to 85%. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in  level 3 and level 4 infractions, based on the OORS data.   As of February, 2018 we have decreased the number of level 3 infractions from 32, in 2016-17 to 4 in; 2017-2018. We  have decreased the number of level 4 infractions from 25, in 2016-17 to 3 in 2017-2018. This year we decreased in  level 3's from 32 to 9.   Another element in which progress was made over the past year is Rigorous Instruction. As of February, 2018 we  celebrated over 50% of students reading on or above grade level as measured by the Teachers College Mid- year  Benchmark assessments. We will continue to incorporate Teachers College methodologies and practices with support  of a Teachers College staff developer.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Key Areas of Strengths:     We will continue to incorporate Teachers College methodologies and practices with support of a Teachers   College staff developer. We currently have a Social and Emotional 4R's curriculum, which is taught weekly in  all classrooms. We have seen a significant decline in suspensions as reported in OORS data. There is an  increase in mediation of students in resolving conflicts. We will increase training of Social and Emotional  Learning to all school constituents. During the Chancellor Professional Day, we included secretaries,  custodians and safety agents in our "Restorative Circles", SEL practices and training.      This year, our students engaged in mediation with their peers facilitated by administration, which encouraged   students to communicate their feelings openly and effectively in a safe environment. We will continue to  provide SEL training opportunities to students, staff and parents to ensure a safe, supportive classroom  environment.     We continue to raise our already high attendance rate to promote the importance of daily attendance as well  as the social, emotional and academic successes students receive from attending school daily and feeling safe  at school. We will continue to use the ‘School Messenger’ to inform parents of lateness as well as absences.  Within the Parent/Student Handbook, we have included a direct correlation of "great" attendance = college  and career readiness. Further, the number of days absent directly correlates to loss of instructional time in  months and hours. We will continue to incorporate ‘Monthly School Spirit Days to encourage student  attendance. We will celebrate with awards for ‘100% attendance days, classes,' etc. Students with 100%  attendance at the end of the year will be acknowledged and rewarded with a pizza party, to celebrate their  accomplishment.      During the week of Thanksgiving we celebrate our annual multicultural festivities for all classes. Parents are  invited to celebrate with their child's class and bring in a cultural dish to celebrate diversity and appreciation  for all cultures. Children and parents feel valued and respected by their child's teachers and students show  empathy and respect for their peers. We promote and support diversity. We serve a large ENL population,  and understand the importance of smooth transitioning for new language learners. Our school motto:  "Kindness Counts" is an expectation of all members of the PS 193 school community.     At lunchtime, our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade student monitors support their younger peers with lunch. We have  "Reading Buddies" in our kindergarten, 1st, 4th and 5th grade classes. Students read together as well as read  to each other. They learn how to develop their critical thinking skills and ask questions to support their  reading comprehension.  Students read independently throughout the day and during "Study Hall" when there is indoor line-up for 3rd,  4th and 5th grade students to developing reading skills, reading stamina, and a love for reading. We  acknowledge students for their reading practice by announcing their names over the PA system and by  rewarding them with "Reading Charms" to promote reading and celebrate their accomplishments as readers.    Our student council elections are coordinated by our 4th grade teacher. In October, the teacher coordinates a      5th grade assembly to introduce the roles and responsibilities of the student council. The teacher also   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19      facilitates the 5th grade elections, and meets bi-weekly with the elected student council members and  administration.     Parents as Reading Partners is a monthly event which we encourage parents to participate in to support our   students in the initiative to grow as readers.    Principal Performance Observations reflect that over 85% of our teachers have created a classroom culture of respect  and rapport in an effective or highly effective manner.

Key Areas of Strength:     Our school provides a welcoming environment for all families, we send out a parent survey requesting   parents interests, needs, and resources. We will continue our partnership with the adult/GED program to  enrich the lives of the ELL families.      Based on the NYC Learning Environment Survey 98% of parents feel welcome in our school community and   trust the principal.     We coordinate a "Family Night" in the Spring - parents are invited to come out and share in the arts, science,   and technology. We will offer and host Middle School fairs and presentations to support parents in  transitioning students into District 22 Middle Schools.      Our parent coordinator sends out weekly robo call messages to ensure all parents are aware of school events.   We had a huge turn out this past year at "Dad's Bring Your Child to School Day." We had members of the  school staff to host and provide important information to the dads.     Parents as Reading Partners- parents are invited monthly to come in and read a book to their child's class.    At our annual career day we foster partnerships with parents and community organizations to enrich the lives   of our community and students.   Key Areas of Need:     Our ENL parents need assistance with translators when meeting with their child's teacher.    Parents have difficulty with supporting their child with Homework in Reading/Math/ Writing.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 193 Gil Hodges School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 193 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and   monitor their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and   in languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve    outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and    other members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Saturday Academy targets immigrant students in an effort to  provide the additional support that they need as they transition into a new system.  Not only does  the program aim to strengthen student’s language proficiency, but it also strives to build  partnerships among students as well as the adults.  The parent engagement link intends to involve  families so that skills are sustained, while the professional development of teachers are focused  on using strategies to build literacy in a culturally responsive environment.   Students that are  invited to this program will benefit from the Language Power curriculum.  This supplement is  designed to build language proficiency through listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The  curriculum is differentiated to provide diverse learners with level-appropriate text sets that  provide rigorous instruction through high interest topics across a variety of genres.  Each lesson  introduces new content specific vocabulary in context and scaffolds the learning of new terms  through engaging activities. Language objectives are provided and assessed through interim  theme based performance tasks. There are digital formats available to accompany each text  which can be used across all four domains.  Audio is especially important as it aids in  demonstrating fluent reading. In addition, there is a parent engagement component that arms  families with the ability to reinforce English language development through practical  activities.  These Parent Tip resources are available in more than one language. This program  will be funded through Title III.   The program is available to students in grades 2 - 5 who are new to the country or immigrated  from Caribbean speaking countries.  A survey is also sent to classroom teachers so that they may  recommend students that fit the criteria.  The Saturday Academy is scheduled to begin on  December 1st, 2018 and run through April 13th, 2019; a total of 18 sessions.  Classes will begin  at 9:00 AM and end at 11:30 AM each Saturday.  There will be 1 ½ hours of literacy instruction  and an hour of Math instruction.  Assistant Principal, Mrs. Dindial, will supervise the program.   Mrs. Dindial will not be paid from Title III funds. She will visit classrooms to monitor the  program and will conduct observations.  Mrs. Dindial's schedule is from 8:30am-12:00am.  She  will supervise the students that arrive early and students that may be picked up late.  Attendance  will be taken each week to ensure students are taking advantage of the intensive learning  opportunity.  Students that are not present will be contacted via phone call and reminded of the  importance of attending each session in order to build language proficiency.    Students will be instructed in English by 1 license ENL teacher and 1 Common Branches  Teacher. The instruction will utilize ENL strategies and methodologies to provide content area  knowledge and academic vocabulary. Emphasis is placed on consistent improvement in  listening, speaking, reading and writing skills as per ENL standards. Based on the Benchmark  Reading Levels, NYS ELA/MATH exams, teacher conference notes,  and NYSITELL & NYSESLAT results, students will be grouped.  Educators strive to  differentiate the instruction of our subgroups based on their individual needs.  ENL staff  articulates with Common Branch teachers to plan classroom instruction.

A pre and post assessment will be administered to ascertain the effectiveness of the program as  well as to fine tune the instructional focus for individual students as well as the group. We  will group students of grades 2/3, 3 , and 4/5  with  no more than 15 students within each class,  based on the  results  of the periodic and formative assessments .  The students will receive  additional instruction in literacy and math, designed to help them achieve grade level proficiency  in these areas as well as utilize non-fiction text sets in different genres to enhance thinking,  questioning, promoting vocabulary development and discussion skills. In Math the students will  work on Math vocabulary and multi-step problem solving. The content area teachers will work  with the students on comprehension and writing skills and the ENL teacher will push in for 50  minutes for targeted language supplemental support and differentiation for each class.    We will target immigrant students on an array of assessments that include NYS ELA/MATH  Exams, Writing Samples, NYSESLAT scores, Benchmark Reading Levels and th einput of  Parent Coordinator engagement with families of English speaking Caribbean  countries.  Also,  teachers will periodically incorporate  reading and writing assessments based  on standard specific rubrics.  To evaluate students' progress in listening and speaking, the  teachers will converse with students and use a checklist to monitor student progress.

Parents need  to be reassured that their children are in the hands of caring adults that can empathize with their  transition and celebrate their contributions to the classroom. Interacting with families allow  teachers to better tailor instruction to effectively impact student achievement.  Building trusting  relationships with the families of immigrant children will benefit us in getting our families the  resources that they need.   Parent Orientation sessions and workshops will be ongoing throughout  the school year.  We will host a Parent Workshop on November 26, 2018 from 5:00-6:30p.m as a  NYSESLAT overview in order to help parents become more knowledgeable about  testing.   They will learn about four components of the NYSESLAT and how best to help prepare  their children for all tests.  We will hold parent workshops on Saturday's for the parents while the  students are participating in the Title III program.  The parents will be offered the following  workshops as well as workshops that are  based on their responses to the evaluation surveys that  they complete at the end of each workshop in which we request for them to inform us as to any  topics they would like us to present on to better support their children.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Commencing the 2016-2017 school year, we will be administering the Periodic Assesment for English Language Learners  provided by the NYCDOE  to students in grades 3-5. This assessment will provide our teachers with detailed information of  their ELL students English Language development.  In addition, we will administer Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark system ) 3  times a year (September, January and May) as well as a web-based I-Ready Diagnostic Reading Assessment. The I-Ready  along  with NYSESLAT and NYSITELL reflect that Listening and vocabulary are two areas that are in need of improvement. Through  frequent assessing we are able to progress monitor and make adjustments with instruction and academic intervention  services.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have 4 certified ESL teachers, who will administer the Periodic Assessments and support teachers in analyzing the data to  provide  targeted  instruction to meet the students' needs based on the data. The teachers have received Professional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Development and various resources to support the ELL instruction. We will also utilize the I-Ready Diagnostic Reading  Assessments to provide intervention services within the classroom.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Each program's success will be based upon its effectiveness in helping our ELL students improve their English language  proficiency and achievement levels both within the classroom and on standardized exams.  Such effectiveness is measured by  data gathered from NY State Exams, ELL Periodic Assessments, I-Ready data reports, the NYSESLAT exams, and our Saturday  ELL Academy.  It is our goal that 15% of our 154 ELL students will advance in their English language proficiency as measured by  these various instruments. Our program's effectiveness will continue to be reviewed as we examine current data to determine  whether or not we are approaching our goals for the school year.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ESL teachers and the classroom teachers will collaborate and plan instruction based on the data to ensure students will  advance their skills in English language proficiency.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school utilizes the NYSESLAT data to identify the trends within the modalites.  We will use the Fountas and  Pinnell Benchmark assessments to track each students' reading progress and the I-Ready web-based Reading Diagnostic to  identify trends within the 5 domains of reading (phonemic awareness,phonics, vocabulary, high frequency words and  comprehension).  Administration and Staff analyze the data to determine the academic areas in need of improvement.  An  action plan is implemented that includes strategies to support individual, group and/or grade level trends. For example, our  Tier I intervention may consist of use  the web-based I-Ready Instructional program, small group instruction, visual support  through graphics and/or realia, as well as auditory support through the use of listening center, web-based programs that  target the areas in need of improvement.  Through progress monitoring we take note of students that may need Tier II or Tier  III intervention.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In analyzing the data patterns, we noted that approximately 50% of our current first, third and forth graders (based on the  Spring 2016 NYSESLAT) fell within the Expanding Level.  We noted that our Grades 3-5 ELL attained slightly higher performance  levels in the reading and writing modalities than in the listening and speaking components.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We will have a Professional Development cabinet to analyze the data and to coordinate targeted instruction and interventions  to ensure patterns of deficiencies are being addressed with Tiered I interventions, AIS, Saturday and after school programs  etc...         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         For the 2016-2017 school year, we have programmed for an integrated approach across all grade levels.  We have 4  certified ESL teachers that will be pushing into the classrooms during each grade levels' ELA Block.  Our stand alone  ENL program (pull-out) will consist of 180 minutes for our entering and emerging ELLs and will be serviced by our full- time ESL teachers.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The assistant principal has programmed each ESL teacher’s weekly schedule to ensure that all ELL students receive the number  of minutes as mandated; 360 minutes for Entering and Emerging, 180 minutes for Transitional and Expanding, and 90 minutes  for Commanding and Former ELL students.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All instruction is in English using each grade levels' Common Core ELA Program; Across all grades we will utilize Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project.  A workshop curriculum/ balanced literacy approach is used where students are engaged  in modeled and guided instruction and are giving opportunities to work in groups and independently to master content of  instruction.  ALL ESL methodologies and scaffolding strategies are incorporated daily during instruction to build  comprehension and grammatical instruction in speaking and writing, in addition to, utilizing ESL strategies (TPR, pictures,  realia, bilingual dictionaries, etc.) to increase targeted academic vocabulary in content areas.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The Spanish LAB-R is administered to all entitled students with the Home Language code “SP”.  For the NYS Assessments, we  order copies of the Math and Science exams in various languages to ensure that those students who are literate in their native  language are tested accordingly.  If a written exam is not available in a child’s native language, we provide oral translation of  the test administered by a proctor who is fluent in that language.  Staff members who speak and are literate in various  languages help to translate and ensure that students are being assessed appropriately.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are students who upon enrollment were performing two or more years  below grade level in literacy in his/her native language and or mathematics.  Our SIFE students would receive small group  instruction as well as be recommended to receive Academic Intervention Services. Currently, we do not have any students  who are SIFE.    b.  Newcomers are students who are newly identified ELLs and remain ELLs for up to 3 years.  These students are not just  students who are Newcomers, but may also be students who are born in the U.S. but are identified as an ELL, based on the  NYSITELL data. These students will have differentiated instruction based on his/her proficiency level and or needs and receive  the mandated minutes required by CR Part 154 instruction according to results of the NYSITELL and or NYSESLAT.  They will  have Native Language support for 75% of instruction and be grouped according to same language in various activities.  They  will use their Native language to help develop literacy skills. Certified ELL teachers and or Certified Content Area teachers will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      incorporate ESL methodologies and various ESL strategies that include visual support, technology and a classroom rich in  print.  Our newcomer ESL Kindergarten students are placed in a general education class with a teacher who is knowledgeable  with teaching ENL students the strategies necessary in teaching the ELL students and they also have the ability to modify and  support the instruction based on the needs of the students.    c.  Developing Students are those students who remain an ELL for 4 to 6 years. These students will also continue to receive  his/her mandated minutes as per the CR Part 154. Differentiated instruction will be delivered by certified pedagogues in ELL  and or Content area. They will have small group instruction by area of skill needed. All instruction will have academic rigor and  be aligned with the Common Core.   d.  Long Term ELLs (LTE) are students who have remained an ELL for 7 or more years continuously enrolled in the U.S.  These  students will receive differentiated instruction through small groups and or receive Academic Intervention Instruction (AIS) by  a qualified pedagogue in the area/skill that he/she is not performing proficient in as indicated on the NYSESLAT.   e.  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status will receive half a unit (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ELA/content  area          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    It is important to consider the unique characteristics ELL-SWDs bring to the learning environment and to think about how  factors including their familiarity with and exposure to English, socioeconomic status, prior schooling experiences, and life  experiences, interact with and influence their learning. Authentic assessments should be used in addition to progress  monitoring to determine what students know and can do, as well as what they need to learn. As part of this process, English  language acquisition specialists should assess ELLs’ language proficiency and academic skills in English and their first language.  Special education teachers, psychologists, and/or speech language therapists may conduct additional formal and informal  assessments. Team members should   observe the child in different contexts to better understand the instructional environment.     ELLs with special needs receive grade level material that is aligned to the Common Core. We are currently using Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project for all grades. We use, 'Math In Focus', for all grades, which is a Singapore Mathematical  approach that focuses on moving students from a concrete to an abstract understanding of mathematical concepts.   Our ELL-SWDs are provided with plenty of visuals and technological programs such as 'I-Ready', 'Raz Kids', 'Imagine  Learning',  and 'Brain Pop' that are used in collaboration with Smart Boards, CD players,  Laptops/computers to provide visual  and auditory supports for their learning.  The ELL teacher meets with the School Based Support Team in collaboration with the  Special Education Coordinator and administration to make sure ELL-SWDs receive the correct ELL services. In some cases, a  Bilingual Para Professional helps the student in class throughout the day. The ELL- SWDs use the same materials and do the  same work as the mainstream students. However, the tasks and assignments are differentiated based on the student's abilities  and on the IEP. Some students may need simplified instruction and or have the task broken down into smaller  components.  Authentic assessments should be used in addition to progress monitoring to determine what students know and  can do, as well as what they need to learn. Special education teachers, psychologists, and/or speech language therapists may  conduct additional formal and informal assessments. Team members observe the child in different contexts to better  understand the instructional environment and the conditions the student seems to both thrive and struggle.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school is programmed to follow a 'Push-In' model of ENL instruction whereby the ENL teacher works collaboratively with  the content area teacher and supports the curricula with the use of ESL methodologies. The school is programmed to  incorporate the 25  th   teaching period as grade level as well as ESL/Special Education common planning. To facilitate flexible  programming, we incorporated block scheduling to facilitate main streaming of our ELL/Sp. Ed students.IEP teacher and the  assistant principal works closely with the coordinator, Larisa Beker as well as the ESL teachers to ensure all IEP mandates are  adhered to within the least restrictive setting.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    ELL students targeted in need of Academic Intervention Support (AIS) in the areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies  will receive a wide range of services.  I-ready is a diagnostic assessment that identifies the areas of strengths and weaknesses  within 5 domains of literacy.  Based on the data from the diagnostic, students engage in the instructional component based  upon their needs. The program  is tailored to the individual needs of each student. Imagine Learning is a computer based  program that addresses the four modalities, listening, speaking, reading and writing. Social studies and Science non-fiction  articles will be read, analyzed, discussed, and assessed by students within the classroom.  Teachers will choose reading  material to support topics already being implemented in classrooms.  Students will be serviced within Academic Support  Intervention programs.  Their academic progress will tracked by their ENL and content area teachers in collaboration.   Finally, students will be enrolled in our Title III Saturday Academy program.  Within the Title III program, students receive  specific academic interventions with a content area specialist and a highly certified ENL teacher.  Work done in this program is  focused on meeting the needs of individual students according to a variety of skill specific data reports.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Implementing a co-teaching collaborative program between the ESL teacher and the content area teacher. This year, we will  be including the 1  st   and 2  nd   grade students in our Saturday ELL Academy.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL students are programmed along side their monolingual counterparts for all access to school programs. All activities are  programmed according to their grade level. The programs that are available to PS 193 that are open to the entire student  population and their monolingual counterparts include but are not limited to: Happy Kids, Project Boost, Puppetry in Practice,  Shubert Grant (Arts Connection), After school Chorus, etc.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sheila Phillip, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Gil Hodges School                                                                              School DBN: 22K193  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are a various ways that PS 193 uses data to assess the school's written translation as well as oral  interpretation needs. We ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a  language that they can understand where possible. Data regarding the languages spoken in the home of our  English Language Learners are reviewed as needed on an ongoing basis. In terms of our new admits to the school,  our licensed ESL teachers, conduct a written interview completing the HLIS with and interpreter, if needed. An  oral interview is done with the student as well as with the parent upon admission to the school. The ELL  Coordinator keeps a running record of the languages spoken in the homes of our students. Our Pupil Accounting  Secretary, Karen Reala continually updates, prints and shares information from all available ATS reports. Our ESL  Coordinator, Larisa Beker continuously reviews reports such as, but not limited to, the RHLA, RPOB, RYOS, RLEC  and the RAPL. Our data specialist and our Assistant Principal transfers all pertinent data needed and keeps an  ongoing report on an excel spread sheet which is easily accessible. These reports break down the languages  spoken in the homes of all our students. In an effort to better support our English Language Learners and their  families, it is our belief that as much communication with language support should be in place between school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      and the home. Therefore, it is our belief that the families' needs of our ELL and FELL parents are paramount and  we are addressing their needs to the fullest extent possible, providing appropriate and timely information in their  Native languages in order to establish and maintain a home/school partnership.         2.

We  will continue to  make parents  aware of this  translation  service going  forward. In  addition, there  are staff  members that  are available to  assist with  translating  documents into  the parents'  native languages  (Ex. Spanish,  Haitian Creole,  Russian, French,  and Hebrew)  We will also  utilize the  services of  parent  volunteers to  assist with  written  translations  where feasible  and permissible.    Finally, we will  contact the NYC  Office of  Translation &  Interpretation  Unit via fax  and/or email  requesting  important  matters to be  translated as  well.

Administration has ensured that all staff members have received a notification of the Chancellor's Regulations A-663  that pertains to our school 's responsibilities and requirements when it comes to notification of parents in their  primary language, the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. The translated version are posted for reference by all staff  and parents on our school website. Interpretation posters are provided to each staff member in the building to help  parents request interpretation services by simply pointing to the interpretation request in their native language.  We've also provided each staff member with instructions on how to use the interpretation and translation services.  At-a-Glance flyers were created with the 800 number for these services and they are required to have the information  readily available for parent teacher meetings.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

The Bill of Rights has been made available to all parents in different languages. We have many  translated signs (and illustrations that assist parents with identifying the fact that the parent may speak only a foreign  language) displayed in the general office as well as in our school vestibule upon entry into the building. The signage  clearly indicates that there is availability to each ELL and former ELL parent that there are interpretation services to  ensure that the parent understands all of their rights and privileges as well as the availability of oral interpretation  services to assist with conversations and written translations. Our School Safety Plan also contains procedures for  parental notification and assistance should a parent or parents require to be in contact with our administrative  offices. Interpretation services are provided, when necessary and available, for ELL parents and it is important to note  that with the new Translation Committee that is being created, the parent involvement, understanding, and  participation will continue to increase through out the year.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We review the Framework for Great Schools Report, we create and review all of the exit slips that are provided to our  families and we will create surveys that ask our families to inform us of how we are doing in providing language  services here at P.S. 193. Surveys will reflect all necessary services that our parents may be in need of. Hard copy  surveys are also handed out and translated, where needed, at each school event.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74
