This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission statement reads, in part: “Egbert IS2 cultivates a safe, happy, collaborative learning environment among  students, teachers, parents, and support staff. It is a place where each student can excel academically and flourish  socially and emotionally.”       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9       In 2018, we entered our sixth year of participation in the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI). Through MSQI, the  focus is to assist students in developing fluency in a wide range of texts across the curricula areas while increasing  their reading stamina and comprehension. The “text diet” has assisted ELLs and SWDs in developing the literacy and  language skills needed to navigate through various types of texts – both academic and familiar. Various levels of AIS  are available for students, such as our SWDs and ELLS. In addition, we have teachers trained in Wilson Just Words and  Ortin Gillingham, which are phonetic sensory interventions. Students are placed in these programs after assessments  and data review . School based reading incentives "Read to Run Activity" are used as motivations to involve all  students of all reading levels to meet and exceed reading standard requirement A strategic reading/writing period has  been programmed across all content areas to support skills and strategies taught in ELA. All of the aforementioned  initiatives are fully aligned with our Instructional Focus.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Egbert Intermediate School is located in the Midland Beach area of Staten Island. The environment created by all  stakeholders in the IS 2 community has been able to help our families and community stay focused on student  achievement. Our goal is to prepare students to advance their education towards college and career readiness. To this  end, we will be participating in College Access for All – Middle School program for the third time this year. This  program is specifically designed for middle school students to introduce them to the college experience. This  interactive program targets 7th grade students and gives them a hands on learning experience about college. The  curriculum includes early college awareness workshops, family engagement events, college trips for students, as well  as professional development workshops for school staff and faculty. The College Access for All squad leaders will  conduct weekly lessons designed to support students and expand their mindset around going to college. In the 2017- 2018 school year our 7th Graders visited such colleges as: College of Staten Island, Bronx Community College,  Brooklyn Law, City College and Yale University. The squad leaders also provided workshops for parents and their  children which included a career panel and a financial aid workshop. The program concluded with an End of Year  celebration were the squad leaders planned a day at Citifield where they attended a College Fair where they were  able to receive information regarding the different programs available and afterwards attended a Mets game.       This is our third year in partnership with the United Federation of Teachers, participating in The Virtual Enterprise  Junior Ventures Career Academy. In the 2017-2018 school year our 6th, 7th and 8th grade Scholars classes  participated in the program. The VE-JV Career Academy is a three-year program that will enable 6th, 7th, and 8th  graders to develop technology and entrepreneurial skills by starting and managing business ventures. The Career  Academy will also engage students in fun and exciting competitions as well as after-school and summer activities that  build 21st Century skills in business, communication and technology. The VE-JV Career Academy offers a real-world  context for learning about business and careers. The classroom is converted into a workplace setting that allows  business thinking to flourish. Students will also apply and reinforce academic concepts across many subjects.      This is I.S. 2's second year implementing its STEM program. STEM - is a curriculum based on the idea of educating  students in four specific disciplines — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — in an interdisciplinary and  applied approach. Rather than teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEM integrates them into  a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world. Some common STEM areas include: aerospace engineering,  astrophysics, astronomy, biochemistry, chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, computer science,  mathematical biology, nanotechnology, neurobiology, nuclear physics, physics, and robotics, among many, many  others. As evidenced by the multitude of disciplines, it’s clear that STEM fields affect virtually every component of our  everyday lives. STEM is of the utmost importance because of the role these subjects play at multiple levels of society,  and the tremendous impact they have.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Continuing in the 2018-2019 school year, I.S. 2 will continue to build our Arts Department with the 3rd year  implementation of Drama. Through the use of The Blueprints for Teaching and Learning in the Arts: teachers  developed a curriculum in their art form, which provide benchmarks for what children should know, understand, and  be able to do in the arts at critical junctures in their intellectual, physical, and emotional development. In addition, I.S.  2 has shared with parents the potential their children have for achievement in the arts through the Arts Showcases  done in the Winter and Spring. The showcases consist of students fine arts work displayed throughout the school and  performances done by the Drama and Band classes.      Starting in 2009, IS 2 has maintained a true partnership with Urban Advantage, so much so that we are a “whole  school” participant. Each year our staff is provided with timely and effective professional development that is evident  in our science classes. Additionally, Urban Advantage Partners (American Museum of Natural History, Queens Hall of  Science, NY Aquarium and Staten Island Zoo) have worked directly with our students to increase their scientific  knowledge, expand their understanding and align our instruction with the Common Core and the New NYS P-12  Science Learning Standards. Not only has this strengthened the science classroom, but there has been an impact in  other disciplines as well. For example, math and ELA have been affected through the need to create logical arguments  based on facts and observable data.       During the 2018-2019, school year we will continue to participate in NYC FITNESSGRAM. This program is an annual  fitness assessment for students in grade K—12 that helps students and their families develop personal goals for  lifelong fitness. The NYC FITNESSGRAM reports spark conversations about eating habits and levels of physical activity  needed for good health. Parents and guardians can access their child’s NYC FITNESSGRAM results, and more  information about NYC FITNESSGRAM, on the NYC Schools Account. Physical Education teachers will help students  and parents understand how the test was administered; what the results mean; and ways in which a student can  make a personal plan for staying healthy and fit during IS 2's Family Fitness Evening.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Analysis of data reveals the need for academic vocabulary support within our English Language Learners, Student with  Disabilities and our lowest third populations      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   A brief review of the most recent accountability data for IS 2 indicates positive growth in closing the achievement gap  and addressing the needs of our students. The data reveals a 14% and 10% growth in achievement in math and ELA  respectively for all students. Moreover, IS 2 has met its targets for Student Progress, Student Achievement and  Closing the Achievement Gap based on the most recent accountability data (2017-2018 School Quality Guide). The  aforementioned initiatives center on Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment – all  leading to increased Student Achievement. It is our estimation that these programs/initiatives will aid us in building  on our success and move our achievement to “Exceeding Target”.    In the area of School Environment the 2017-2018 parent response rate growth from 46% to 53 % -- a gain of 7%. In  light of the 2017-2018 Survey results that indicated a an increase in the sphere of communication. IS 2 made it a  priority to develop a simple communication tool for the parents and developed a parent-friendly website through  Pupil Path. To assist us, we have acquired a professional developer from the Pupil Path program to work with parents  and students during our first Parent -Teacher meeting in September 2018. Ongoing support will be supplied by I.S. 2's   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Parent Coordinator and other support staff. PupilPath is a parent and student portal that allows parents, teachers and  students to have instant access to their child's class performance information. In the 2017-2018 school year, I.S. 2 has  purchased a Google Suite domain for teachers, parents and students to interact through programs such as: Google  Classroom, Google Drive, etc. . In addition, I.S. 2 has developed a Twitter Social Media account that highlights all of  the school communities accomplishments and activities. Therefore, we will continue to monitor the Survey results  and respond to the needs of our parents and community throughout the 2018-2019 school year. It is anticipated that  our actions will impact the level of family participation/communication and, ultimately, student engagement and  achievement.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R002   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   979   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     According to the 2017-2018 New York State English Language Arts Examination results, I.S. 2 showed a 10% increase  in scores of 3 and 4s in all grades. In 2015-2016, IS 2 had completed their second year with the “Read-to-Run”  program (a program designed to improve independent reading rates). The program was a joint effort between the  ELA and Physical Education Departments that required students to read seven books between February and May and  to complete book reviews/reflections. For the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue with the "Read-to-Run"  program and align similar goals to increase mathematical interests, skills and abilities in a new program called "Math  to Muscle." This program is being developed to increase our gains in scores of 3 and 4s from a 14 gain in the Spring  2018 NYS Mathematic Examination to a 2% gain throughout all 3 grades in the Spring 2019 administration. Students  who satisfied the criteria will be rewarded by attending a “Phys Ed – Math and Literacy Day” that will include a mix of  literacy, math and health activities all aimed at celebrating and honoring students efforts and success. This will be  supported by donations from staff, grants and community organizations to increase student interest and  participation. Using the data from the DRP and CCLS ELA and Mathematics Aligned Benchmarks - teachers will be  meeting during common planning periods to review the data and plan lessons accordingly. Teachers are scheduled for  inter-visitation within the school and given the opportunity for inter-visitation within the district. Teachers also  participate in common planning periods with their department and also cross curricular during their common  planning with their academy. This provides teachers with designated time to review, create and adapt  interdisciplinary curriculum projects on all grade levels.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

In coordination with our SIFSC, the achievement coach will  meet with instructional leads on a regular basis to provide  training and support in using student performance data to  plan instructional next steps. During these meetings the  achievement coach and instructional leads engage in the  following activities: developing facilitation skills, engaging in  problem-solving strategies to support teacher progress  towards the school's focus on Questioning and Discussion  techniques (Danielson's 3B), and support the instructional  leads in adapting common core aligned units, and support  inquiry teams with analyzing student work and identifying  strategies for struggling students. The special education  instructional specialist meets with lead teachers as needed  to support access points in common core aligned units of  study. During Common Planning periods, teachers will use a  standardized protocol, focusing on inquiry and instruction;  teacher teams will be able to identify student strengths and  weaknesses as well as instructional interventions that are  tailored to these needs. The school will participate in the  MSQI (Middle School Quality Initiative) to target students  who are performing below grade level expectations in ELA  as measured by the DRP . Students will be participating in  book clubs in the classroom and in the library, utilizing  eBooks that are available to the students and their families,  Strategic Reading Periods throughout all content areas,  access to School Library during all lunch periods as well with  ELA class visits. September 2018, I.S 2 will begin  participating in "Algebra for All" for all incoming 6th  graders, which will be implemented in all three grades by  September 2020.   The school will provide assistance to parents of children  served by the school, as appropriate, in understanding  topics such as the following, by undertaking the actions  described in the Parent Involvement Policy in addition to  the following: the State’s academic content standards; the  State’s student academic achievement standards; the  State’s and local academic assessments including alternate  assessments; and how to use NYC Schools Account to   All parents  and families  of students,  with a  concentration  on the lowest  third, SWDs  and ELLs   Monthly PTA  meetings, Parent  Workshops, SLT  meetings and  Parent  Engagement  meetings/contact   Instructional  Leaders, Teacher  Teams, Principal,  Assistant Principals,  Data Specialist,  Parent Coordinator,  PTA Leadership and  Parents.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      monitor their child’s progress.

In addition teachers will look collaboratively at student  work to support and strengthen best classroom practices in relation to the CCLS and student achievement.  Supervisory collection and review curriculum binders, learning walks, inter-visitation, looking at student work and  Mid Year Goal Review will monitor progress in this area. By January 2019, a 2% increase in student performance as  identified through the DRP would be the interim benchmark used by teacher teams to measure the effectiveness of  the activity/strategy; and whether additional support in using multiple data points to analyze data and differentiated  instruction is needed. This assessment is administered three times during the year. (September, February and June).  The CCLS-Aligned Baseline/Benchmark in English Language Arts and Mathematics will be administered in December  and in February. Quarterly benchmarks are implemented within Social Studies classrooms in all grades and shared  with ELA teachers to assure that document based strategic reading and writing is present in all classrooms. A constant  stream of data is also available from programs such as LightSail. Additionally, staff determined that a 5% increase in  library circulation would be the interim benchmark used by “Read-to-Run” teacher teams to measure effectiveness.      Part 5b.

A review of the 2017-2018 Middle School Quality Snapshot stated that 80% of the students indicate they feel safe in  all areas of the school and 59% state that most of the students in their school follow the rules of the class. OORS  reporting system has stated that our Principal Suspensions from the 2017-2018 has decreased from a total of 65  (2016-2017 school year) to 46 (2017-2018 school year), this represents a 30% decrease. In response to this data, IS 2  will be implementing a Positive Behavioral Intervention Support program (PBIS) to continue to improve the supportive  and safe environment, as well as School Administration, Dean, Parent Coordinator and school staff have been or will  be trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in Schools (TCIS) Certification. . PBIS does not focus exclusively on the  student, but also works to change factors such as school culture, interpersonal exchanges, curriculum and school  environment. Guidance Counselors will provide in-class workshop/assemblies for students addressing bullying and  institute a Bullying Awareness Day/Respect for All. By focusing on the contexts and outcomes, it is possible to make  the desired behavior (i.e., respect) the norm. To that end, I.S. 2 has a Debate Team, 8th Grade Student Committee  (e.g. Yearbook, T-Shirt), Student Government, CHAMPS, Library Squad, Book Clubs, and Junior Arista - which promotes  team building and leadership skills. Service credits are also earned by students who act as Peer Tutors, Monitors, Peer  Leaders, Fundraising Volunteers, Welcoming Committee and Volunteers to shovel snow for the elderly and various  community service activities. I. S 2's Librarian will continue to engage students in book clubs with a focus on books  that teach tolerance as a support to the PBIS program.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Common Planning has been incorporated into all teachers schedules to allow for collaboration with colleagues and  supervisors to engage in professional conversation about practice, student performance, trends and instructional  strategies to impact student performance. The most recent Quality Review, indicates that structures need to be  improved in aligning assessments to curricula and to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.  Therefore, teachers will use information gathered by formative assessments, DRP, periodic assessments, MOSL, etc.,  to inform instructional decision making including, but not limited to, grouping, instructional strategies and AIS. The  priority need is to ensure communication between all teachers in the I.S. 2 community (department, academy and  grade). The school has developed a uniform reporting procedure to document, track and provide actionable teacher  feedback from common planning sessions. Through the new Google Suite program, teachers will be documenting all  information discussed during common planning periods and have the ability to collaborate and edit in real time.  Administrators will have access to all information entered and make recommendations to support progress. The  procedure will be reviewed quarterly (or as needed) to determine its impact. It is anticipated that the use of the  procedure will result in increased understanding about the school’s trajectory towards academic progress by June  2019.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. George L. Egbert, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      George L. Egbert will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Current planning is for  three groups of approximately 16 students, flexibly grouped by using the data provided by the  most recent admintstration of NYSITELL/NYSESLAT with an emphasis on improving their  listening and speaking skills. Students will work in pairs, triads as well as large group  instruction.  The grade levels served are 6, 7 and 8.   The teacher to student ratio will be  approximately 1:5.  The language of instruction will be English.   The data sources used will be  NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores and benchmark assessment scores.    This will provide the  teachers with current proficiency levels and teachers will be able to tailor their lessons  accordingly.   NYS certified content area teachers working in collaboration with certified ESL  teachers will provide direct instruction.  This program is open to all ELLs, former ELLs, SIFEs  and SWDELLs (student with disability ELLs).  The program will meet for  2-hour  sessions.   Materials include dictionaries, props, costumes, art and crafts materials will not  exceed $2400.   Materials used are supplemental and distinct from those used in daily  instruction. The NYS certified Librarian works in conjunction with the ESL and Drama teacher  to provide support in the form of making both print and electronic resources available to  students.   Books include: Theatre Games for the Classroom: A Teacher's Handbook by Viola  Spolin, 1986, Games for actors and non-actors by Agusto Boal, 1992, Introduction to Theatre  Arts 2 by Suzi Zimmerman, 2007, Teacher's Guide for My First Acting Series, by Kristen  Dabrowski, 2008,ESL Teacher's Activity Kit, Prentice Hall.    In addition to the print resources listed above, five I-pad minis are available for students and  instructors for use.  Students have access to all of the digital resources on the I.S. 2 Library home  page:  http://library.nycenet.edu/common/welcome.jsp?site=1328.      The ENL teacher will maintain all records including permission slips and attendance each  session in a binder.  Program notifications will be provided in the preferred language of the  parent/guardian.    Students will be engaged in an after school drama program.  This work is designed as a theater  game workshop.  Theater –game workshops are useful in improving students’ ability to  communicate through speech and writing.  Under the direction of the ENL teacher and the  Drama instructor of the school, students will learn through a series of group interactions.  They  will engage in rhythmic movement games, sensory games, communicating with and without  words, storytelling and story theater. These activities are intended to strengthen their literacy  skills along with improving their receptive and expressive communication skills. Within the  theater workshop design ENL students will develop skills in concentration, communication, and  problem solving. All teachers will see the students become more confident and comfortable  participating in the classroom every day.  Academic achievement can be shown by an increase in  scores on the NYSESLAT and benchmark assessments.   Teachers involved in this program are  aware of students’ fear of participation and will engage students using games and group   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   agreements as a catalyst for involvement.

Currently the ENL teacher attends many professional development opportunities  provided by the SIBFSC. Topics to be addressed include: Implementing the SIOP Method;  Differentiated Instruction in the ESL Classroom; Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills; Reciprocal  Teaching; and What’s Different About Teaching Reading to Students Learning English?  These  two-hour PD sessions will  take place monthly.  These PD sessions will be the support of  the Instructional Specialist for each discipline.  The budget will allow for 4 teachers to attend  these sessions.  These teachers will then turnkey this information to other staff at another time.  These professional development sessions that teachers share with stakeholders in the school will  positively impact the progress of ELLs by providing all teachers additional strategies for  assisting ELLs. All agendas and attendance sheets will be maintained in a binder.   The  anticipated expenditure for this PD will not exceed the allocated 10% of T3 funding (4 teachers  @ 6-hours each @ $51.00 = $1,200 approx.).  Depending on availability and budget ("other  school funding sources"), teachers may also attend PD offerings offered by the SIBFSC and the  Department of English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLS).

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At present, DRP along with Fountas and Pinnell, Spotlight and teacher created assessments are used to assess the early literacy  skills of our ELL population. The most recent benchmarks indicate the majority of the population is performing at Level P/Q  (approximately 3rd and 4th grade level).  The implication here is that our students are performing two to three years below  grade level. Therefore, attention has been given to instruction that supports the acquisition of literacy and vocabulary to bring  this population up to grade level.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To that end, we have implemented the MSQI model to provide targeted intervention. MSQI is a multi-tier, interdisciplinary  approach to literacy instruction that focuses on language acquisition and academic vocabulary, debate, and the explicit   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      teaching of reading comprehension strategies - such as bi-weekly Word Generation reading on topical issues with an emphasis  on academic vocabulary. MSQI supports ELLs in literacy specifically by direct vocabulary instruction, sentence starters and  frames, accountable talking prompts.  The vocabulary is reinforced throughout the week in all major subject areas.  By  approaching a common set of target words across literacy, math, science, and social studies, Word Generation provides  students with multiple opportunities to experience the words in different contexts and develop a deeper  understanding. Reciprocal Reading employs four comprehension strategies to help students unpack informational text. It is an  instructional strategy where students and teachers engage in a protocol driven dialogue about a text in order to construct  meaning. Students read together in groups stopping to ask questions, make predictions, and clarify or summarize information  as a way of constructing meaning. This easy-to-master framework helps students develop a set of transferable reading  strategies that they can apply in all subject areas. The Frayer model is also used to assist ELLs in learning new vocabulary.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To assess ELLs I.S. 2 uses a variety of NYSCC assessments such as the Fall ELL Periodic Assessment to assess English profiency,  DRP to evaluate reading Lexile level, ELA and Math Fall Benchmarks, the ELA and math Spring Benchmarks, core content  baselines, and end of the unit tests.  Evaluation of the ELL program is handled in the same manner as the other subject  areas.  All content areas (ELL instruction included) follow a protocol for evaluating student work and achievement.  Through  the close scrutiny of authentic student work on baseline assessments, portfolio pieces, standardized rubrics and other  formative assessments, student progress is measured in terms of anticipated performance on these NYSCC Assessments and  the NYSESLAT. In addition, we use our ELL and ELA benchmarks and  and RAZ Kids ongoing assessments. These programs  get  real-time access to meaningful data about student reading behavior, comprehension, and growth so they can provide the  necessary guidance to enhance learning and encourage a love of reading.  ELLs have shown growth from the beginning of the  year as compared to the end of the year in all four modalities.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Instruction will be based on the needs of each individual student. Data from Lexile reading levels, NYSESLAT, ENL benchmarks,  DRP scores, and core content baselines  will be used to assist teachers in planning how the content will be taught, which  children will be grouped together and how instruction needs to be differentiated. Since we use flexible groupings, the teachers  change students in each group based on their skills and current assessments. Students who are proficient in listening and  speaking will focus on reading and writing skills. Those students who have not mastered listening, speaking, reading and  writing will spend more time improving in all areas. Goals will be set throughout the year to focus on areas the child needs  improvements in. The ESL teacher and classroom teacher will be involved in the process meeting and planning during their  common planning periods to implement scaffolds and strategies.  These interventions include peer tutoring, small groups, one  on one instruction, and conferencing.  Through observations, teacher inquiry teams will submit weekly reports to  administration to ensure the integrity and follow-through of necessary or needed interventions.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    I.S. 2 uses the RTI framework starting with the administration of the Home Language Survey completed with the ENL teacher  at registration.  With this information the ENL teacher is immediately able to uncover factors that my influence the student's  English language learning process (such as SIFE) thereby allowing this information to guide instructional choices. When school  begins, students are given a baseline literacy skill assessment (DRP) to see if the student is meeting grade level  benchmarks.  This is compared to the NYSESLAT that ELL students take in the Spring of the previous school year to measure  language proficiency.  If the student is flagged as at-risk or below benchmark on any particular skill or competency, he/she  receives targeted support by the ENL teacher in coordination with their content area teacher.  I.S. 2 provides strong core (tier  1) instruction both in the content area as well as during stand-alone ENL.  Students and teachers jointly construct knowledge  working in small groups and individually to foster communication skills and teamwork.  Students are participating in rigorous  academics and receiving targeted instruction at all times.  This includes small group instruction as well as one on one  support.  The teachers focus on language and processing skills using graphic organizers, glossaries, KLW charts, process charts,  chunking while reading, direct vocabulary instruction, sentence frames and starters, etc.  We also have a strong art program  that allows all students to know the world through musical thinking and spatial representation.  Where needed, some student   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         move on to tier III instruction for intensive and individualized instruction in a small group or one to one.  The ENL and content  teacher then reviews assessment to track growth and benchmarks.  Program recommendations are made as a team base on  assessment results and other influencing factors.  Students may then be recommended for programs such as LightSail, Raz  Kids, Achieve 3000 and peer tutoring.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   A review of the existing data indicates that ELL’s are scoring well on the Listening and Speaking portion of the  NYSESLAT.  However, the performance gains are slow in the Reading and Writing portion. Across the grades the majority of the  students at I.S. 2 fall in the Expanding (Advanced) level of proficiency.  Additional support is provided to all ELLs to increase  their Reading and Writing Score on the NYSESLAT in programs such as LightSail, EPIC Kids and Achieve 3000. In addition, ELLs  will have the opportunity to participate in I.S. 2's after school program which will be focusing on supporting Reading, Writing,  Speaking, Strategies and Vocabulary support to help them succeed in all CCLS State Examinations.  In mathematics,  the  students are given benchmarks at the beginning of the year to assess their current level. These levels are used to identify skill  deficiencies and create small groups.  In addition, end of the unit tests and portfolio tasks are given to track growth and areas  that need improvement.  The data shows that 70% of our ELLs scored a 1 or 2 on the NYS math exam while 30% scored a 3 or a  4.  To assist ELLs in math the school provides glossaries, textbooks in native languages, manipulatives, and native language  peer support.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Results of assessments, such as the NYSESLAT, NYS CCLS Assessments and DRP are disseminated to teachers, who use these  findings to generate a "English Language Learner Profile" that is shared with all content area teachers. The "Profile"  includes  their levels in all four modalities of the NYSESLAT and suggested Bloom Taxonomy tasks that students should be able to  achieve. Teachers use this information to develop their instructional groups and guide their instruction. In addition, the ENL  teachers meet during common planning periods with the ELA department to discuss ongoing needs of ENL students. The needs  of the students are discussed and strategies for ELLs including direct vocabulary instruction, repetition of directions, common  language, and the use of graphic organizers are included in lesson plans that are created during that period.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     The ENL instructional model being implemented at I.S. 2  will be the integrated/stand-alone model.  The ENL teacher  will be pushing in and pulling out throughout the different grade levels. All ELLs at the ‘Entering and Emerging” levels  receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week (180 Minutes in a stand-alone setting) and  ELLs at the ‘Transitioning  and Expanding’ level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week. Commanding students will receive 90 minutes  of ENL instruction. Students are programmed heterogeneously in our Integrated Co-teaching Classes (ICT) to address  the special education needs of our ELL students as well as our general education ELL students. Our ENL teacher will be  integrating into these ICT classes. The students who are not in these ICT classes, needs will be met in the Stand Alone  portion of our program.    Students at I.S. 2 are grouped heterogeneously by grade and travel together in blocks.  ENL students are placed in the  same class when possible in accordance to class size, IEP and 504 needs, and academy designation.  The ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         instruction model being implemented at I.S. 2 is a stand-alone/integrated model.  During the integrated portion of the  program the ENL teacher pushes in to an ELA classroom at all levels of English proficiency.  Entering and emerging  students are also provided with the stand-alone model in addition to the integrated portion and are pulled from their  respective ELA classrooms.  As part of the CR Part 154 regulations stand-alone groups are put in contiguous grade  bands of either 6th and 7th  or 7th and 8th.  All ELLs at the entering and emerging levels receive 360 minutes of ENL  instruction per week (180 minutes in a stand-alone setting).  ELLs at the transitioning and expanding levels receive  180 minutes of integrated instruction per week.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction per  week for two years after testing out of the program.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?            Using the results from the NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL ELLs are placed according to the requirements outlined in the CR  Part 154-2 Requirements. Once NYSESLAT scores became available in August, the ENL teacher meets with the programmer to  determine which students should be placed in the designated ENL classes, and which students also need to be in the Stand  Alone ENL class, as per their proficiency level. Beginner/entering level students receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL services  per week; 180 of those minutes must be in a stand-alone ENL class while the other 180 minutes are in an integrated ENL/ELA  class. Low-intermediate/emerging students must receive 360 total minutes; 90 in stand-alone, and 180 in an integrated  ENL/ELA and/or another 90 minutes that can be serviced in either stand alone or integrated (with ELA or any other content  area). Transitioning has a total of 180 ENL minutes; 90 of them to be within an integrated ENL/ELA and the other 90 can be  either in stand-alone or integrated with either ELA or another content area. Expanding ELLs receives 180 total minutes in an  integrated ENL/ELA or another content area class. Commanding receives 90 minutes of services in an integrated ENL/ELA or  other content area class. Once classes are created, the school programmer provides the ENL teachers with a schedule of all  sixth, seventh and eighth grade classes that contain ELLs. The ENL teacher uses this schedule to program their integrated time  according to the mandated minutes that they require. All entering and emerging students are also placed in a Stand Alone ENL  class. The programmer works closely with the ENL teacher and are in constant communication to ensure all students are in the  correct class, so all proficiency levels are receiving their mandated services. The content area teachers work with the ENL  teacher to modify instruction for their ELL students. The school leadership oversees the programming of the ENL program at  I.S. 2 to ensure that all students are receiving their mandated minutes.  The ENL teachers, along with the assistant principal,  create a schedule that adheres to the CR Part 154 and the assistant principal inputs this data into STARS.  Once the ENL  schedule is completed a copy of the schedule is placed in the ENL binder as well as the main office.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   At I.S. 2 we only provide the ENL program according to the responses on the Parent Choice Letter. The ENL teacher will be  participating in relevant PD regarding ELLs and will turnkey best practices with content teachers of ELLs. Academic language  development is planned in a variety of ways.  English  Language Arts and Mathematics classes are 90 minute blocks which are  specifically designed to address both reading and writing language skills and general mathematics performance.  Word work,  which includes vocabulary, grammar, spelling and usage, is incorporated into the double blocks to address the needs  demonstrated by students through ongoing assessment of both oral and written work.  They work with the target population  to enhance their understanding of reading passages and to assist the development of written language conventions.  Special  attention is given to basic language skills for these students, such as phonemic awareness, conventions for work endings such  as plurals, tenses and comparison, idioms, sentence structure parts of speech and dictionary skills.  Students are given time  during the regular class block to work on supplementary materials that focus on these skills.  ENL teacher also utilizes laptop  computers in the classroom to support learning.  In addition, all Entering and Emerging ELL students have access appropriate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      dual language dictionaries to work with. All ENL Literacy classes (general ed and special ed) are using a Common Core aligned  curriculum. During the Stand Alone model, ENL instruction is content based. All of the listening, speaking, reading and writing  activities are connected to the curriculum that is being taught in their Literacy classes.  The ENL teacher incorporates this  material into the ENL lessons during the stand alone period. Since the Stand Alone model is only used with our entering and  emerging ELLs, the ENL teacher targets any areas of weakness and uses them to develop lessons that the whole class can  benefit from. lessons are differentiated according to students proficiency levels and learning styles. The same ENL strategies  used within the integrated model are carried over to the stand alone model as well. Listening exercises and videos are used to  help develop students' understanding of more difficult content. Also, the use of technology is a large component of our stand  alone model. Using the SMARTboard makes the classroom interactive and makes the classroom student centered. It also gives  everyone a chance to participate in the activity. In the ENL stand alone classes utilize laptops to engage students in reading  and annotating articles through the use of such programs as Raz Kids, Light Sail and Achieve 3000. Core content is delivered in  both stand-alone and the integrated model using Next Generation Learning Standards.  Core content in the ELA integrated  portion of the program uses a Curriculum called Code X.  The classroom and ENL teacher work closely to deliver content.  The teachers use a variety of instructional approaches to make content comprehensible to the students.  Direction instruction  is used during mini-lessons to model the skills.  Interactive instruction, which is student lead, is used while students are role- playing, debating, conducting interviews, accountable talk, and group assignments.  Experiential learning is used to enrich  language through the use of games and role play.  Independent study is also used to while students are working independently  on various assignments such as reports and essays.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   At this time I.S. 2 offers only a Freestanding ENL program so no native language instruction is taking place.   We do not offer a  bilingual program because the ELL parents have chosen ENL for their children.  The school would open a bilingual or dual  language program if the parents requested the program for their child(ren).  The school is considering opening a dual language  program for the 2018-2019 school year for grade 6.  Students are given the opportunity to take mandated State Exams in their  first language if available or use bilingual glossaries.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For English Language Learners, we try to provide assistance in areas they may be deficient.  We have purchased laptop  computers, along with several computer programs, such as “Light Sail”, "EPIC Kids" and “Achieve 3000” which address fluency  and basic literacy skills that ELLs often lack.  Listening and writing skills are addressed, as well as answering questions about  instructional videos that require student response.  We have also purchased other instructional materials and supplies such as  audio visual materials, books with accompanying tapes, and stationary supplies to be used in the classroom.At the George L.  Egbert Intermediate School 2, a small number of our ELLs are SIFE students. For these students, we try to provide assistance in  areas in which they may have deficiencies, in collaboration with guidance counselors to assist their transition into the school  and classroom setting. We often use Iaptop computers, along with the computer programs listed above to address fluency and  basic literacy skills (such as phonics) that students with interrupted formal education often lack. Listening and writing skills are  addressed, as well as answering questions about instructional videos that require student response. We also use other  instructional materials and supplies such as audio visual materials, books with accompanying tapes, graphics, picture  dictionaries and stationary supplies to be used in the classroom. By using resources such as NYSESLAT scores, SRI, DRP, and  ELA/ELL assessment results, and ELL Periodic Assessment, we can see the strengths and weaknesses of individual students, and  plan instruction accordingly. To support ELLs in mathematics the students have glossaries and text books in their native  languages (Spanish) to help make the language comprehensible.  Teachers use the direct instructional model to teach the  mini-lesson and the interactive instruction model while the students are working in small groups.  In addition, scaffolds such as  process charts, manipulatives, and direct vocabulary instruction are used to improve performance and increase skill level.   We  have approximately 24 newcomers at I.S. 2 (0-3 years of service). We address their needs by doing the following: We always   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      invite our newcomers to participate in our after school programs. We offer computer and laptop assistance, where they can  use special software geared at increasing English language proficiency. (programs mentioned above) The independent reading  books are used within a guided reading group and also during independent reading time. Contact with mainstream teachers is  also a large part of our newcomer plan at I.S. 2. The ENL teacher provides mainstream teachers with training and ENL  resources, as well as specialized materials such as picture dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, and simplified textbooks related  to the topic they are teaching.The co-teaching model allows the ENL teacher the opportunity to take a small group of  newcomers for specialized mini lessons to teach the basics, such as ‘survival English’ for brand new students. We try to assign  a ‘buddy’ to our newcomers within the first week, which is a responsible classmate who usually speaks the same native  language. We always encourage our newcomers to write in their first language in the beginning of their transition in order to  reduce some of the frustration often felt when they are unable to participate in classroom tasks. They also are encouraged to  draw or make a story map to communicate what they are trying to express. We try to address the individual needs of our  Developing (4-6 year)  ELLs by utilizing the NYSESLAT data to find the strengths and weaknesses of each student. By using  resources such as the DRP, ELL Periodic Assessment, and benchmark assessments we can see the strengths and weaknesses of  individual students, and plan instruction accordingly.  Our 4-6 year ELLs scored mostly at the expanding level of the NYSESLAT.  However, Reading/Writing scores were lower than Listening/Speaking. We are continuing to utilize several instructional  interventions to address this, such as: 4-Square Writing Method, Frayer Model Vocabulary Instruction Strategy through Word  Generation,Scaffolding, Building Schema, Inferencing, Using Context Clues, Making Connections, etc. are used in both ENL and  Content Area Classrooms.Our plan for Long Term ELLs includes a variety of strategies. Upon closer analysis of their NYSESLAT,  ELA and Math scores, DRP, Benchmark Assessments we determined that a majority of our Long Term ELLs were testing at  higher proficiency levels in Listening and Speaking than in Reading and Writing. We are continually analyzing the NYSESLAT,  ELA, and DRP data to determine which specific literacy skills were more problematic for ELLs across the board. This will in turn  inform our instruction and test preparation to include more emphasis on those skills in our academic planning and curriculum  mapping. For all of our  ELLs, we utilize “Light Sail” and "Achieve 3000". These programs are a support for independent reading  for the Literacy classes to which the ENL teacher works with. The programs are an intensive reading intervention program that  helps educators confront the problem of adolescent illiteracy and special needs reading on multiple fronts, using technology,  print, and professional development.  The program meets the needs of struggling readers whose reading achievement is below  proficient level. It also directly addresses individual needs through differentiated instruction, adaptive and instructional  software, high-interest literature, and direct instruction in reading, writing, and vocabulary skills. These are skills with which all  our Long-Term ELLs seem to require the most help. Former ELLs are kept in their class with their peers, and receive instruction  from teachers who already differentiate the instruction for ELLs. All former ELLs receive 90 minutes of instruction from the ENL  teacher in their ELA classes. We also work with their guidance counselors, team leaders, subject teachers and assistant  principals to ensure they are transitioning smoothly. The former ELLs are also offered extra materials, resources, and supports  to the teacher of that content area if the need arises, and also gets the same testing accommodations. At I.S. 2 we have an  after school program this year. An after school drama program targeting ELLs will begin in January and run through May. The  families of the participating students will be invited to join with their children in creating the production. All parents will be  invited to attend the culminating event in May during I.S. 2's Spring Arts Showcase.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use a variety of instructional materials and strategies to support ELL-SWDs both in the classroom and during stand- alone instruction.  Grade-level materials include curriculum aligned textbooks, manipulatives, visuals, charts, graphic  organizers, and technology where available.   Instructional strategies include graphic organizers, process charts, prompting  questions, KWL charts to drive instruction, visuals, think-pair-shares, think alouds, summarization of the lesson to reduce  language demands, sentence frames, sentence starters, and direct vocabulary instruction.  The ENL teacher will be collaborating with content teachers and during common planning with ELA teachers. The ENL teacher  will be meeting with the ELA teachers during common planning periods so she may have access to curriculum and data  regarding student progress. Currently, we have several programs in place to help students in the core content area. There are  several opportunities afforded to all of the ELLs with a special focus on our long term ELLs. Students have access to various  different technological programs which are administered throughout the day during targeted instructional ELA periods. These  programs include: •    EPIC Kids is used with our students who have tested in the Entering and Emerging Levels of the  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT and also according to their DRP/FP results•    Light Sail is used with the Transitioning and Expanding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      students of the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT and also according to their DRP/FP results•     Achieve 3000 is used with all ELLs in various  levels of Language Acquisition.Data acquired from these program will also be used to drive instruction in the ELA/ENL  classrooms. In addition, Word Generation (an MSQI Vocabulary Acquisition Program) is administered across content areas and  across all grades.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are programmed in block schedules to accommodate mandated IEP services and the required number of minutes of  ENL instruction. A review of relevant data (SESIS and ATS) is routinely performed by members of the LAP and PPT teams to  ensure the student's program is aligned with their mandated services. ELL-SWDs are appropriately placed according to their  IEP mandates (SC, SETTS, ICT). ELL-SWDs are programmed for enrichment and elective courses in accordance with NYS  mandates and are grouped with non-disabled peers. The enrichment classes include drama, band, and art.  They have a choice  of academic academies for the year which include art, science and technology, or business and law.  There is also an after  school program called United Activities Unlimited which offers sports and STEM to students interested in participating.  In  addition, I.S. 2 also has a title III after school drama program.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All students are programmed 90-minute literacy and math blocks, and 45-minute Social Studies and Science periods that  incorporate ENL strategies in the content areas (i.e. glossaries and native language assessments where possible). Classroom  teachers collaborate with the ENL teacher to meet the needs of the ELL and are aware of the proficiency levels of the ELL in  their classrooms. While the language of instruction is English, certain instructional materials (i.e. textbooks) are available in  Spanish. For other languages, content area glossaries (where available) are provided. In addition, through the implementation  of MSQI, all students, and ELLs in particular, have the opportunity to increase their vocabulary and reading comprehension to  meet the demands of the Common Core Core Learning Standards.    Supplemental targeted intervention programs for literacy include Raz Kids, LightSail, and Achieve 3000.  These computer-based  programs target reading comprehension with high-interest reading passages.  The programs track and record data.  There are  also options to translate passages in other languages to make them accessible to all English proficiency levels.  For math and  other content areas small group instruction in English is used to improve skill level.  Peer translation, glossaries, and textbooks  in native languages (where available) are utilized.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will be continuing with the MSQI model and our AIS programs since it has proven to be successful with our ELLs. The data  from these programs have shown that ELLs have increased their Lexile level.  For this upcoming school year, I.S. 2 is infusing  social studies into the 6th grade curriculum to create a humanities program that integrates subject areas allowing for  continuity among classes.  Teachers are also incorporating technology into lessons to make them more engaging for  students.             10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs participate in school-wide programs such as Science Fair, Family Science Night, Foreign Culture Fair, Family Game Night  and all after school programs (i.e. United Activities Unlimited, Title III ENL/Drama Program). Through the use of block  scheduling, all ELLs have the opportunity to participate in Egbert’s Enrichment programs (i.e.  Instrumental Music, Drama and  Fine Art). ELLs are invited to participate through use of the School Messenger Service and Pupil Path and  which will provide  information in their home language. In addition, ELLs and parents are invited to various district run conferences during the  year.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All ELLs are using leveled reading material based on the F&P assessments. We have implemented Word Generation and  adaptive ELA materials such as CODEX and a literacy program from HBJ that contains targeted ESL lessons. In addition, cultural  libraries (some in native languages) have been purchased to assist in written expression among this population. Students are  supported with bilingual glossaries across the curriculum and work closely with classroom teachers in the content areas. The IS  2 Librarian/Media Specialist works with curriculum area teachers to provide technological support via the schools' library  website. ELLs are also able to access digital native language books in I.S. 2's Library with assistance of the Librarian. In addition,  teachers use a variety of materials to support all ELLs including glossaries, laptops for images and photographs, SMART Boards,  KLW charts, and graphic organizers.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Dual language books and cultural libraries in native languages are available in the ENL program and the I.S. 2 Library.  The core  content areas have textbooks and assessments in Spanish.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    A review of relevant databases (ATS, SESIS) is conducted and all ELL's are appropriately placed according to their age and grade  and performance level. Where required, ELL's are programmed for required support and services as mandated by their IEP.  STARS programming and the monthly EDAT report ensure that students are appropriately placed.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Students are supported with glossaries across the curriculum and work closely with classroom teachers in the content areas.  The IS 2 Librarian/Media Specialist works with curriculum area teachers to provide technological support via the school's  library website. ELLs are able to access digital native language books. Currently there are two schools in the building.  A district  75 program uses a wing of the 3rd floor.  I.S. 2 students have full use of the rest of the building and ELL students have not been  impacted in any way by the co-location.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   An Open House/Orientation is held by the ENL teacher and the Parent Coordinator  for all incoming students (ELL's included) in  June of the prior academic year. Students are afforded the opportunity to meet prospective teachers and parents are able to  preview the curriculum. In addition, parent meetings are held with  families of ELL's throughout the year for newly enrolled ELL  students. Parents of new ELLs are offered translation services through the free language line offered through the DOE (855- 249-9103 or 800-231-0288).  Peer translation is also available for incoming students to help them navigate and feel  welcome.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs can select from the two foreign electives offered at this time: Spanish and Italian.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teachers will conduct PDs with ELA and math teachers on topics that help ELLs succeed.  Topics will include direct  vocabulary instruction, accountable talking prompts enabling ELLs to use language with their peers, graphic organizers,  repetitive and common language, process charts, and other manipulatives.  In addition, the ENL teachers will turn-key  information from PDs given at the Field Support Office.  Professional Development is ongoing. Every Monday, there are  professional development meetings where teachers receive strategies and routines to implement into their instruction. These  PDs are usually given by the I.S. 2 Teachers and Administrators. The theme of the PDs depend on the feedback and suggestions  of the teachers. Teachers who attend workshops outside of the building are  asked to turn-key the information they received  to other staff members during this time. In addition, teachers are allotted time on Mondays to collaborate as a department (by  grade), to share power point presentations and lesson plans. This is where the ELA teachers are given time (also during  common planning periods) to collaboratively plan with the ENL teacher. It gives teachers of each department time to discuss  their plans and make sure they are all on the same page, and are covering the same curriculum topics. Also, every Tuesday  afternoon, after parent engagement, there is either a team meeting, grade meeting or department/inquiry meeting for all  teachers. This gives all content area teachers and teams an opportunity to collaborate and discuss their needs and concerns.  This time also gives the ENL teacher time to get feedback and give support to those teachers of ELLs that do not normally plan  with the ENL teacher. All teachers are provided with a list of PD opportunities as offered by various providers, i.e. NYCDOE,  SIBFSC and the UFT. Teachers are encouraged to select those PD opportunities that are consistent with their educational goals,  interest, student populations and are Common Core-aligned. Additionally, staff members are attending on-going (monthly) PD  sessions connected to MSQI which is cross-curricula in nature and Common Core aligned. Throughout I.S. 2's Professional  Development Plan there are a variety of topics that include the differentiating of ELLs according to their Language Proficiency  Levels and for former ELLs to support their transition into a non ENL/ELA Program. The ENL Teacher will also be providing  professional development regarding scaffolding of strategies to incorporate academic language in the classroom.All teachers  of ELLs will also be given a NYSESLAT PD that will expose the content area teachers to the expectations of an ELL on the  NYSESLAT. They will then be able to see how the NYSESLAT is based on all content areas. The content area teachers will be  given strategies and tools to use that will help them incorporate language into their classroom, and focus on all four modalities  (listening, speaking, reading and writing).       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  I.S. 2 will meet the 50% PD mandate by attending the ENL PDs given by the Staten Island Field Support Office.  The mandate  will also be met each month during Monday PD times when teachers share best practices and strategies geared to both Special  Education and ELL students.  I.S. 2 will meet the 15% mandate during Monday PD sessions.  ENL teaches will turnkey PDs from  the Staten Island Field Support Office.  Guidance staff and the Parent Coordinator meet with ELLs and their families to review the high school application process and  assist the families in making informed choices. Invitations to these sessions are coordinated through the use of the School  Messenger System that provides notification in the student's home language. Guidance Counselors work closely with the ENL  teacher to better assist ELLs as they transition to high school.  I.S. 2 professional development takes the form of workshops  geared to address Differentiated Instruction in the ELL classroom and meeting the needs of the ELL student in the content  areas. This PD is monitored by the LAP Team and teachers are selected to attend on a rotating basis. All staff interacting with  ELL students will be provided PD throughout the year during Monday PD sessions to comply with the 15% for general  education teachers and 50% for our ENL teacher. Attendance records for these sessions are maintained by the Principal and  Payroll Secretary.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During the Tuesday Afternoons Parent Outreach, our ENL teacher schedules meetings to speak with parents, in person or by  phone, to discuss language development progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs  in all content areas. During our Curriculum Conference the ENL teachers discusses the goals with the parents.  If there is a need  for translations services, the school can provide assistance in Spanish, Hebrew, Polish, Russian and Italian; for all other  languages, services are provided via the telephone. The ENL teacher will share the English proficiency levels and the Targets of  Measurement with the parents.  Assessment data from baselines, end of unit tests, and current reading levels will also be  shared and explained to the parents.  Based on the English proficiency level of the student, next steps and goals will be shared  from New York State ESL standards.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  All parents of ELLs are contacted by the Parent Coordinator and Parent Teacher Association to attend all school functions and  activities, i.e. PTA meetings, school trips, Winter Concert, Spring Concert, Science Fair, International Fair, Family Science Night,  Family Game Night, etc.. Using the automated messaging system, School Messenger, notices are sent in the language indicated  on the HLIS. Also events are announced on the Pupil Path. Notices are also sent home in their native languages. Our ENL  teacher meets with each individual ELL parent (in addition to Parent Teacher Conferences and Tuesday Parent Engagement) to  discuss their child's progress and next steps to assist in their learning and encourage further progress to English Proficiency.  At  I.S. 2 we have an after school program funded by Title III. An after school drama program targeting ELLs approximately begins  around January and runs through May. The families of the participating students will be invited to join with their children in  creating the production.  All parents will be invited to attend the culminating event during the Spring Arts Schowcase.  Overview of the NYS testing and NYSESLAT, the importance of home work and independent reading.  The ENL teacher works  with the guidance counselor in regards to disseminating High School information to 8th grade students.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Adrienne Stallone, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   I.S. 2 George L Egbert                                                                              School DBN: 31R002  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs a comprehensive review of Home  Language Identification Surveys, ATS (RAPL) and SESIS is used to determine the type and frequency of native  language needs. This information is used to determine the types of translation support needed by our parent  community. These data bases are monitored on a monthly basis to ensure timely compliance with translation  needs of the school community.
