This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.

In addition, this special student population should be provided with trans-language implementations. This is  our school wide initiative that will allow students from all cultures to utilize both languages and diverse resources to  gain successful outcomes. Another specific need that will assist in enhancing growth is ensuring that the school  administers a School Wide Ecology Assessment. This will help educators assess the school to ensure that all student  cultures are represented as it relates to parent contact, classroom instruction, school wide displays, school events,  and student assessments.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Supportive Environment and Collaborative Teachers are two elements in the Framework for Great Schools that are  school made progress this year. Our school has been a Showcase School for three years now under the umbrella of  Teacher Development. This is because of our teachers that collaborate during the inquiry process and our unique  cultural environment that is very supportive. Our school has shown more growth on the School Survey last year in all  areas. This is evidence that our collaboration and trust are growing as we progress as a school. Our school also has  made tremendous gains in the NYS ELA and Math especially in our level 4s. The key area of focus that is apparent in  both NYS ELA and NYS Math is our students' writing. It is our belief that having an increased focus on writing across all  content areas will help us strive to success.   The Element of Framework for Greater Schools that we made one of the most progress is Rigorous Instruction. The  end result is our NYS ELA and NYS Math test scores increased by 10% in certain areas. Our school made the most  progress this year in Grade 3. It is mainly from our Writing Pathways Program that was implemented for all 3rd grade  classes as well as our highly effective 3rd grade teachers. We went up by 10% in Level 4s in NYS ELA as well as go up  by 12% in Level 4s in our NYS Math data. Our key element of focus this year is schoolwide writing.   Instructional Focus     The Eastwood Team will engage in a whole school effort to display growth in literacy and mathematics.   Students will engage in a deeper exploration of real world math problem solving and conceptual  understanding. This engagement will be exemplified by the use of specific best practices that will support  mathematical discussions, reasoning, appropriate use of math tools, fluency and math journal writing.

By June 2019, we will increase our ELA and Math performance by 5% as measured by the NYS ELA and NYS Mathematics  Assessment through support from Administrative Team, Coaches, Teachers as well as Parents.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Increase the rigor of ELA and Math instruction for high  performing students by integrating the Common Core standards  during curriculum planning. We will increase the rigor by  incorporating differentiated learning strategies that will focus on  the specific needs of students. Higher order thinking techniques  along with student centered strategies will be implemented  during instruction. The Advance System has frequent data of  observations and specific feedback which is turnkey to the  teachers within a timely manner.    Teachers modify guided reading and Math exemplars by using  more complex mentor texts and learning supports which  encourage student autonomy. Teachers will use data trends to  set goals for targeted (Level 1s and 2s) student groups as well as  our ENL and SWD population. We will have students use context  clues for determining the meaning of words and phrases as they  are used in text (4RL4) for all students by utilizing the DOK  (Depth of Knowledge).   Parents will be invited to meetings, workshops and classes.  Parents will be able to meet and contact teachers every Tuesday  Parent Contact Day to discuss their child’s progress. Parents can  also access their child’s report card and data from NYC School  Accounts.   Implement specific professional development activities such as  "Teacher Rounds" where teachers can visit each other to observe  best practices. Every grade meets in their teacher teams at least  once a week for inquiry team and they use the writing tuning  protocol to improve on student writing utilizing classroom  techniques and teacher shared ideas. Teachers work with Data  Specialist to increase teacher capacity to track trends for  individual and groups of students at the classroom and team  level in order to deepen staff awareness and understanding of  data trends.          3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Prior to hiring a candidate, their credentials are verified to ensure that the candidate holds a valid NYS certification in  that license area. The BEDS survey is reviewed by the Principal and the DOE HR Director who work with our school to  ensure that every teacher’s assignment aligns with their license area so that all teachers are reported as Highly  Qualified on the BEDS Survey.   Strategies and activities used to recruit, retain and support highly qualified teachers are indicated below:   ● Frequent communication with our Human Resources (HR) Director when vacancies occur    ● Central Office of Talent and Recruitment partners with colleges and the HR Director partners with Central for  assistance and guidance and for candidate referrals   ● Participating in Central Hiring Fair events where pre-screened Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) candidates are  interviewed and recruited.   ● Establishing a partnership with a local college to support the grooming of student teachers in our search of HQT  candidates.    ● Interviewing HQT candidates from the Open Market Hiring System and the Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) Pool.   ● Establishing a rigorous interview protocol that includes intensive criteria for the selection of new staff members  including demonstration lessons, interviews and New York State certification/licensing.   ● Maintaining a teacher resource center and professional library to promote and effective practices.    ● Teachers will be provided with curriculum maps, instructional resources, and professional learning opportunities to  ensure that teachers improve teaching practice as per ADVANCE and Danielson and are highly qualified.    ● New teachers are provided with a mentor.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      ● Teachers are encouraged to participate in Lunch and Learns, after school Professional Learning Cycles(PLC) and to  attend off-site workshops when appropriate.    ● Individualized PD plans are created for teachers to ensure continued improvement.   ● Carefully made teacher assignments are designed to match teacher talent with school needs.   In the very rare event, if a teacher’s status was deemed not HQT, the Principal would consult with the network Human  Resources Director for guidance to ensure that the non-HQT teacher will meet all required documentation and  teacher assessment deadlines. This may include some form of counseling including encouraging the teacher to  become HQT through the High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation (HOUSSE) system.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our school developed a comprehensive professional development plan that addresses CCLS, Danielson, our  instructional focus and school-wide goals. Professional development opportunities are also differentiated based on  the needs of groups of teachers and individual teachers. Our PLC process is based on findings from research of both  effective learning and instruction tied to increased student achievement. The PLC encourages teacher collaboration,  focuses on learning tied to CCLS standards, uses a systematic improvement strategy and monitors progress of  teachers and students.   ● Teachers will participate in professional learning opportunities conducted by Content Coaches and Assistant  Principals in the content areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies and how Danielson can support teaching  practices in content areas.   ● The Principal, APs, Coaches and Instructional Lead Teachers will attend workshops provided. They will turnkey the  information and deliver workshops or Lunch and Learns to teachers and paraprofessionals in the use of DOK, Essential  Questions, ongoing assessment practices to increase best practices and academic rigor in literacy, math, science and  social studies aligned with CCLS.   ● Implementation of the Core Curriculum “Go Math” for Math will be supported through high quality professional  development for teachers and paraprofessionals delivered by the Principal, APs, or the outside educational  consultant.    ● Teacher teams will be trained in how to use data effectively to develop flexible grouping, track student performance  trends and elevate programs and strategies in order to monitor and revise their practices.   ● Provide teachers with intensive staff development in all curriculum areas.   ● Utilize key teachers/facilitators, coaches and staff developers to turnkey training.   ● Utilize seminars and workshops by literacy and mathematics organizations.   ● Facilitate collaboration among teachers for the purpose of planning instruction and sharing best practices.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A                 Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  As a neighborhood school we will enroll students from zoned neighborhoods. We will form a K Transition Team  including the Principal, AP for Early Childhood, School Counselor, IEP Teacher, the Parent Coordinator and parents (if  applicable) who will work collaboratively to assist preschool children as they transition from early childhood programs  to the elementary school program. The team will meet to track student data trends and evaluate overall readiness.  Eligible students will be provided with early intervention services to address academic and social/emotional needs.  During the year, Kindergarten teacher teams will evaluate curriculum for vertical and horizontal alignment through  the lens of the Common Core Learning Standards to ensure a seamless transition from PreK –to- Kindergarten. To  ensure seamless transitions, the expectation is that our Kindergarten teachers will engage in Lunch and Learns  regarding CCLS for Early Childhood grades. Our school embraces a Parents-As-Parents model through professional  development opportunities and parent engagement activities that increase parent involvement, build parent  effectiveness, deepen their understanding of CCLS while elevating high expectations for student learning.   The K Transition Team will act as the steering committee for this initiative by meeting regularly throughout the school  year to monitor the process and suggest revisions to actions and strategies in order to ensure a smooth transition  from the early childhood Pre K program to the Kindergarten elementary school program.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The assessment team attended professional development sessions to learn about the ADVANCE teacher evaluation  system. The assessment team meets one to two times a month to review all options. The principal’s decision, on the  selection of assessments, was informed by recommendations made by the assessment team. During Mondays  Professional Learning Days the school provides professional learning regarding the use of all assessments and  ADVANCE to improve instruction. This is one topic out of many that are conducted during Monday’s Professional  Learning Day. Our school uses several appropriate assessment measures such as common core pre and post unit  assessments, classroom assessments and on-line assessments. Teacher Teams meet weekly to look at student work  and track student performance trends to establish flexible grouping and to provide scaffolds and extensions to  accelerate student learning. The school also uses multiple assessment measures to inform professional development   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      opportunities that are scheduled throughout the year and are aligned with Danielson, the new Core Curriculum in ELA  and Math to build teacher capacity in the use of data assessment results to improve instructional practice.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  X         X     X         Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   744,598.00     247,734.00     50,872.00     19,533.00     7,817,239.00   X     X     X         X           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 95 Q ~ The Eastwood School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [PS 95 Q ~ The Eastwood School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The groups are small; consisting of no more than 15 students.  Immigrant  students from the Caribbean countries where English is spoken as a dialect will be merged with  our ENL students as they have similar language needs.  Students will be using materials from  Continental Press that includes a picture dictionary and an English language book with activities  covering the modalities of reading, writing, speaking and listening.

On a monthly basis, teachers will analyze data looking at trends and specific areas  for student growth and progress.  The title III team will use the Tuning Protocol as a tool when  looking at student work.  The Tuning Protocol gives the educator the opportunity to share student  work with colleagues. The educator will receive respectful feedback in terms of warm and cool  perspectives.  The feedback will give educators insightful strategies to improve  instruction.  Professional Development will also include teachers sharing their successful lessons  and strategies. Strategies would include instructional moves learned at the ELL Instructional  Leadership Institute (EILI).  These strategies include “What Makes you say that”, word sorts,  Think-Write-Pair-Share, See/Say, Mean Matter and others.   Through the use of inter-visitations,  teachers will be able to share and discuss best practices modeled in the classroom.   Professional  Development will also include teachers sharing ways of incorporating technology into their  lessons.  Teachers of the Title III program will be able to work with a staff developer, data  specialist, as well as the ESL/ Bilingual Coordinator.  Assistant Principals also meet regularly  with the teaching staff to ensure that the needs of the English Language Learners are met.        In addition to the monthly professional development, title III teachers also meet and plan  during regularly scheduled common preparation periods, lunch and learns, grade wide inquiry  teams and grade conferences.

Every Classroom Teacher as well as push-in/pull-out ENL teachers help with running records for the Fountas and Pinnell. P.S.  95 Q has one teacher from every grade, as well as ENL teachers, meeting every Monday during Professional Learning  Community (PLC) time to conduct the Inquiry Process and Curriculum Planning. During this time, the staff analyzes data and  constructs a plan for guidance in instructional planning. In addition, the P.S. 95Q Data Inquiry Team and grade level inquiry  teams meet weekly to further assist instructional planning.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Datacation, NYC Performance Task, Fountas and Pinnell     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in place to help with small group instruction. This helps the students with one to  one academic skill processing.  There are also after school programs, including Title III programs, to address interventions.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ENLs enrolled in RTI are tested four times a year with Gates-MacGinitie which is uploaded in Datacation. The data and item  analysis is used to reflect progress. All support services given to the ENLs is aligned to an intervention plan based on their item  analysis data. In addition, the RTI teacher has NYSESLAT data, information about the student's native language, number of  years the student has spent in the ESL program and SIFE information.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     In examining students’ results in the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing, it is evident that in  kindergarten and first grade, the results demonstrate a high percentage of beginner and intermediate level students. This  indicates that Basic English language skills must be emphasized through daily exercises in speaking, listening, reading and  writing. The statistical results also indicate that students are beginning to achieve high results of success in second grade.  Therefore, intensive ENL instruction should be targeted in grades kindergarten, one, and two in an effort to ensure that the  students “test out” after the NYSESLAT is administered in grade two.  Third, fourth, and fifth grade students will be targeted  for intensive instruction in the four modalities using ESL strategies and methodologies that will be integrated in the content  area instruction in order to increase their language acquisition proficiency.  In addition, teachers use the data in order to  provide differentiated instruction.  The teacher can tailor lessons to the need of the student; some ENLs need more help in  reading and writing while others might need more instruction in listening and speaking.                         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The AMAO tool is used to see how our ENL students are performing.  It shows us that the majority of our ENL students are  making progress on the Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives.  It shows us which ELL students need Academic  Intervention because they are scoring low on the ELA or Math test.  It shows us which students are considered long term ENLs  and are therefore in need of some extra help.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Organizational models include push-in, and self contained ELL classes.  Our classes are heterogeneous; classes consist  of students with mixed proficiency levels.  Our students receive the mandated minutes that they are entitled to as per  their scores on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Students that receive a NYSESLAT score of EN and EM receive the  mandated 180 minutes of Stand Alone ESL by a licensed ESL teacher.  In addition, these students also receive the  mandated integrated ENL instruction of 180 minutes a week by a licensed ESL teacher. The ENL teacher and  Classroom teacher work together to provide content instruction using language goals and content goals.  The  Students performing at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive the mandated 180 minutes a week of  integrated ESL.  The ESL teacher, with the classroom teacher, provide both content and language instruction.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We have one Transitional bilingual class (TBE) in grades two and three.  It is a self contained bilingual class.  The  Bilingual teacher provides home language instruction (Spanish) as well as ENL instruction. The certified bilingual  teacher will provide integrated as well as stand alone ENL instruction as per CR Part 154.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Our school has a 50/50 Dual Language program in grades Kindergarten and one Stand Alone and Integrated ENL  instruction are provided by a licensed ESL teacher serving those classes.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               In the bilingual classrooom, our licensed bilingual teachers are responsible for teaching the ESL, ELA and NLA as per CR  Part 154.  Each bilingual teacher puts in their program card the number of minutes given to HLA, ELA and ENL.  In our  monolingual classrooms, ESL teachers deliver ESL according to the proficiency levels of their students.  The teachers indicate  the number of minutes given to ESL and ELA instruction.  Both program cards are reviewed by the ESL/Bilingual Coordinator  and the Assistant Principal.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In our self contained classroom, ENL students are grouped together in the class for the entire school day and for all content  instruction.  The teacher is a certified ENL teacher.  The teacher will use ESL methodologies including Total Physical Response,  using graphic organizers and and using diagrams.  In our push-in model, an ENL certified teacher works with ENLs in  collaboration with the general education teacher to help with language acquisition.  These teachers will plan together. The  teachers will use ESL methodologies such as using diagrams, and graphic organizers.  The bilingual class is a self contained  classroom.  The language is Spanish and all native language arts and ENL content is taught by a certified bilingual teacher.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Native language is evaluated by Lab R Spanish exams, teacher quizzes and tests, and the ELE exam.  The ELE exam is a  Spanish Reading Assessment exam.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are provided with several intervention services, including Academic  Intervention services and Title III after school programs.  These services which are offered to all of our ENLs help to ensure that  our students attain English proficiency and meet the same achievement standards that all children are expected to meet.  ESL  and bilingual teachers are trained to use many visuals and hands on instruction and to employ ESL methods and strategies  with their students. ENLs that have been identified as having special needs receive ESL instruction along with other indicated  services, such as Special Education Teacher Support Services (S.E.T.S.S), counseling and speech.          New arrivals to our school are paired with a buddy student who speaks their native language.  Special attention is given to  this student from the classroom teacher who welcomes and assists our new arrival through his/her adjustment period.  All  classroom teachers are encouraged to use alternative techniques to communicate with the student i.e. drawings, hand  movements and gesturing.  Translators are available to communicate with the student and the student’s parents.          The administration, ESL staff, guidance counselor, and parent coordinator are available to support the incoming ENL  population academically, socially and emotionally. Multiculturalism is addressed through classroom lessons and guidance  interventions in order to develop an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance. The children are encouraged to find  commonalities in the various ethnic groups in our school. This will better prepare them for the multicultural world that awaits  them.          For our ENLs receiving services for 4-6 years, differentiated instruction is provided in order to meet their individual learning  styles.   We also encourage our ENLs to attend our  Title III Literacy / Mathematics and Program which embody the various  modalities of language acquisiton such as reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Our potential long term ENLs 4-6 years also  receive ESL services by a licensed English as a Second Language Teacher.  Progress of potential long term ENLs are monitored  on an ongoing basis by utilizing scores from exams such as the ELL Periodic, NYSESLAT, NYS Assessment, Predictives, Portfolios,  as well as teacher made tests.  Classroom teachers consistently plan with ESL Providers in order to maximize and target  instruction.  Field trips are encouraged in order for our ELLS to gain real life experiences and bring the curriculum to life.     Our former ENLs (1 and 2 years after testing proficient) are eligible for ELL testing accomodations and 90 minutes of English as  a new language.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWD's  use the Pearson Reading Street series for Reading and the Go Math series for mathematics. The  materials have special activities built in for ENL SWD students.  These students are served by licensed ESL teachers that use ESL  methodologies, such as Total Physical Response, and employ pictures and diagrams to accelerate English language  development.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school places ELL-SWD students in the least restrictive environment ranging from general education classrooms to ICT and  to 12-1-1 classes.  ALL of our ELL-SWD students are fully served by the ESL teacher in either a self contained or push in  model.  In addition, AIS instructors do push-in with our ELLs/SWDs to help achieve their IEP goals.  Aside from flexible  scheduling with AIS we offer a Title III After School for these students.  All of our classes use the Pearson Reading Street and Go  Math Curriculum.  In addition, ESL teachers provide Professional Development to staff, including SWD teachers that will assist  in instructional planning.  ENL providers assist and give feedback for students with IEPs on SESIS and for the students'  Individualized Education Plan. ENL providers will push in to work with SWD students throughout the day including Literacy and  Math block as well as Science/Social Studies.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52       Targeted intervention programs for ENL students in ELA, math and other content areas include an afterschool program,  and  Academic Intervention services (AIS) . We offer classes during the February and Spring Recess.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are expanding the use of technology such as Imagine Learning to more ELL students.  We will also increase the use of  technology to students.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ENL students are considered for each school program that is offered.  Some ENL students will be placed in a Literacy/Math  Afterschool program.  This program will be designed to practice skills needed on the ELA and state math test.  Some ENL  students will participate in the Title III program.  The Title III program will be offered to ESL / bilingual students in grades 3, 4  and 5.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.    Selected ENL students in all grades will use Imagine Learning. Imagine Learning is a technology based program designed to  raise overall proficiency levels. We are using MyOn for ELA and Think Central for math that will help the ENL students in the  Title III program.  Other materials include ELL components in the Pearson Reading Street Program and Go Math series.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Our school offers a Transitional Bilingual Program and Dual Language.  The Bilingual program features Spanish being taught at  least two periods per day.  Spanish is taught using the Spanish component of Go Math.  In addition, the school uses Palabras A  Su Paso to teach Spanish Literacy in Grades 2 and 3 Bilingual class. The Estrelita literacy program will be used for the grade K  Dual Language Program. The ENL classrooms have classroom libraries featuring books from various cultures.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our school has ENL self contained classes and also ENL Push In models.  Our self contained and Push- in classes contain  students that are all the same grade and age.         15.

In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Our school has a 50/50 side by side Dual Language Program in grades Kindergarten and one.  Each class  has a mix of ENL and English proficient students. Students are taught one day in English in one classroom  and the next day will be taught by the Spanish Language teacher in another classroom.  Therefore,  content is taught in both English and Spanish.  Each language will be taught on its own day.  Students are  taught both languages at the same time.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   ELL personnel at school have regularly scheduled monthly meetings .  The ESL team meeting , headed by the assistant  principal and ESL/Bilingual Coordinator, plan professional development with topics including how to read ELL data, and  applying the new curriculum to ENL students. At our monthly ESL and bilingual team meetings, our literacy and math coaches  present training on the materials and how they can be used with ENL students to meet the standards. During the school year,  ESL teachers present workshops during Professional Development Days, at Staff Faculty Conferences,  and grade conferences  to provide classroom teachers with the required ELL training. Professional Development is provided to teachers of ELLs  through Pearson Reading Street and the GO MATH series. These series are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  Topics include employing Common Core Learning Standards during lesson planning and curriculum mapping. Additionally, the  ESL Coordinator attends training provided by the NYC Division of English Language Learners.  The ESL coordinator will then  turnkey the training to classroom and ENL providers at regularly scheduled Monday Staff Development sessions.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Support is provided to staff in order to assist ENLs as they transition from elementary to middle school and/or middle to high  school. Teachers are trained to increase the rigor in ELA and Mathematics for our ENLs by utilizing the DOK (Depth of  Knowledge). We are training teachers to implement Imagine Learning , Think Central and My ON, which will improve overall  English language ability.         The ENL training for teachers include experienced coaches, coordinators and ENL teachers providing Professional  Development at regularly scheduled meetings.  Monolingual teachers and ENL teachers will discuss effective ESL  methodologies, strategies and tasks that will increase the rigor for the ENL students in the classroom.   In addition, ENL and  monolingual classsroom teachers are sent to outside Professional Development meetings having to do with ENL students  including the NYSABE conference.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54              Teachers will schedule meetings for the parents of ENL students .

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kim Hill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Eastwood School                                                                              School DBN: 29Q095  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

This interview is conducted by the ESL/Bilingual Coordinator or members of the ESL department. Parents  are asked the language that they would like the school to contact them in written and oral communications. In  addition, parents complete the Blue Emergency Card, where the parent provides the language that they wish the  school to use as a means of communication. This information is transferred to Automate the School (ATS)  computer system.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication.
