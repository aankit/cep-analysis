This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We will strive to provide a safe environment where all members of the community will be held accountable for the  success of each member through efficient structures and clear expectations. We will provide learning experiences  which develop the learner’s passion for the awareness of his or her own learning. We will utilize this passion for  learning and educate the whole person by providing a wide variety of academic challenges and expose the student to  diverse, non-academic activities. We will improve staff practice and student performance by consistent reflection,  feedback and evaluation. We will create a culture that recognizes and celebrates achievement. We will create an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      accessible learning environment where effort is recognized and celebrated, and members are encouraged to do their  best.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The school population comprises 23 % Black, 76% Hispanic and 0.7% White students. Boys account for 49% of the  students enrolled and girls account for 51%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016- 2017 was 93.4%      The school community is located in Morris Heights, a diverse, vibrant neighborhood in the southwestern Bronx.  Morris Heights has a population of around 36,779. Almost half the population lives below the poverty line and  receives public assistance (TANF, Home Relief, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid). The vast majority of  residents in the area are of Puerto Rican, Dominican, or African American descent, with a growing community of  immigrants from several other countries in South and Central America, Africa, and the Caribbean.      Our school has been at the forefront of the implementation of the Hochman Basic Writing Skills (BWS) program in  NYC and this has been integrated into ELA, Social Studies and Science curricula.       We continue our partnership with a Creative School Services consultant, which has enabled us to develop curriculum  and assessment tools along with implementing the Hochman program. This year, with a view to deepening the  investigative nature of our science curriculum we will be committing even more to the Project Based Inquiry Science  (PBIS) curriculum. Also, this year we have become Learning Partners with The Highbridge Green School as well as PS  204, schools with strong curricular, pedagogical, and community connections to CIS303. We we will be sharing some  curriculum, conducting inter-school visits and engaging in shared PD when appropriate.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 15% English language learners and 31% special education students. In addition, 99% qualify  for free lunch.      Students in Poverty: Research into the impact of poverty on the lives of children is very clear. There is a significant  likelihood that many students suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of exposure to community  violence and / or domestic violence. This has a negative impact on student learning, and while we can not make major  changes to these two situations, we can do one significant thing in schools to improve student's chances of using  education to move out of this cycle of poverty. That single thing is to provide a safe, supportive school environment in  which             all students have at least one adult they can communicate closely with  teachers remain emotionally constant throughout the day  students have voice  the halls and classrooms are safe spaces where students are willing to participate and take risks learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      the school feels like family to all members of the school community         ELLS: Continued consistent language based objectives throughout all subject learning. Provision of targeted support  for students at varying level of proficiency. These students also require clear and sequenced English language writing  instruction that is the cornerstone of the Hochman Basic Writing Skills program. Likewise they need supportive  opportunities for oral language practice in the form of structured discussion protocols. Strong vocabulary instruction  is also a strong need of our ELL students. In order for these skills to be learned, ELL students requires a safe and  supportive environment where risk taking is encouraged and mistakes are seen as part of the learning process.      Student with IEPs: Of our 32.84% of students with disabilities, 50% are in an ICT setting. 45% are in a 12:1:1 setting,  while the remainder receive related services. Likewise students with IEPs need a safe and supportive environment  where risk taking is encouraged and mistakes are seen as part of the learning process. Our IEP students have a broad  range of needs. Students need to be engaged in their learning and have multiple opportunities to process information  in numerous ways. Project based learning supports students with these experiences.                  4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction    Progress Made Last Year   ELA and math again stood out in terms of building better practice on a solid foundation. Through the trial of science  and social studies curriculum, we learned, thorough observations and teacher and student reflection, that these  choices are not currently viable for our school. This led to further investigation of possible curricula and the  implementation of these two new curricula will form the focus for next year.       Focus for Next Year:    Deeper implementation of Project Based inquiry Science Curriculum (PBIS)   Implementation of new 8th grade Social Studies curriculum based on The Highbridge Green School curriculum.      5 B Supportive Student Environment    Progress Made Last Year   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Significant progress was made this year. Our goal was to set up a robust advisory program. This was successful, and  every class implemented a 5 day advisory program. Although the framework rating for this area are not completed,  our school outscored the district and city in every sub-heading under this heading in the school survey results.    Focus for next year:    Build on last year's work to deepen the quality of specific advisory days.       5C Collaborative Teachers   Progress Made Last Year   Literacy Inquiry was successful last year with all literacy teachers participating in inquiry meetings and using  common reading and writing protocols across the entire school. Teachers in science and social studies including  reading , writing , listening and speaking protocol in all lessons and the weekly meetings provided opportunities for  teachers to share and contribute to performance task design and view work produced by students across the  subject areas.    Teachers in Special Education self contained classes revised their units to improve entry points and CFUs. Last  year's 8th grade inquiry focused on writing analysis and generated a topic for a special inquiry project this year:  How can we use multi-media experiences to strengthen and sophisticate student writing?    Focus for next year:    Increase reading PD for new teachers at start of year and target the SSR reading time for observations and coaching.   One of our master teachers will be taking on the role of MSQI coordinator so that we can improve our SSR time to  deepen literacy engagement at our school.      5D Effective School Leadership   Progress Made Last Year   The focus of Teach Like a Champion (TLAC) inquiry was to build student discussion skills and the meta-cognition of  discussion.    This was a strong area of growth for us last year . We saw all classes studying key discussion techniques from the Ratio  (student discourse) section of the TLAC book, and trialling these in classrooms. Teachers videoed themselves and their  classes and analyzed this footage to reflect on both teacher and student moves. In some classes, teachers showed this  footage to students and included them in the discussion about ways to improve discussion in the class. Teachers  presented their findings at the end of year retreat and the presentations showed significant growth in teacher  understanding and skill. The videos and other student work viewed during this inquiry, demonstrated strong speaking  skills and student voice. An unintended outcome was the realization that involving students as co-learners in the  inquiry (i.e. showing video of class and asking students to reflect on the process design next steps ) was seemingly  very effective. Furthermore, we discovered that having students take the role of teachers or co-teachers (based on  the work of Dr. Christopher Emdin - Columbia University) had strong benefits.

One of our master teachers in 6th will further investigating how using Dr. Emdin's work using this video meta- cognitive process can strengthen student learning.      5 E Strong Family and Community Ties   Progress Made Last Year   2017-2018 saw real progress. We met the goal of five parent events aimed at increasing parent awareness of  instruction and providing tools for assisting their child's learning. The events were well attended and successful. We  had our first ever Community BBQ as well as a Family Math Night, among other successful events.   Initial meetings have also taken place with Kipps Bay Boys and Girls Clubs to build a relationship aimed at increasing  opportunities for our students to access to safe and supportive outside of school in our local community.    Focus for next year:    Maintain and build parental involvement thorough the continuation of school events.   Target the issue raised in question 4 of the School Quality Survey    Build relationships with local community CBOs.      Trust    Our Framework rating of trust was 3.56. In every single question answers by students ,teachers and parents, our  school outscored both the District and City scores. Even our lowest data point, where 76% of students agreed that  'their teachers always do what they say they are going to do' was 10% higher than the city and 9% higher than the  District.            instructional Focus 2018-2019    Teachers will build rigorous thinking through the use of common reading protocols (close reading, reciprocal  teaching), the development of rigorous questioning and discussion practices and the alignment of written  performance tasks across ELA, Social Studies and Science.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X303   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   332   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Indicate the data trends, source and year.        5 A Rigorous Instruction    Strengths    ELA    The school has a long history of curriculum development, and has proven aligned curriculum units that are revised on  an ongoing basis. We have common tracked scores in Academic Vocabulary, Reading and Writing units of study that  align both across the school. Ongoing formative and summative assessments are an integral part of unit and lesson  plans. Students track their goals and engage in reflections at the completion of every unit of study . Our 8th grade  ELA test data displays the cumulative impact of the three years of cohesive literacy instruction is paying off (at least in  writing) as we outscored the city in 7 of the 9 of the constructed responses. 75% of our students based on the 2017- 18 ELA state test data scored a 2-4, and 31% of our students scored a 3 or 4.    Math:   In math the school has continually striven to implement the CMP 3 curriculum with a focus on student discourse and  problem solving. With a high turnover of math teachers this year, maintaining the ongoing professional development  required for successful implementation of CMP 3 will be a challenge. The work is led by Bushra Makiya (three-time  Math for America Master Teacher and 2016 New York Big Apple Award 2016 winner). The department has already  created vertical and horizontal alignment of the curriculum, while promoting and sharing good practice as a host site  for Math in the City workshops which bring teachers from multiple schools to share practice. Several math units also  need revision this year. Our Integrated Algebra program was highly successful. Out of the thirty students tested, 7%  scored 4s and 93% scored level 3. On the Math state test, 57% of our students based on the 2016-17 ELA state test  data scored a 2-4, and 19% of our students scored a 3 or 4.       In math, we also use Stein and Smith’s task analysis framework to select and analyze rich tasks and then using the 5  Practices to plan a rich summary discussion. As a result, all of our math teachers worked with the 5 Practices and they  are embedded into several of our math units.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      **In addition to these five, our City Year corps members are piloting a new math intervention based on the “flipped”  model. Students who need help with skills will watch videos on their specific needs, meet 1:1 with a tutor, and then  take a written test proving they have mastered the skill.**       Social Studies:    8th grade social studies piloted a unit using the Brown University Curriculum. This was challenging and illuminating.  The units required vast amounts of background knowledge to be understood. Students had heavy reading loads and  teachers needed to provide opportunities for students to talk and process while remaining engaged. To build  engagement in this work, we involved students in planning and presenting series of lessons in all 8th grade  classrooms. Student and teacher feedback about led us to conclude that we should select a curriculum that is more  immediately accessible to students, one which is CCLS aligned, makes connections between historical experiences  and current events and involves students in active participation as citizens with the local community. Our sister  school,The Highbridge Green School has been working with our Creative Schools Services Consultant whom we have  in common, to develop an 8th grade social studies curriculum that addresses the abovementioned needs . This year  we will be adapting and implementing this curriculum. We will also build our skills in using students in the teaching of  their peers is a powerful engagement and pedagogical tool that we should investigate further.    Science:   Last year we trialed the Project Based inquiry Science Curriculum (PBIS) curriculum, which offers ongoing labs at all  grade levels and incorporates the critical thinking that we want to develop in our students. The trial was very  successful, with 85% of our students scoring 75% or higher in the new curriculum. Next year we will be increasing our  role out of this curriculum.   The school's track record in curriculum development is also supported b the 2016-2017 NYC School Quality Guide  (Rigorous Instruction ) Framework Rating. This showed in an overall score of 4.02, .49 above the District average and  .34 above the City average.

Our goal was to set up a robust advisory program. This was successful, and  every class implemented a 5 day advisory program. Our school outscored the district and city in every sub-heading  under this heading in the school survey results.    Our data in this area is strong. According to the NYC School Quality Guide our school scored above the district and city  in every subheading from all three populations surveyed. 99% of respondents responded positively to the Supportive  Environment for Socio-Emotional indicators.    On the most recent Quality Review we were rated well developed in this area.    Focus for next year:    Build on last year's work to deepen the quality of specific advisory days.

We met our goal of making 1.2 years in growth across the school in writing  (as measured by our CCLS aligned writing continuum), our initial data from the City spreadsheet suggests that the  trend of 8th grade showing the cumulative impact of the three years of cohesive literacy instruction is paying off as  we outscored the city in 7 of the 9 of the constructed responses. Our reading data, as measured by the Fountas and  Pinnell Benchmark Reading Assessment showed an overall increase in reading scores 1.1 years in 6th grade (ELL 1.1  IEO 1.1) and 0.9 year in 7th (ELL 1.1 and IEP 1.0) 8th grade data is skewed as 8th grade students often test out of the  test before the end of the year, making progress impossible to track beyond this point with this assessment. 8th grade  inquiry focused on writing analysis and generated a topic for a special inquiry project this year. (One of our master  teachers will be investigating the multi-media question, "How can we use multi-media experiences to strengthen  and sophisticate student writing?" this year, with a view to piloting a process in 7th grade. )   Our 2015 QR acknowledged the strength of our collaborative culture with a rating of well developed.  The 2017-18  School Quality Guide reflects that we are well above the city and district average in every area under Collaborative  Teachers.   Needs for next year:   Maintain the literacy Inquiry process and continue the focus on looking at student work.    Increase reading PD for new teachers at start of year.   Target the Silent Sustained Reading (SSR) time and Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) reading intervantion for  observations and in coaching.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths   The focus of Teach Like a Champion (TLAC) inquiry was to build student discussion skills and student meta-cognition  about discussion.    This was a strong area of growth for us last year . We saw all classes studying key discussion techniques from the Ratio  (student discourse) section of the TLAC book, and trialing these in classrooms. Teachers videoed themselves and their  classes and analyzed this footage to reflect on both teacher and student moves. In some classes, teachers showed this  footage to students and included them in the discussion about ways to improve discussion in the class. Teachers  presented their findings at the end of year retreat and the presentations showed significant growth in teacher  understanding and skill. The videos and other student work viewed during this inquiry, demonstrated strong speaking  skills and student voice. An unintended outcome was the realization that involving students as co-learners in the  inquiry (i.e. showing video of class and asking students to reflect on the process design next steps ) was seemingly  very effective. Furthermore, we discovered that having students take the role of teachers or co-teachers (based on  the work of Dr. Christopher Emdin - Columbia University) had strong benefits. One of our master teachers in 6th will  further investigating how using Dr. Emdin's work using this video meta-cognitive process can strengthen student  learning.       In our most recent QR , The area of school improvement rated as well developed and was area of celebration.    In the 2016-2017 School Quality Report , our school ranked extremely high in this area.   Teacher Influence 20% above District Average 10% above City Average    Program coherence 21 % above District Average 17% above City Average    Instructional Leadership 15% above District Average 12% above City Average    Our ranking score was 4.75      Priority Needs Our challenges are a result of the high teacher turnover we have , so our plan to maintain a laser-like  focus on small number of high leverage areas is the best way to ensure fast acceleration of teacher effectiveness. The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28      use of locally produced (thereby relevant) video in teacher professional development is one way to speed up the  uptake for new teachers and strongly focus current teachers on their own practice.    Thus, our major need is to maintain our TLAC inquiry into high leverage techniques to build students thinking and  discussion , and use video to share and study teacher and student practice.

We met the goal of five parent events aimed at increasing parent awareness of  instruction and providing tools for assisting their child's learning. The events were well attended and successful.    Initial meetings have also taken place with Kipps Bay Boys and Girls Clubs to build a relationship aimed at increasing  opportunities for our students to access to safe and supportive outside of school in our local community.    Our framework rating for this area was 3.56. A close look at this data showed that in almost all areas of this survey our  school ranked higher than both the District and the City, however one data point was significant, because it was one  are where we were much lower than the District and the City. On question 4, only 47% of parents/guardians  responded that, since the beginning of the school year, they have been asked or had the opportunity to volunteer time  to support their school (for example, spent time helping in classrooms, helped with school-wide events, etc.)  sometimes or often.    This anomaly in our data provides a clear next step and focus for next year.    One small but significant step has also been made in improving our electronic connection with parents and families.  Our electronic grading program, TeacherEase, has, at our behest, developed an App to enable easy access to our on  line grading, This still need development for Android devices, but it represents a significant advance in home school  ties.    Focus for next year:    Maintain and build parental involvement thorough the continuation of school events.   Target the issue raised in question 4 of the survey mentioned above.

Assessment data is shared with all staff using electronic means.  Professional development includes regular viewing of this assessment data. The Principal's Cabinet, the Professional  Development Team, Grade Teams, and the TLAC Planning Team, all include teachers in professional development  planning and progress monitoring. Teachers in curriculum teams determine which assessments should be used at the  end of the school year for the following year and share that assessment data in weekly and monthly team meetings.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Teachers will work with students in a variety of whole class, small group and partner  activities.  Learning activities will be focused on developing academic vocabulary and literacy  skills through reading high-interest non-fiction texts.  Students will engage in reading, writing,  and speaking and listening through text-based discussions.   The program will use a research- based curriculum designed specifically for ELLs; Scholastic's English in 3-D.  The curriculum  and materials are supplemental to the ELA and ENL materials and curriculum used in daily  instruction during the school day. The curriculum will develop reading, writing, speaking and  listening skills.  The rationale for the program is that these targeted students need direct  instruction in academic language so that they can achieve proficiency before they exit 303 in  order to be successful in high school and beyond.  The student materials will be purchased using  Title III funds.   The program will target long-term ELLs in grades 6-8.  The program will take place after school  on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:10-4:30pm - there will be one session, two days a week.  The program will begin on November 9th and conclude April 27th  for a total of 42  sessions. Teachers will take attendance for each session and a record of attendance will be kept  on file in the main office.   The language of instruction will be English and instruction will be delivered by one certified  ENL teacher and one ELA teacher.  Home language support and development will be reinforced  through identification and use of cognates during academic vocabulary development. The ENL  teacher will provide support in Spanish if needed and students will have access to Google  translate in the classroom. The teachers will co-plan and co-teach the program to ensure that all  students receive language development from the ENL teacher.  The materials that will be used are the English in 3D workbook and the Issues text book, both  from Scholastic and designed to be used together to develop language skills for long-term  ELLs.  Notification of program participation to parents will be made in parents preferred  language by translation services.

The ENL teacher is a certified provider and will not be at any additional cost to the  program.  The PD that is provided by the in-house ENL teacher will positively benefit all ENL  students because the ENL teacher will be able to identify strategies that all teachers can  incorporate and practice across content to improve learning for their students.    The ENL and ELA teachers will participate in an on-going study of two texts to support ELLs  and improve ENL instruction: Reading, Writing and Learning in ENL, and Making Content  Comprehensible for English Learners: The SIOP Model.  Teachers will meet every other  Monday from 4:10-5:10 to discuss how they will use what they learned from the texts to improve  instruction for ELLs.  Additionally, on the first Monday of each month teachers will discuss how  to align their study with the instruction of the English in 3-D program and  incorporate these  strategies. Agendas and sign-in sheets for these meeting will be kept by the ENL teacher.

All of these sessions have translation services.  Events scheduled for the 2017- 2018 school year are Meet the Teacher Night, Curriculum Nights, Gang and Violence  Prevention, High School Information Sessions, Community BBQ, Math Fun Night, and  computer training for our online grade book.  All parents have access to our online grade book,  TeacherEase.  TeacherEase is a valuable tool that allows parents to see grades, progress reports,  and communicate with teachers.  TeacherEase is available in both English and Spanish.  In  TeacherEase, teachers write comments that parents can respond to and it maintains a record of  parent/teacher communication.  At 303, teachers meet regularly with parents to discuss their students' academics on an individual  level. This year, the focus for parent involvement to impact higher achievement for ELLs is  reading. Teachers meeting with parents of ELLs to discuss how they can support their child's  reading skills even if they do not speak or read in English.  Parents of ELLs are shown how to  have reading conferences at home in their native language. Teachers receive training from the  ENL teacher about informing parents which strategies they should be using.  Additionally,  teachers communicate with parents via individual goal sheets.  The goal sheets for our ELLs  have specific learning targets for ELLs, and again, we meet with parents about the goals and how   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    they can communicate with their child about the goals.  All teacher/parent meetings are  translated/interpreted by a member of the 303 community when required.  Parent Association meetings take place once a month and organized by the parent coordinator,  Jacqueline Gonzalez and the PA President. The meetings are translated into Spanish and all  written communication is provided in English and Spanish and additional translation services are  provided if requested so that parents of Title III students can participate fully with parents of  non-Title III students. Parents are notified with fliers, monthly school calendars, and telephone  outreach in their preferred language.  The parent coordinator collects a sign-in sheet and a copy  of the agenda and sign-in sheet are filed in the school office.  In addition to parent association meetings, there will be three workshops specifically for parents  of English Language Learners.  The meeting will take place in February, March and May.  In  February, there will be an information session for parents of ELLs about ENL classes for adults  and earning a GED.  In March the meeting will tell parents what they need to know about state  tests (ELA, Math, Science and the NYSESLAT) and how parents can help their students feel  prepared.  In May, the meeting for parents of ELLs will focus on the transition to high school  and how to support students through the transition, and how parents can stay informed of their  student's ELL status.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  CIS 303 uses the Fountas and Pinnell diagnostic to assess ELLs' literacy skills.  The diagnostic is given at the beginning, middle  and end of the year to assess progress.  The data from this assessment tool is used to plan instruction in reading and writing.  From this assessment, the ENL teacher is able to determine which ELLs require direct instruction in phonics, which ELLs require  instruction in reading comprehension, and which ELLs require both. The data shows that ELLs are performing below their  general education peers, and the data allows the ENL teacher to plan for instruction as well as support content teachers in  their planning to support the ELLs in their classrooms to develop language and literacy skills and make progress along the  proficiency continuum.   The reading data and research-based best practices for ELLs are shared with content area teachers so  that they can plan literacy instruction.  In addition to complex texts, content area teachers use this data to use appropriately  leveled texts and materials for their students.  Content area teachers also use baseline, midline and endline assessments to  plan instruction and assess learning.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Assessments are planned into the school’s calendar at the beginning of the year to ensure adequate time is give to the  assessments. Data is shared school-wide so all teachers have access to the information in order to plan instruction and  strategic instructional groupings.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  CIS 303 uses the same assessments three times each year in order to monitor progress and identify goals for students.  Therefore the summative assessments are used throughout the school year as formative assessments for progress monitoring  and to identify areas of need, and at the end of the year to celebrate success and plan next steps. Progress is monitored by  comparing the baseline assessment to the midline assessment and looking at areas of growth; and again with the endline.  Teachers identify where individual students have made progress and identify areas of growth.  This information is used to have  one-to-one conferences with students so that they may take part in goal setting in addition to teachers planning instruction for  individual learners and small group instruction. In this way instruction and goals are continuously aligned and measured.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students reflect on individual goals and confer with teachers and peers regularly regarding feedback and next steps related to  their individual goals. If a student is receiving targeted intervention (i.e. RTI outlined below) that specific intervention will be  monitored through ongoing assessment and feedback.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ELLs, in addition to the HLIS, are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell as a universal screener. This data allows the school to  make linguistically responsive decisions. As a school, Tier 1 instruction is planned using Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to  be responsive to all learners, and reading, writing and critical thinking is taught across all content areas. When data indicates  that students need an intervention, students will receive Tier 2 or 3 interventions as needed. To support ELLs whose literacy  skills are below grade level benchmarks, they receive small group instruction using Fountas and Pinnell’s Leveled Literacy  Intervention; a research-based program shown to support students acquiring English.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Evaluating the data from the 2017 NYSESLAT, 90% of ELLs are at the Expanding performance level overall according to the  performance level indicators. Therefore the primary focus will be on ensuring Tier 1 instruction is responsive to the linguistic  and cultural needs of all students to continue to move them to Expanding and Commanding with a focus on all four modalities  and research-based best practices for ELLs with instructional minutes delivered through Integrated ENL. In addition to  Integrated ENL, the 10% of students at Transitioning will receive targeted ENL minutes with the ENL teacher. Additionally we  will continue to assess all students and utilize small group instruction and interventions (listed above) as needed.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data is shared school-wide so that all teachers can use the information to inform content-area classes. Students that are not  showing as much growth and/or will benefit from additional interventions will be part of our cycles of student inquiry.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Based on data provided by tests of English language proficiency, the ENL program at CIS 303 groups students by their  level of English language proficiency within a grade level. These students are then serviced in classes by a certified ENL  teacher in pull-out groups. During integrated ENL minutes, students receive their minutes in a block schedule in mixed  proficiency levels.  Additionally, the ENL teacher works with all content area teachers to plan differentiated  instruction for ELLs in their content area classes. ENL instruction meets both State-wide content-area standards and  State-wide ENL standards for students’ development in reading, writing, listening, and speaking English. The ENL  program provides the mandated students with either 180 or 360 minutes per week of language learning, based upon  their proficiency level (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, Commanding).      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students are programmed for ENL and ELA minutes based on their proficiency levels from the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL: Students  that are Entering and Emerging receive 360 minutes per week, Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes per week, and  Commanding students receive 90 minutes per week.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All students at CIS 303 participate in a Common Core aligned curriculum that includes English language arts, mathematics,  social studies, and science, and ELLs take part in these classes along with their mainstream classmates. ELLs are working with  complex texts and critical thinking discussion questions in all content areas.  The ENL teacher works with the content area  teachers to plan instruction that ensures that students have an entry point to the content. All teachers at CIS 303 participate in  ongoing PD regarding ELLs, differentiation, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and best practices for ELLs in the classroom.  As  a result, all ELL subgroups receive differentiated instruction in all of their content area classes while developing English  language skills.  Teachers incorporate Academic Vocabulary into their lessons in order to build vocabulary for all ELLs.  Every  classroom is equipped with a leveled library, and students read independently each day through the use of trade books that  they select themselves in correspondence with their individual reading levels.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students are assessed on their home language during the ELL identification process.  State exams are offered in students'  Home Language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ELL Subgroups  SIFE: Students that are determined to be SIFEs are assessed using baselines in all of the content areas to determine if there are  areas of significant gaps.  Determination of need is made on an individual basis. Students may require one on one tutoring,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      small group instruction and additional time to learn material that they missed while they were not following the NYS  curriculum.  Newcomers: New LEP students are given instructional and peer support to aid in their integration into the mainstream  classroom community. Newcomers receive one on one instruction as needed to develop language.  They receive phonics  instruction, have access to listening centers and other technology geared towards supporting emerging language. In addition,  new LEP students are paired with a native English speaker to explain the routines of the day and promote their understanding  of classroom procedures. Newcomers receive the mandated 360 minutes per week.  Developing: Students that are developing receive support in developing their academic language.  Using embedded language  acquisition strategies, the ENL teacher teaches the Targets of Measurement.  Long-Term ELLs: Long-Term ELLs receive targeted instruction based on need.  At the beginning of the year the ESL teacher  determines need based on the base-line assessments.  The ESL teacher follows the English in 3D curriculum designed  specifically for long-term ELLs by Scholastic.  This program integrates all four modalities and academic vocabulary.  Former ELLs: Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL per week and receive extra time on all state and local  assessments.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs with disabilities are serviced per their IEP.  All teahcers know who their ELLs with disabilities are and differentiate for their  needs and use UDL strategies to support all learners. Teachers use the same curricular materials that other students use, but  with modifications that allow students to access the texts and materials at their level. As per the Leading Advanced Literacy  Guide to Promote ELLs' Achievement produced by the DELLs, ELLs and SWDs have access to the same complex texts and  participate in the same critical thinking activities that their peers do. Teachers use language acquistion strategies and scaffolds  appropriate to the activity to support language development. Students use MYON, an online reading program with embedded  comprehension features and read aloud features, to increase reading level.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment according to their IEP.  Curriculum and instructional teams design  units and lesson plans to accommodate all learners.  If an ELL-SWD has a flexible schedule, they move to other classrooms as  needed for instruction.  Many ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT classrooms where there is the support and flexibility of two teachers  in the classroom at all times.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  CIS 303 uses several intervention programs to address the specific needs of ELLs including LLI, Wilson, Rewards, and T.I.A.  These programs are used along with scaffolded instruction and specific skill-based instruction. Students at CIS 303 are offered  academic intervention, resource room, after school programs, speech, guidance counseling, psychological services,  occupational therapy, and nurse care as additional support services, and all services are available to ELLs as well as native  English-speaking students.    Students are placed in intervention programs based on initial diagnostics which include a reading assessment (Fountas and  Pinnell) and a math basic skills assessment.  Based on this data, students are placed according to need. Groupings are flexible  and students may be moved in and out of groups as they progress. In Science and Social Studies, teachers use the reading data  because they are literacy content areas as well.  Interventions in Science and Social Studies include small group instruction  following a push-in model.    The supplemental language instruction program at CIS 303 will focus on direct instructional support in the areas of literacy and  math, in addition to test preparation for the NYSESLAT exams and State ELA and math tests. These specific programs were  chosen based on data provided by student results on the NYSESLAT and State ELA and math exams. For example, after-school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      programs will focus on language development and math skills.  All LEP students and transitional ESL students will take part in  the school-wide State test preparation program along with their native English-speaking peers, but they will also have two  months after these exams to participate in test preparation and tutoring for the NYSESLAT exam that takes place in May.    After-school program for ELLs in 6-8: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 3:15-4:15 pm  CIS 303 will use Title III money to provide an after-school program for ELLs in grades 6-8. The after-school program will take  place three days a week from 3:15-4:15 pm. During this time a certified ESL teacher will work in cooperation with mainstream  teachers to provide supplemental instruction in both literacy and math for ELLs. This program will provide additional support  for students’ language development and reinforce the standards-based math curriculum by focusing on the development of  students’ math vocabulary and basic skills.    After-school NYSESLAT test preparation tutoring for ELLs in grades 6-8: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 3:15-4:15 pm  Starting in March, all ELLs will be invited to participate in an after-school test preparation for the NYSESLAT exam. This  program will take place Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 3:15-4:15 pm for seven weeks prior to the NYSESLAT exam in May.  During this time, a certified ENL teacher will help familiarize students with the test and lead students through practice test  exercises.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on progress reflected in the data, CIS 303 will continue to use the Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention  program to support language development. The improvements that will be made to this program is to tailor instruction in  groups even more to the modality of focus for groups of students (i.e. If the data shows that students need to focus more on  speaking then the group will work on discussion on fluency).     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  CIS 303 uses several intervention programs to address the specific needs of ELLs including Wilson, Rewards, and T.I.A.  These  programs are used along with scaffolded instruction and specific skill-based instruction. Students at CIS 303 are offered  academic intervention, resource room, after school programs, speech, guidance counseling, psychological services,  occupational therapy, and nurse care as additional support services, and all services are available to ELLs as well as native  English-speaking students. Additionally, ELLs participate in Health, Physcial Education, Art and Technology with their native  English speaking peers.

What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL program at CIS 303 utilizes technology in a number of ways to make content more comprehensible for  ELLs.  Technology is used in all of the content areas.  There are lessons delivered using SmartBoards, projectors are used to  model work, listening centers are set up in classroom, students may check-out audio books and there are centers to work on  oral language with a recording system.  Additionally, teachers post webcast and reading assignments on-line with a link to a  read aloud.            13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   N/A     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Support services and resources are leveled appropriately for the students’ ages and levels.  There are high interest libraries in  each classroom that are age and grade appropriate.  All teachers differentiate their lessons to ensure that ELLs are receiving  the same content but at their language level so the material is comprehensible for them. All teachers at 303 provide all  students with rigorous NYS CCLS aligned instruction by using complex texts and making them accessible using scaffolds as  needed (that are removed as students acquire language). Additionally teachers use language acquisition strategies along with  language and content goals to ensure that instruction is aligned to students' ages and grade levels.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Resources and service providers in the building are not shared.            16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students and families are invited to attend the summer orientation session where they will learn about the programs at CIS  303.  At the beginning of the school year newly enrolled ELLs will be assessed and provided with services based on the previous  year's NYSESLAT scores, NYSITELL and the need determined by the school-based assessments.  ELLs arriving throughout the  year will receive an advisor, a student buddy, and will be assessed to determine placement and necessary supports. The parent  coordinator assists the English as a New Language teacher in planning and facilitating family outreach and meetings.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives are not offered.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All classroom teachers, administration and support staff at CIS 303 receive ongoing professional development.  This  professional development includes in-school mentoring lessons and meetings with certified mentors, as well as out of school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         workshops and conferences. Much of this professional development focuses on differentiated instruction in the classroom and  UDL. Because most classroom teachers instruct ELLs as well as native English speakers in their classrooms, this professional  development particularly benefits ELLs by giving mainstream teachers the tools to adapt daily lessons to fit their needs.    The ENL teacher attends a variety of professional development sessions on supporting ELLs on accessing the Common Core  Learning Standards provided by the city and turn-keys the information to the staff (administrators, all teachers,  paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, and secretaries). The ENL teacher supports content teachers in providing entry points  and scaffolds for ELLs.  Additionally, teacher teams meet daily and twice a week these meetings focus on professional learning.  At CIS 303 ENL- specific professional development is delivered during weekly grade team meetings following a PLC inquiry model.  Facilitators  guide teams through the inquiry process using a student work analysis protocol to look at ENL student work. A specific strategy  around language development is identified, modeled, practiced, and planned into instruction. The cycle concludes by looking  at student work, reflecting on practice, and selecting the next language development focus.  Inquiry cycles are facilitated by  Ms. Ros Cooper and Ms. Danielle Lerro.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     At CIS 303 ENL-specific professional development is delivered during weekly grade team meetings following a PLC inquiry  model.  Facilitators guide teams through the inquiry process using a student work analysis protocol to look at ENL student  work. A specific strategy around language development is identified, modeled, practiced, and planned into instruction. The  cycle concludes by looking at student work, reflecting on practice, and selecting the next language  development focus.  Records are maintained through team agendas that include the minutes and attendance as well as inquiry  folders with student work, analysis and all artifacts pertaining to each inquiry cycle.     The certified ENL teacher at CIS 303 also attends in-school mentoring meetings in order to streamline her lessons with the  school-wide literacy curriculum and common core learning standards. CIS 303 is a PROSE school and therefore Professional  Development takes place via job-embedded learning during the school day.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Goals, progress, proficiency assessments and needs across content areas are identified and discussed with parents regularly at  parent teacher conferences. Teacher teams have student conversations, in conjunction with inquiry, about individual students  and share data, strengths and goals for ELLs so that a comprehensive picture progress update can be shared with families.  Families of ELLs are invited to come in to talk to the entire grade team of teachers during weekly student conversations during  the school day.  Parents have a direct line of communication with the student's advisor and are invited in for meetings in to  discuss progress with teachers and the ENL teacher. When necessary, translation services are provided for all parent meetings  (the highest frequency language is Spanish and there are several staff members in the building that are available to translate,  including the parent coordinator).      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The Principal, Assistant Principal, ENL Teacher, Parent Coordinator, Related Service Providers, Guidance Counselor and parents  are all considered “Partners” united in a common goal to see that our ELLs are prepared for High School.  The ENL program at  CIS 303 pays particular attention to increasing parent and community involvement in students’ language development.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Every month there are opportunities for parents to attend workshops.  These workshops are designed to provide additional  information to ENL parents on the school curriculum and ELL-related topics. These workshops will give ENL students’ parents a  chance to ask questions about their children’s work at school and language development, in addition to giving additional  support to parents who may still be unfamiliar with the school literacy or math curricula. A translator will be available at all  sessions to assist parents who do not speak English. Topics for ENL parent workshops include:  -          Workshops on state testing and promotional policy  -          Helping your child gain literacy skills when you don’t speak English at home  -          Curriculum explanations for ENL parents  -          ELL homework help  The Parent Association president and Parent Coordinator work together to invite CBOs to provide workshops at Parent  Association meetings.    Parents are invited to complete surveys, attend SLT meetings and participate in the workshops listed above.  Based on this  feedback we are able to evaluate the needs and plan future workshops and events that will suit the needs of parents.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Monica Brady, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Leadership & Community Ser                                                                              School DBN: 09x303  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      CIS 303 uses multiple methods to determine language preferences for parents and families in written and oral  communication. Surveys to determine what language is preferred for both oral and written communication are  given at the beginning of each year to both new and returning families. This information is kept on file so that  teachers can easily determine the preferred language for each individual student. Additionally, preference is  assessed at parent orientations. Each student has an advisor and the advisor ensures that the appropriate written  communication is sent home and that if oral translation services are needed they are provided. This data is  entered into ATS so that the RHLA report can be utilized.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Arabic   Bengali   Chinese   Dutch           1   3   2   1   .24%   .71%   .47%   .24%   0   3   2   1   0%   .71%   .47%   .24%   3.

We will use Language Line for all non-English/Spanish speakers.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Regular parent surveys are given in both Spanish and English to get feedback and improve on services. As a result of  feedback the school has received, the online grade book that all parents have access to electronically is in both English  and Spanish and monthly progress reports are in both languages. We will use Language Line to read the surveys to all  non-English/Spanish speakers and get their feedback.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72
