The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  PS 145’s Mission Statement states, “Every student at PS 145K will receive a solid foundation for learning through high  quality, standards-based instruction. We are a community of learners where all faculty, staff, students and parents are  actively engaged in the educational process. Critical thinking and communication skills are developed through daily  access to rigorous curricula across all content areas. We create a positive, supportive educational environment that  will develop lifelong learners, ready to be productive members of our global society."     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 145, Andrew Jackson School, is an elementary school with 519 students (94% Hispanic) from pre-kindergarten  through grade 5. The school is comprised of 17% English Language Learners, 15% Students with Disabilities, and 100%  students who are eligible for free lunch.      PS 145 has a number of strategic collaborations, partnerships and special initiatives that are currently being  implemented in order to strengthen teachers’ planning and instructional pedagogy, as well as motivate and engage  students, thereby impacting student learning. These include the following: Generation Ready – provided professional  learning to teachers of English Language Learners to increase pedagogical strategies and develop lessons to increase  language acquisition and Generation Ready Math consultant provided professional learning to teachers of grades 2, 3,  4, 5 on utilizing the Go Math! program to support student learning by strengthening problem solving strategies and  conceptual understanding.       PS 145’s strengths are apparent in the systems set in place to foster high levels of consistency including the  organizational program that affords teachers the ability to work collaboratively, develop and refine curriculum units  and lessons, share best practices, and analyze student work to develop action plans with short and long term goals.  Teachers have common preps as well as a strip on Thursday during which specific vertical instructional teams meet  and discuss student data. Academic intervention is provided in afterschool programs, on Wednesday and Thursday for  grades one through five in our Afterschool Success Academy. This program targets students in the lowest third as well  as students that scored at level two on the NYSELAT exam focusing on language development, reading  comprehension, questioning and discussion development and writing using textual evidence aligned to the NYS  standards. English Language Learners in grades two, three, four and five attend the Afterschool ENL Program focusing  on language and vocabulary development, reading strategies and the writing process aligned to the CCLS. Academic  Intervention is also provided during the school day to small groups in grades one through five focusing on ELA and  grades three, four and five focusing on Math skills and concepts.       PS 145 has implemented the Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS) program which was highlighted in our most  recent Quality Review. This program promotes healthy attitudes and fosters a respectful school culture that supports  students and adults. PS 145 was honored as a "Respect For All" school for the 2017-2018 school year. PS 145 also  takes great pride in building strong family relationships. Our enrichment programs serve as a springboard for opening  the doors of our school to our parents by encouraging them to join us in celebrating their children’s talents and  successes as showcased in assembly programs, concerts and art exhibitions. All this is a result of the efforts of our  teachers, staff and students which demonstrates a culture of trust in the school leading to preparing students for  success and improving students’ motivation and outcomes. The enrichment programs include Glee Club, Soccer Club,  Little Kids Rock Guitar Club, Girls on the Run, and the Green Team as well as the art program Studio in a School.     3.

The professional learning  opportunities will focus on instructional strategies for English New Language Learners, developing comprehensive unit  plans with multiple entry points for ENLs and SWDs, crafting higher order questions, developing the use of technology  to enhance learning activities, increase student engagement and increase student performance. It is noted that the  ENL students and students with disabilities need to increase their language acquisition and discussion skills.  Professional learning activities are facilitated by outside consultants, in-house personnel, or on-line webinars. This  targeted professional learning will build teacher capacity and pedagogy which will be evident in lesson planning and  execution of lessons, student engagement, student work products, and student ownership of concepts thereby  leading to increased achievement     4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on the data from the 2018 Common Core English Language Arts and Mathematics exams across grades 3, 4 and  5, the students performed as follows:   In ELA: As compared to the data from 2017, in 2018 the students in grades 3, 4, and 5 showed a 14% decrease in  students performing at level 1. Overall in ELA, there was a 2% increase in students performing at or above the  proficient level (levels 3 and 4) to 28%.   In Math: As compared to the data from 2017, in 2018 the percent of level one students remained the same. However,  overall in Math, there was a 2% increase in students performing at or above the proficient level (levels 3 and 4) to  32%.   PS 145’s challenges include creating lesson plans that reflect the levels of text complexity, academic vocabulary and  how it is integrated within the questioning, and the expectations for student writing aligned to the NYS standards .  The teachers are also focusing on developing strategies to use with our ELLs such as creating language objectives, as  well as using writing rubrics for each grade aligned to the NYS standards that assess each component of the  standards. With 17% of our students designated as English Language Learners, we also face the challenge of helping  the students master the English language as well as developing reading and writing skills aligned to the NYS standards  . We are facing an additional challenge in our early childhood classes where the majority of students are reading  below grade level. A teacher development coach worked with the teachers to help them develop higher order  questioning leading to discussion in all classrooms. Teachers in grade two through five worked with a math consultant  to strengthen their pedagogy using the GO Math! curriculum to integrate the mathematical practices and go deep  into conceptual understanding.    The DTSDE /Framework for Great Schools tenet that PS 145 made the most growth in during the 2017-2018 school  year is Tenet 6.3 - Strong Family Community Ties. The school has a comprehensive plan to effectively communicate  high expectations and uses multiple tools to provide families consistent opportunities for purposeful, strategic, and  authentic dialogue about school and student issues and concerns. Parents meet with teachers during the Tuesday  afternoon parent engagement block. The school also offers nutrition, diet, music, cooking, movie nights, and other  educational/socialization programs for parents and students. The school shares high expectations through frequent  and timely feedback provided through newsletters, calendars, and school-wide events. The school also uses  "Remind", a system that sends text messages directly to parents' cell phones.    The teachers used a variety of data sources to analyze student progress including baseline assessments, running  records administered five times per year, writing performance assessments administered twice yearly, mock ELA and  Math assessments, content specific culminating and performance tasks in science and social studies. The teachers  analyze data and a variety of student work products during Inquiry Team meetings in order to inform instruction.  Every student in the school has an individual projected goal at every interim benchmark for their Running Record  level. After the assessment is given, teachers review the new data, determine if progress has been made and set  targeted small group instruction to meet the new needs of the students. The teachers developed NYS Standards   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12      aligned unit and lesson plans with multiple entry points for students so that all students had access to the curriculum  in order to support them as they worked toward reaching their targeted goals.    The DTSDE/Framework for Great Schools tenet that is the key area of focus this year is Tenet 3, Curriculum. School  leaders will work to strengthen teacher practice by providing on-going professional development focusing on  formative asessment as well as increasing student engagement by creating lessons utilizing project based learning in  an interdisciplinary curricula. We are also continuing our focus on vocabulary development in all content areas.    Strategic decisions will be made on the use of funding to support improvement of pedagogical skills through ongoing  professional learning leading to increased student achievement as well as improving parent involvement through  academic support workshops in literacy and math, parent-student monthly theme nights, parent engagement  meetings with teachers and Parent As Partners activities on Tuesdays.      5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.   A Turnaround Principle that we will implement in the 2018-2019 school year is providing time for collaboration on the  use of data. We have a vertical team that will meet with the school's data specialists in reading and math as well as  with the administrative cabinet to review on-going assessment data every four weeks. The teachers from the data  team will then meet with the grade level teachers to review and analyze reading and math data, look for trends and  develop action plans. After each cycle the Data Team will evaluate the post data and determine adjustments to  curricula and\or teaching strategies within the classroom. By strengthening teachers' data analysis skills, they will be  able to focus on the needs of their students and adjust instruction accordingly.            2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 32K145   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   576   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In 2018-19 school year, across grades 3 through 5, all classroom teachers beginning in September will meet to analyze  student performance on the Math 2018 State assessment beginning with the June Instructional reports and the item  skills analysis. All students across these grades will be tracked and monitored individually on two set interim benchmark  assessments; Base-line and an End-line in Mathematics. These series of assessments mirror the NYS Standardized  assessments in test design and grade level content covered. After each interim benchmark all classroom teachers across  grades 3 through 5 will meet with their supervisor to analyze student performance by looking at their classes Proficiency  Report categorized by standard to determine individual, class and grade wide, patterns and trends. The teachers will  begin by looking closely at the students who were on their rosters and were assessed in May 2018. The reason they  analyze their own classroom data is so that they can better reflect on their own pedagogical practices and on student  learning outcomes. Teachers will then reflect on how well they knew the content, did they cover the major clusters  necessary based on the Next Generation Standards and what their new Math goal would be for the school year. In  addition, they will reflect and look at the Math mock results to compare and contrast impact on student learning  outcomes based on action plans that will be created based on performance. The upper grade supervisor will conduct  data conversations with individual teachers about student performance to discuss the students that are not progressing  with special attention to SWDs, ELLs and the lowest third.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16      Teachers and administrators have collaboratively decided to continue to have two Math mocks, thereby giving teachers  enough time to analyze testing data, gather resources, work with small groups to reinforce skills and concepts using  teacher created Math games and Math stations.    Although the proficiency level on the 2018 Math exam increased by 2% to 32% at levels 3 and 4, we need to continue to  focus on increasing math proficiency for all students but specifically for students with disabilities and English Language  Learners.   One of our strengths is that administrators, math coach and outside consultant, meet with classroom teachers whose  data doesn’t show student growth to have data coaching conversations about student outcomes on how to strategically  group students, backward plan, and make decisions about instructional next steps. The discussions are centered on  triangulating data collection, data analysis and student outcomes to effectively instruct and impact student learning  outcomes.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, all teachers will engage in collaborative sessions to analyze student work, make strategic adjustments to  instruction based on data as evidenced by on-going formative and summative assessments, student work products, data  tracking sheets, and teacher action plans leading to a 3% increase of the students in Grades 3, 4, and 5 achieving level 2  or higher on the NYS Math Exam.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   PS 145 has established and preserved a Positive Behavior Intervention System to sustain a safe school environment  where teaching and learning can take place with the overarching goal of preparing students for college, careers and civic  life. After analyzing the NYC School Survey 2017-2018, our school community can increase the number of constituents  who feel we provide a supportive environment. Results of the survey show that 81% of the staff recognize disruptive  behavior as a social/emotional learning opportunity but 19% think that only some of the staff recognize this. The School  Survey shows that 89% of the teachers feel that the staff teach students skills to regulate their behavior. As a school  community, we had and will continue to work together to improve student achievement by strengthening the academic  and personal behavior in the light of three guiding principles.    First, we have taken deliberate steps to establish a positive school climate to prevent and change inappropriate  behaviors. P.S. 145 has a School Positive Behavior Matrix to have clear behavior expectations for the entire school  community. A reward system serves as an incentive for students to display positive behaviors. Although, we have  provided training to staff and engaged families on how to promote positive behaviors using the PBIS matrix; there is a  need to amplify staff strategies to manage inappropriate behavior using a positive approach where the culture of the  school continues to flourish and increase the collaboration with local agencies and other stakeholders.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          22      Second, P.S. 145 has set clear expectations and consequences that will help students improve behavior, increase  engagement and boost achievement. Behavior matrices are posted across the school building including a specific matrix  for each setting, bathrooms, cafeteria, schoolyard and gymnasium. The NYC Discipline Code was given to all students in  their home language and student/family contracts were signed at the beginning of the school year. In spite of these  policies, additional efforts are needed to increase the number of staff members trained to assist in behavioral-emotional  escalations.    Third, P.S. 145 has strengthened the staff capacity to ensure fairness by creating a trustworthy environment, however;  we need continuing to establish efforts to prevent, identify, reduce, and eliminate discriminatory discipline and  unintended consequences.    In sum, P.S. 145 will prioritize during this academic year to provide professional development on The Sanford Harmony  Program and Life Space Crisis Intervention to create more responsive classrooms and assistance on behavioral  emotional escalations, resulting in a Responsive School Community.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, all school community stakeholders including classroom teachers, teaching assistants, school support staff,  parents and PBIS Committee will increase the school wide practices of assisting in behavioral-emotional de-escalations  by 5% as noted in the 2017-18 NYC School Survey.

During the 2017-2018 school year , there was a structure of Professional Development for all grade teams that  developed curriculum and strategies for engagement and instruction. Teachers worked collaboratively on tailoring  lesson plans to include tiered activities, creating and sharing scaffolds to meet the needs of all learners. The focus was  building standards-based Units of Study and practices that align with the instructional shifts.    ● One important goal for 2018-2019 is to heighten teacher awareness of providing coherent, and appropriate aligned  standards based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students through the implementation of  project-based learning and focused reflection on formative and summative assessments, and student work products. At  Professional Learning sessions, teachers will continue to review and unpack the Next Generation Standards in order to  ensure that lesson plans begin to integrate the new standards.    ● The priority need is for teachers to focus on Danielson components 3C Student Engagement and 3D Using Assessment  in Instruction. Teachers will be working with consultants in literacy and math to ensure that lesson plans include  multiple points of entry in all curriculum areas leading to increased student engagement.   ●Teachers must also carefully select appropriate scaffolds that are a true support to students, scaffolds that match  students’ needs, scaffolds that are utilized effectively by students and transitional strategies that are implemented by  teachers in order to reduce or eliminate scaffolds as they are no longer needed.

Research-based instructional programs , professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact  change:   School  parents and  students   Sept. 2018  through  June 2019   ● Analysis of attendance data would begin in Summer 2018 to  assess and identify the population; and continue throughout the  year to address prevention and intervention on three levels to adopt  the best practices of the research done by Lewis and Sugai.      Primary prevention to promote pro-social development and      prevent problems by reinforcing the Harmony Program  emphasizing the responsible and resilience attributes across  the entire school community. in addition, to promote  incentives for classes with 100% attendance.   Secondary prevention to address the needs of at-risk  students when they are absent two consecutive days;  consisting on parent call and interviews with students and  parents. We will also print the RSLR report to identify  patterns of attendance across the grades. These families will  be invited to discuss and identify support for families. Tiered  II-90/80%     Tertiary prevention that provides applicable interventions to   students with chronic and/or severe problems, chronic  absentee population will be tracked to identify and address  specific trends causing the absences across the grades; and  intensive outreach to parents of identified students. We will  also have biweekly counseling meetings to ensure  improvement for identified students, participating on the  Attendance Hero Team, Tier III - below 79%       ● School Leaders will continue to build and familiarize themselves  with the various community based organizations in order to provide  families with supports that they need such as housing issues.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● School leaders will also present an attendance overview to  teachers in September focusing on attendance procedures and  protocols.   ● School community will utilize different means to promote  workshops, school activities, attendance updates and interventions  for struggling students to increase parental responsiveness and  involvement including outreach such as the school website, flyers,  newsletters, digital school message board, and text messaging for  parent notifications in English and Spanish.    ●The school will promote a “Be Here” campaign to promote  attendance for all school community constituents, students,  teachers, school leaders and support staff. The school will also  display attendance posters to motivate students such as "If I am not  in school, I cannot learn." We will also have year long attendance  celebrations with tangible incentives such as assemblies, movies,  trips and "Breakfast with the Principal."   ●Monitoring system to track parent attendance and impact through  signing sheets and reflections at the end of workshops. We will also  monitor students of participating families to determine the social  and academic impact on student population.      2.Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities,  English language learners, and other high-need student subgroups:      ● Research states that when school engage families in ways that  improve learning and support parent involvement at home and  school, students make greater gains. (NEA 2002) Therefore an on- going collaboration and articulation between all stakeholders where  all voices are heard, respected and valued to achieve a shared goal  to improve student outcomes will be our priority.    ● Provide instructional clinics for all parent including parents of  ENLs, SWD and struggling students to outline expectations for  students and parents about literacy, science, social studies and  mathematics.       ● Increase outreach to identify qualified parents to lead workshops  as a means to motivate parents to participate in the workshops and  strengthen school-family ties in school community languages.

This will facilitate the increase and responsiveness of parents  to attend to school community activities.    ● Recruit parent volunteers to participate in the Learning Leader  training program to be acquire essential skills to make a difference  in students' lives and connect with their community. They will also  learn educational strategies to use at home with their children.    ● Continue to implement School-Wide Literacy community events to  cultivate parents support and interest in literacy, such as, Literacy  Fall Fest, Read-A-Thon, Author's Night, Poetry Café, Wax Museum,  Let's Go Camping- Literacy Night and Summer Check Outs; where  parents are active participants.    ● Provide extensive parent involvement opportunities in the early  childhood grades, Pre Kindergarten through second grade, to foster  parent participation and familiarity with school community  expectations for all constituents. For instance, monthly events for  Pre Kindergarten parents such as Thanksgiving Fest, Sharing Our  Love with the Community, and Parent Day; and at least two events  for parents by grades.    Provide parent involvement opportunities that cultivate high  expectations for students and encourage college awareness such as  Career Day where parents can share their career paths with  students.      ● Utilize Tuesday Parent Engagement time to provide additional  opportunities for parents to attend workshops led by clusters in  specific areas such as, computer literacy, Discovery Zone (STEM),  Music Parent Child Connection (music teacher), and Stronger Ties  (counseling focus on attendance).      ● Elicit from teachers ideas and topics on instructional practices that  parents can learn during workshops and utilize at home to develop  strong partnerships centered on student work products as measured  by a Common Core aligned rubric.       ● Providing parent incentives for participation in workshops,  particularly those parents of the identified chronically absentee as  they improve their yearly attendance with a trip to Adventureland.       2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● Organizing culminating activities to celebrate student participation  in CBOs that include parents such as assemblies for participants in  Mighty Milers, parent-student family literacy night or poetry café,  and Cookshop student/parent contest based on healthy recipes           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   If  any,  list  the  Community  Based  Organizations  or  other  partnerships  that  support  parent/family  and  community  engagement.

Since many of  these students are performing below grade level, they will be invited to our Afterschool Academy and/or Saturday  Academy for additional support. We will also provide AIS services during the school day for these students who need  additional academic support. Historically, students in temporary housing have attendance issues so we will reach out  to the families if we see that the students are absent. We will meet with the families to see if any outside support is  needed and we will also provide incentives for the students to come to school. Title 1 Set-aside funds will be used to  provide basic school supplies for students in temporary housing as well as providing them with grade appropriate  reading materials in a take home backpack.The Guidance counselor will also ensure that the students receive support  through in-school counseling as needed.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Strategies to attract high-quality teachers include recruitment of potential candidates at job fairs, review open market  application process, contact with Universities and colleges, and recommendations by staff members and colleagues.  Establish a relationship with Bilingual Pupil Services to recruit student teacher interns. Administrators will interview  candidates by asking focused questions that talk to the understanding of differentiating instruction, assessment and  teaching and learning philosophy.   Applicants and administrators will engage in conversations about the instructional programs conducted, the strengths  of the school, and professional development support that is offered. Strong candidates will be invited to conduct a  demonstration lesson to gauge teacher and student engagement. Strong candidates will also be invited to complete a  writing sample to demonstrate written communication skills. Teachers are recruited and assigned based on the  certification and license areas needed.   New teachers are paired up with highly qualified mentors who provide thorough support. New teachers are  periodically allotted extra time on task with their mentors on a need basis. Support for new teachers includes  immediate intervisitations to view best teaching strategies modelled by experienced and dynamic teachers. New  teachers will reflect on practices by utilizing the school 3-2-1 protocol. The protocol highlights; 3 things learned, 2  things to try and 1 wondering.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   High-quality and ongoing professional development for teachers, principals, assistant principals and staff will be  provided through a variety of sources and strategies. Ongoing Network/Borough support is provided for our teachers  to support English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. Our Math coach will focus on planning based on  the needs assessment of the mock exam results. Data specialist will support school-wide progress monitoring across  all content areas. The in-house Professional Development is planned by the SDC committee and selections are based  on surveys of teachers and paraprofessionals which are collected three times a year. The workshops are centered  around City-wide Instructional Expectations, collaborative professional learning, maximizing digital learning, and  Danielson Components 3C Engaging Students in Learning and 3D Using Assessment in Instruction, Curriculum   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Alignment-Common Core vocabulary, and instructional needs grouping and goal setting. These professional learning  sessions are organized with specific cohorts of teachers based on needs of the students and school goals. These  professional learning sessions are presented by classroom teachers and they highlight strategies that have proven to  be successful, such as classroom lab sites, in-class coaching, demonstrations, inter-visitations, study groups and on- line courses. Administrators also participate in City-Wide and CSA professional development in educational  leadership.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  P.S. 145’s school culture is to provide a strong system and structure for the entire community across grades to achieve  higher academic standards. Our Pre-Kindergarten students are exposed to the rigorous Core Knowledge curriculum  where they are expected to meet or exceed the Pre-K CCLS across academic and social-emotional areas. The  instruction delivery and expectations are similar to upper grades. In addition, Pre – K parents are invited to workshops  emphasizing the CCLS, Standard Based Instruction and many instructional initiatives twice every month.    During the month of May, parents are invited to participate in classroom visits, meeting with Kindergarten teachers,  and are provided with information about how to assist their children to be ready for Kindergarten. For those parents  who have children with disabilities, we offer the support of the school guidance counselor, social worker and other  staff members to communicate their concerns to in order to attain a level of comfort in making the transition to  Kindergarten.   In addition, the school psychologist, social worker and teachers engage in the Turning Five process, facilitating and  strengthening conversations with outside educational agencies, day care centers and families of those children who  are planning to attend Kindergarten in the upcoming year.    These activities for parents will include special services, meeting key personnel, visiting possible educational  environments where their children may be placed and many other supports.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     As part of the school initiative, P.S. 145 utilized the Teacher Effectiveness Team to analyze and share the different  options in selecting assessments that will result in impacting student performance. All teachers examine the pros and  cons of a menu of assessments before making the decision. Some key areas they took into consideration during these  conversations were teachers’ familiarity with the assessment, the alignment of the assessment with the curriculum  and CCLS, and time management.    In addition, the Staff Development Committee meets monthly to delineate professional development based on  teachers’ professional needs to impact student performance in assessments. The SDC reflects on the professional  development impact and effectiveness to identify areas of improvement ensuring the highest possible results in a  trustworthy environment.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          56     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          57         funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 145, The Andrew Jackson Elementary School , in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 145, The Andrew Jackson Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          59      ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before Nov. 15, 2018 to advise parents of children  participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          60      program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections  under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The tools our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our Ells are Core Knowledge unit assessments and Fountas and  Pinnell, periodic running records.  These tools test decoding, word recognition and comprehension and writing.  We use this  data to create action plans for our students in order to strengthen small group instruction.  We utilize  Wonders/Maravillas specifically in the Dual Language program, to gauge reading skills and decoding in Spanish Language.  We  also use the Primary Literacy Assessment.  These assessments are utilized for flexible grouping on a daily/frequent action plan.  Writing is assessed via Spanish/English writing performance tasks.  At the beginning of the school year, each student is given the TCRWP running records. According to this data, 86.05% of our  ELL students in grades 1 through 5 scored at level 1, 6.98% scored at level 2, 1.15% scored at level 3 and 5.81% scored at level   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          72         4. Based on this data, ELL students are grouped accordingly during small group instruction, ELL students receive AIS support  during the school day as well as instruction during the ELL After School Academy.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teachers' lesson plans include procedural, verbal, and instructional scaffolds and exit tickets are used to form flexible  groups with English proficient students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To evaluate the success of our Ells, we look at several factors, standardized ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies tests,  NYSESLAT results-how many students moved up a level, “Mock” tests to see growth, Running Records, school report card,  participation in after school and articulation with cluster teachers.  Lesson plans reflect specific scaffolds for Ells.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Depending on the ELA need, we look at the student data and create 6 week action plans to target instruction.  Emphasis is  placed on schema building and supporting oral and written communication.  The goal is to deepen content/not conflate  language ability.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data such as NYSESLAT, ELA, Math and other performance tasks to determine which Tier of Instructional  support to provide our Ells.  The students who fall into Tier II and III are enrolled in the Afterschool program or are provided  RTI during the school day with an AIS provider.  They are all given priority in these programs.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT revealed that after two years in a DL/ESL program  students were able to transfer their skills and knowledge into their second language in Writing and support was needed to  advance in speaking. As part of the schoolwide goal we will continue to work on developing student language and reading  comprehension through assimilation of academic and domain vocabulary in all content areas by providing sentence  prompts/picture scaffolds and opportunities for viable discussions for students at all  proficiency levels; Entering, Emerging,  Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding.   There was a drop in the number of new students enrolling in the school, and of those who enrolled 32 were tested with the  NYSITELL and 10 were eligible for services.            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The EDAT is distributed in the beginning of the year to set goals and determine by modality where most to least support is  needed.  This guides the teachers' instruction.  We have a graph that the ENL providers use as their guide.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          73         a.  Freestanding ENL program.      Our organizational models consist of   Dual language, ENL push in,  Freestanding ENL.    In our push-in ENL program,  ELL students spend most of their day in a mainstream English classroom.  The push-in  program is implemented through a "team teaching"  and "team planning" that requires the regular classroom teacher  and the ENL teacher to plan on a regular basis.    In the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year we added one more  ENL teacher to meet the demands of the new CRPart 154.2 mandates.  Integrated instruction is delivered by the ENL  teacher through content instruction-language arts,math science, social studies. In our ENL program content areas  (math, Science and Social Studies) are delivered in English by the teacher using pictures, graphic organizers, charts  with realia, computers, baskets of books in the students native language, peer buddies, performance task, smart  boards, and other proven methods to make content comprehensible to enrich language development.     Depending on the 5 levels of English proficiency the units of study can be combined with Stand-Alone ENL or  integrated ENL. The Former ELLs up to 2 yrs will receive (2 units of study) 90 minutes per week in the form of book  clubs with our licensed dually certified ENL librarian.   In our Freestanding English as a Second Language classes which  exists in the Second and Third grade, all academic instruction during the school day is in English by licensed ENL  teachers.  The core content areas are taught using ENL strategies and methodologies.  The objective of this program is  to have ELL students immersed in the English language in order for them to become fluent and literate in the second  language.  They also receive support in the native language; each of these classrooms have a small library with  Spanish books, glossaries, Spanish dictionaries, sentence starters and scribe pens.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      NA    c.  DL program.  If applicable.       Our DL program is a developmental, language-enriched, Bilingual education program that integrates students who  are native English language speakers with native speakers of Spanish.   Students receive half the instruction in English  and half in the target language Spanish.  Language is taught through content areas as well as Literacy.  The model that  is used is for grades K-2 is the alternate week model.  Students learn to read and write and receive instruction in other  disciplines in both languages.  The goal is to develop Bilingual and Biliterate academic goals in both English and  Spanish for all students.                   In Grades 3-5 there is the Roller coaster method, where half of the day’s lesson is in English and half is in Spanish. The  next day, the schedule is inverted. If the day before English was taught in the morning and Spanish in the afternoon,  then Spanish would be taught in the morning with English in the afternoon.  A lot of factors go into determining which  grades will use which model.  First there is the logistics, like class sizes. If there are not enough ELLs with parental request, the side-by-side model  can’t be used, due to budget constraints.  We have a good amount of bilingual certified teachers qualified to teach in  both languages.  The Roller coaster method was put in place to accommodate testing grades and materials.             2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              We added one more licensed ENL teacher to provide ENL services for the ELLs.  Among the two teachers we will  strategically program the correct amount of units and the types of ENL that is mandated.  Their programs will reflect for  example; for an Entering student, 360 minutes (180 minutes of Standalone ENL and 180 of Integrated ENL/ELA).  Transitioning  student (90 mins integrated ENL/ELA and flexibility of 90 mins standalone or ENL with content area.  Expanding student (180  integrated ELA or other content area)  Commanding student (90 mins-integrated ENL/Content area or other approved former ELL service for 2 yrs.       2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          74      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Free Standing-The class  receives instruction in English as a group and is heterogeneously grouped.  Each lesson targets  Learning Objective and Language objective.  The lessons are Tiered to reflect multiple access points inclusive of verbal,  instructional and procedural scaffolds.   The teachers utilize strategies/materials such as realia, visuals and multi- media.  Lessons include; Close interactive read alouds, collaborative discussions and language frames for speaking and writing.            ENL Push-in-The teacher plans in conjunction with the classroom teacher.  The teacher scaffolds activities according to  our mandated school curriculum and material; Core Knowledge K-2  nd   grade, Expeditionary Learning grades 3-5, Disciplinary  Literacy-Science and Social Studies , and Go math.  The ENL teachers push in and use strategies such as;  TPR, Deconstruction  and Reconstruction of complex text, graphic organizers, discussion prompts, and open-ended questioning.         DL-  The teacher scaffolds activities according to school's English curriculum-above mentioned .  The material is aligned in  Spanish with a combination of teacher created Spanish material and authentice Literature and Spanish -Science & Social  Studies content technology and Spanish Go Math program.  As part of Spanish word work for grades K-2, the  Wonders/Maravillas program is used and the students are assessed after specific benchmarks.      For Grades k-2, the language is alternated on a weekly basis.  The flow of the Day is Read-aloud, Core Knowledge-Skills,  Guided Reading Lunch Disciplinary Literacy -Science and Social Studies(Read and Write) and Math.    For grades 3, 4 and 5 the Roller Coaster model is practiced.  For the Roller coaster model the Flow of the Day is the same  everyday: Read aloud/skills, ELA /NLA Expeditionary Learning Program, Guided Reading Lunch  Math and Disciplinary Literacy- Science and Social Studies.  For example, on a given week Monday: English morning , Spanish afternoon, Tuesday: Spanish  morning, English afternoon, Wednesday English morning Spanish afternoon…etc.                   4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       As a school administrators collect benchmark assessments three or more times a year.  Progress is tracked and teachers and  administrators discuss action plans and next steps by looking at formative assessment:  small group instruction grouping  sheets and conference notes.  Progress is monitored via the Spanish Writing Performance Tasks, Spanish Running Records and  Math unit tests.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. During this current year we do not have SIFE students.  However, our instructional plan for SIFE students include support in  L1.   Students receive extra support through technology that assists in using decoding and comprehension.  b.  ELL students less that three years receive differentiated instruction by proficiency level through both whole group and  individualized.  Provisions for modeling and demonstrations are provided.  Materials include books on tape, laptop listening  centers, visuals, and smartboard.  These students have priority for the after school program.  Lesson plans include specific  differentiation including, verbal, instructional, and procedural scaffolds.  c.  ELL students receiving services 4 to 6 years we provide differentiated instruction emphasizing reading and writing strategies  across content areas.  These students also receive extra periods of AIS.  Student work is closely analyzed by inquiry teams to  close the instructional gaps and provide additional support.  d.  These students are provided with Tier III interventions and academic intervention service support and discussed in the /RTI  meetings.     e.  Our plan for continual support  for our former ELLs we will provide the 90 minutes a week via Book Clubs with our dually  licensed librarian.       2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          75      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies used to provide access to academic content and accelerate English language development are;  small group instruction, one to one instruction, peer collaboration and content based research groups and Disciplinary  Literacy.  Teachers engage in revisions of units to identify how to better utilize instructional scaffolds and to determine when  to use appropriate types such as: Verbal-(Wait time, prior knowledge, think a loud) Procedural- (explaining task, role playing,  guided practice, pairing groups, coaching) Instructional-(Pictoral, words cards, sentence strips..etc)                   7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of Ell-SWD as follows: All ELL- SWD's parallel their general education peers in curricular and instructional materials.  The materials are adapted and modified  as per the linguistic needs of this population.  In addition, assessments are modified so that ELL-SWD 's have more time hence  scheduling flexibility is achieved and our students do not feel frustrated if they cannot complete the task.  Flexible scheduling  also takes place via mainstreaming of ELL-SWD's with non ELL-SWD's  as per IEP stipulation.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs in ELA, Math and other content areas are open to all ELL subgroups.  The intervention is  provided in English and /or Spanish by the classroom teacher during differentiated instruction and extended day.  The cluster  teachers OTPs also provide intervention during the school day.  Intervention activities include Reading and Math during the  day.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       We will begin the Wonders/Maravillas program for Dual Language in grades K, 1, and 2. Teachers College will be implemented  in grades K, 1, and 2.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no programs discontinued.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are offered the afterschool  program via supplemental services which is supported through Title  III funds.  ELLs participate  in extracurricular activities such as: Glee club, Band and  Enrichment Cluster based on an interest survey.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     All ELLs, regardless of subgroup receive the same materials.  All ELLs attend computer lab.  We utilize MYON in English and  Spanish in the after school program.  Brain POP is used in both languages to support Science and Social studies.  News-o- matic is used to support and build nonfiction reading skills.  Math is supported through Go Math and Mathletics.    We offer  special computer lab time for parents and students of ENL during parent engagement Tuesdays.  We are always searching for  new scaffolds- the latest is the scribe pens that our alternate language paraprofessionals and teachers use with the  students.  Our ELL teachers have special laptops with headphones as a listening center-as part of English support-STAR  FALL.  Scribe pens are used to support reading and listening skills       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home Language is supported by fiction and non-fiction books in our DL program.  New Common   core Aligned Authentic Literature and Content Area books have been purchased.  In our Dual and ENL classes, students have  glossaries, dictionaries and Spanish content vocabulary.           2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          76         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All required services support and resources correspond to Ells' ages and grade levels using differentiated  instructional  strategies.   An intervention program "Starfall" to support vocabulary development is used in the classroom in form of  technology.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       Not Applicable. We do not share a building.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled students are given a tour and orientation of the library by our librarian  Ms. Felipe.  Our guidance counselor and parent coordinator set up a meet and greet and show how to access the schools  monthly newsletter      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not applicable.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    Our DL program is a developmental, language-enriched, Bilingual education program that integrates  students who are native English language speakers with native speakers of Spanish.   Students receive  half the instruction in English and half in the target language Spanish.  Language is taught through  content areas as well as Literacy.  The model that is used is for grades K-2 is the alternate week  model.  Students learn to read and write and receive instruction in other disciplines in both  languages.  The goal is to develop Bilingual and Biliterate academic goals in both English and Spanish for  all students.

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   Strategies to address the needs of student English Language learners, and other high-need student sub-groups:  •     Identify resources and structures to support teachers’ understanding of types of scaffolds (e.g., web videos on ADVANCE,  teacher team meetings, inter- visitations, Engage NY articles specific scaffolds for Ells and SWD).   •     Administrators will visit each teacher’s classroom over the course of the year for observations, and provide teachers with  feedback specifically matching student work products with relevant scaffolds and discussing how well students utilize the tools  during independent or group work.     Classroom teachers and clusters who service Ell’s, F-Ells will meet in 6 week cycles during Monday PD time.  Our ENL teachers provide demo lessons and intervisitations.  •     The priority need is for teachers to focus on Danielson  components 3B and 3C, Questioning and Discussion and Student Engagement. Teachers need to craft higher order questions  that lead to curiosity, debate, and discussion. Learning activities are to be developed that encourage student choice and  motivation and that are “minds on”.  •     Teachers will carefully select appropriate scaffolds that are a true support to students, scaffolds that match students’  needs, scaffolds that are utilized effectively by students and transitional strategies that are implemented by teachers in order  to reduce or eliminate scaffolds as they are no longer needed. Teachers of English Learners will also focus on creating language  objectives to integrate within their lessons in order to strengthen language development in students.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    •     A series of workshops to target new Part 154.2/.3 mandates of providing 50% Pd for all teachers and 15% for ENL teachers  •     ENL PD will include effective practices that; connects previous learning for language support  including “chunking” and  “webbing” to make information manageable, cooperative and interactive activities, multiple access points, low risk  environment practices which promote high self-esteem in order to improve student outcomes.  •     “Try and Share” follow-up sessions will be planned to consolidate new initiatives so all voices are heard for the purpose of  gauging “new and best practices.”  •     Responsibilities will be delegated to empower teachers and other staff member to build capacity and keep best practices  alive throughout the year cohesively among all stakeholders.  •     School leaders establish a common lens and language to provide feedback in informal and formal snapshots.  •     The data collected through these frequent cycles of observations will be used to plan additional professional development  for teachers by teachers.   Record will be kept in school-wide PD binder.  Certificates will be given to new teachers who need mandated hrs.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      We have a PTA which meets monthly and there is parental involvement as part of our School Leadership Team which apprises  parents of curriculum, budget and projects.  We hold workshops according to parents’ needs and requests.  Our parent  coordinator, Arleen Lopez seeks different agencies to come to our school to provide workshops on parenting and  nutrition.  During the fall, we send out surveys to find out what programs parents are in most need of.

We have educational trips to “Repertorio Espanol ” and New York City  Landmarks.  Parents are kept informed through our calendar and school website.      The needs of parents are evaluated by using questionnaires, surveys and by parent request.  Often the parents come to the  school and speak to the parent coordinator and relate the types of information they would like to receive.  The Principal and  AP's also have an open door policy.    When translation is needed the parent coordinator coordinates with the Office of Translation to provide support.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school.

This year a cohort of teachers in grades 2, 3 and 4 who work with ELLS received job-embedded support in ELA and mathematics  from consultants from Generation Ready.  The consultants focused on shifts in education of ELLs, specifically the shifts in planning  and offering of learning opportunities.  Teachers focused on language acquisition, high expectations for ELLs and high levels of  support.  The consultants also worked with the teachers on using formative assessment in lessons and then using data from the  assessments to inform instruction.                         2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          79   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Linda Malloy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          80                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 145 The Andrew Jackson Elem                                                                              School DBN: 32K145  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       YES     * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      PS 145 uses a variety of data sources to determine language preferences of parents. The ENL coordinator runs the  ATS report RHLA four times a year. This report shows that 331 families prefer to communicate in Spanish, 381 in  English, 1 in Chinese and 1 in Thai. Information is also culled from the HLIS when students are registered. Blue  Emergency cards are completed and updated three times a year during Parent Teacher conferences and home  language is noted on these cards. Teachers are in constant contact with parents as part of the Tuesday Parent  Engagement time in order to determine how to best meet the needs of the parents in terms of communication.  Letters that are sent home to the two families (Chinese and Thai) can be sent to the translation unit for written  translation. Teachers also can provide the parents with the translation and interpretation brochure.   At P.S. 145 every letter, calendar and any parent notification written in English is translated into Spanish which is  the native language of the vast majority of our parents and sent home. All parent meetings are conducted in  Spanish and English. Our parent coordinator, Ms. Enid Burgos, is fluent in languages as well as the Guidance  Counselor, Ms. Nerina Rodriguez and the Family Worker, Ms. Nancy Ponce who translate all written materials to   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          82      ensure parent involvement and understanding. All three Assistant Principals provide support in both languages.  Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our  school community. We share information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other  activities in a format, and in languages that parents can understand. In addition, schedule additional parent  meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share  information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to  provide suggestions by translating all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and  events as needed. We utilize the Home LangugageSurvey (Parent Information) data to ensure that we provide  translations in written and oral form based on their chosen language request. Furthermore, we use current data  from meetings, parent teas, Family Fridays, Parent Teacher Conferences, PTA meetings and workshops to  determine language necessities. In some case where there is a need for Chinese/Cantonese translation (for one  newly arrived student) we elicit support from a volunteer parent whenever possible.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written  Preferred       Percent  Written       Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The ATS report RHLA shows that 331  families prefer to communicate in  Spanish, 381 in English, 1 in Chinese and  1 in Thai in both written and oral  communication.              3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.               Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          83      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   plan to   Families    translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.          At PS 145 many of our staff members are fluent in Spanish, they are  able to provide oral and written translations on the spot and when  necessary in written form in a timely fashion. The Spanish written  translations of materials and resources sent to parents are done in- house for all documents that are sent home in advance so that  parents remain informed and up-to-date on school initiatives which  affords them with the opportunity to participate or attend an  upcoming event, function or workshop. The following documents are  translated in both Spanish and English and backpacked to all parents  either by our Parent Coordinator or Family worker: Monthly calendar,  weekly announcements, student progress reports, afterschool  information, letters from School Leadership. The newsletter which is  on the PS145 Website is translated by our School Librarian. The  Monthly calendar is also enlarged, laminated and placed in the main  entrance for all to see.           2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   plan to  provide   interpretation   service(s)?          Formal face-to-face meetings occur in September as Family Night  (Meet the Teacher), Parent Teacher Conferences in November and  March, and Evening Conference in May to discuss student progress.  Parent Engagement time is also on Tuesday afternoons of every  week. For the Tuesday parental support there is a schedule binder  and any classroom teacher who needs one to one translation elicits  support from our key staff members. The guidance counselor and the  school Psychologist are in constant communication for student  updates on progress and student needs. The attendance teacher and  Family Worker work hand in hand in communicating with individual  parents on a daily basis.            2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          84     3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.                  Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                   Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      PS 145 will fulfill Section V11 of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation service by sending home all notices and letters in both Spanish and English. We will also  communicate to parents during parent workshops, PTA meetings, parent teas, parent teacher conferences and special  events in both English and Spanish. In addition, current information will be displayed on the outside billboard. The  brochures and Language "I speak…" Cards will be introduced and information disseminated to the teachers at the  September Welcome back meeting and before the two parent teacher conference days so that parents can be made  aware of over the phone translation and interpretation assistance. Parents' Bill of Rights are disseminated to parents  at Parent Teacher Conferences throughout the year in both Spanish and English. Parents will be given access to the  Department of Education website which provides information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights  of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access the services.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We constantly elicit feedback from parents on a monthly basis at the School Leadership Meetings and at our Dual  Language meetings and information gathered from surveys and verbal feedback from monthly parent workshops and  daily parent intake forms that filter through our Parent Coordinator and grade specific supervisors. Feedback from  parents is also ellicited from our PTA through meetings and events held at the school.         2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          85
