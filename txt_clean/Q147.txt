The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      Ronald McNair –PS/MS 147 Vision and Mission      The staff of the Ronald McNair School provides our students with a nurturing learning environment and a rigorous  curriculum. We are committed to providing educational experiences that will enable students to meet or exceed the  standards through tasks which require critical thinking, encourage a collaborative approach and lead students to  become independent learners.       We are committed to knowing students as individuals and providing instructional approaches which meet the social  emotional and academic needs of every student. We will provide instruction in core subject areas with a specific focus  of writing development.       We believe the arts are an important component in the educational process and will provide students with a  standards based approach to learning the arts.       We set high expectations of all stakeholders to work together to achieve our instructional goals. Academic excellence  and good character are essential for developing successful students ready for college and future careers.      To fulfill our Vision and accomplish our Mission, it is essential that we know our students. We do this in several ways:                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/MS 147 has close ties to its school community. We have a partnership with New York Junior Tennis League. New  York Junior Tennis League provides an after-school and summer program for students in grades 6-8. In addition to  learning how to play tennis, students learn other sports, dance, theater arts skills, and receive homework assistance.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Our students are our ambassadors to the community. Students in grades 3-8 participate in Student Council. Students  lead school wide and community events through our outreach efforts. We continually increase our partnerships  within the community. Our school band, chorus, Rockets Step Team, Rocket Competitive Team performed and  interacted with the participants of the Alpha Phi Alpha Senior Citizen Center, the Cambria Heights Community Church,  the Cambria Heights Public Library, Community Parades and other venues.       Meeting the social emotional needs of students is a large part of our school's culture. We have worked with  Morningside Center to train our staff on Restorative Practices. Our students in Grades 6-8 participate in weekly  Restorative Circles. Our elementary teachers have been trained in Sandford Harmony and use it daily. These programs  help students and teachers to cultivate strong, healthy classroom relationships.       The population of PS/MS 147 is approximately 590 students comprised of the following:   1.  English Language Learners: 4%  2.  Students with IEPs: 13%;  3.  Asian: 1%  4.  Black: 94%  5.  Hispanic: 3%  6.  White: 1%   About 68% of the student population are free lunch eligible. There are a total of 35 children in temporary housing.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with disabilities (SWD) in Grades 3-6 and Grade 8 scored below the City average on the NYS ELA. Students  with disabilities in Grades 3-8 scored below the City average on the NYS Math. Students in self contained classes need  support in meeting the standards in ELA and Mathematics.             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past year we have made the most progress with building a supportive environment for our students and  staff. We believe the classroom must support the social and emotional growth of students while promoting high  academic expectations.       We have done extensive work around creating a Supportive Environment. We believe the classroom must support the  social and emotional growth of all students so we can make academic progress. Our staff has been trained to support  the social emotional needs of students using Brain Power, Restorative Practice and Sanford Harmony.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      An area of focus for the 2017-18 school year will is to Engage Students in learning. We believe engagement in learning  happens when learning tasks have multiple correct responses or approaches and/or encourage higher-order thinking.  We are using the professional literature (Rigor is Not a Four Letter Word) to come to a common understanding of  what rigor is and what rigor looks like for all students.       Another area of focus is for students with disabilities to make academic gains. An analysis of test data indicates that  our SWDs in self-contained classes in Grades 3-8 have not made proficient gains.       Our instructional focus for 2017-2018: Students will communicate their knowledge of new learning by engaging in  speaking, listening and writing tasks in all subject areas, in order to provide evidence of their learning in discussions  and various written tasks. Resulting in the improvement of the quality of student writing across all content areas.                      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q147   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   593   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

When we receive notification of student seat  offers, we begin our information series that includes Open House events to provide information about our Pre- Kindergarten and Kindergarten programs, expectations for student achievement and academic and personal  behaviors that will build a foundation to support college and career readiness work.    Local universal Pre-Kindergarten providers work closely with Borough Support staff and school staff to evaluate  students who need early intervention for academic or social emotional needs. The Pre-K social worker works closely  with school staff and parents to recommend and provide early intervention services.   The teachers of Pre-Kindergarten, (PK), will work collaboratively to develop PK CCLS aligned units of study that  provides rigorous instruction and develops the social emotional skills needed to succeed in school. . The teachers of  PK implements the school-wide instruction focus and monitors progress through various assessments.   PK students and their parents are invited to PK Open House events, PK Orientation, and parent workshops. All parents  are invited and encouraged to attend parent involvement workshops. The PK social worker also works with school  staff to provide family events and parent workshops during the school year.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Several assessments are needed to gain a clear understanding students performance levels.      School-wide assessments are selected by the school Curriculum team and MOSL committee.       Classroom assessments are created collaboratively by teacher teams to align with current units of study from Go  Math, CMP3, Ready Gen, and Codex. Go Math, CMP3, Ready Gen, and Codex were selected through teacher  discussion and consensus.    Teachers also have Schoolnet as a resource for instructional and assessment materials.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44      Administrators, Curriculum team members and MOSL committee members attended professional development  sessions. The MOSL committee and Curriculum team members submits their recommendations to the Principal and  shared their work process and decisions with the staff.    During professional learning sessions, teachers work collaboratively to analyze NYC Performance assessment results  and use the results to purposely plan to improve instruction. Teachers also analyze student work collaboratively to  build an understanding of their students and to provide appropriate interventions to close student achievement gaps  and provide enrichment.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Ronald McNair Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Ronald McNair-PS/MS 147, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part  A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [Ronald McNair-PS/MS 147] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages (Haitian/Creole and Spanish) that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   PS/MS 147’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained             Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  PS/MS 147 Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted  on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the or  Parent-Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing  professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator or a  dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who  attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The  Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report  with the central office.;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent-Teacher Association and Title I  Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      Ronald McNair-PS/MS 147 School-Parent Compact   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   [Ronald McNair-PS/MS 147], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

The program is designed to provide ELLs  with two levels of access to the task that are required for the 2014-2015 school year:  language  access and content access. The program will use research based strategies and techniques to  provide explicit instruction to introduce essential vocabulary and language functions.  The program will serve the following sub-groups:  ELLs (0-3 years), ELLs (4-6 years) and long  term ELLS (completed 6 years) in grades K through 8. There will be a total of 30 ELLs in our  program.  The Saturday ESL program is scheduled to begin January 2014 and will run until April  2015 from 9:00am until 12:00pm.  English will be the language of instruction.  One ESL  certified teacher and two content teachers (ELA and Math) will provide instruction using various  teaching techniques. Some of the teaching strategies that the teachers will be using are the  following: interactive lessons with hands-on actvitities and cooperative learning, intergration of  language skills, thinking skills, and content knowledge and providing encouragement of  creativity and discovery of new things. Teachers will ensure that they are using BICS to carry on  basic conversation, understanding speakers. We will use CALP so that the students succeed in  their academic classrooms. This includes problem solving, inferring, analyzing, synthesizing,  and predicting. The program will use purchased research-based instructional materials that  support the common core focus for 2014-2015. Materials that will be use are as follows: National  Geographic Reach for Beginners and low-Intermediate ELLs. This program will assist in  learning academic vocabulary, focus on reading and writing strategies and help teachers to have  a better selection of reading passages. The program English At Your Command will be used for  the high-Intermediate/Advanced ELLs. This program will focus on how to use visual tools and  graphic organizers, vocabulary guides for choosing the right words and a highly visual guide to  grammar usage. Also, Continentals's New York ELLS  will be used to help prepare students for  the NYSESLAT in K-8. One certified teacher will provide instruction for the Beginner/low- Intermediate group and the other certified teachers will provide instruction for the high- Intermediate/Advanced group in content areas. The ESL teacher will co-teach 90 minutes with  the Beginner/low-Intermediate group then  co-teach 90 minutes with the high- Intermediate/Advanced group.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55           Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                          To assist students in developing proficiency in mathematics and literacy,  teachers will  continue to receive training in the use of CCLS standards during weekly PD sessions, developing  and scoring tasks.  The ESL teacher along with an administrator will continue to receive  Network training on topics such as: using linguistic frames to improve oral language and  building academic language through informational texts. The ESL teacher will use the  knowledge of the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT to differentiate the instructions as needed  according to their scores. The students will be grouped according to the levels in which they  were idendified by the respective exams. Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced will be grouped  for leveled needed instructions. A pre-test will be given at the beginning of the program and a  post test will be administered at the end of the program. Each three to four weeks, the students  will be assessed to determine possible growth.  Professional Development will be provided for  teachers by the Assistant Principal and/or ESL teacher. The professional development will occur  on Mondays during the time allocated after school and a half an hour on Saturdays after the  program ends. The certified ESL teacher who will be conducting the Saturday Academy will be  present for the professtional development. Some of the topics that will be addressed are as  follows:   - Learn specialized strategies to differentiate instruction for English Language Learners at a  variety of proficiency levels  - Understand the affective needs of newcomer ELLs and learn strategies to address their needs   - Develop an understanding of the specific language and literacy needs of a newcomer English  Language Learner.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We currently use Fountas and Pinnell to assess literacy skills using pre-tests and post-tests. Data gathered from these  assessments allows us to assign students to the reading level based on their abilities. The assessments also allows us to  evaluate the strengths and weaknesses students have in a specific skill and then design our instruction to their needs. We also  use the Go Math Unit pre-tests and post-tests to assess math skills of all students in grades  K-2. All students participate in the  fall and spring MoSL in ELA and Math to help access growth and weaknesses in that subject area.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60         All ELL's are in the same class on a grade.  The ENL teacher pushes in the class room to support students with class work and  pulls students out to work on individual skills. The ENL Teacher uses scores from Fountas and Pinnell, Baseline and Benchmark  assessments to help drive instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYC performance Tasks, Content area baseline assessments and benchmarks.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL teacher analyzed the data from assessments and provides small groups instruction to students     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Provide all staff with professional development on using data to drive instruction, implement interventions, and create Title III  plans for ELL students.  Within the Title III plan ELL students participate in an afterschool and Saturday intervention program.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores as well as other relevant data(begining, middle and end of year Performace Task) will help us  make adjustments to the ELL program.    The use of the ELL Data Analysis Tool gives us a detailed analysis of the NYSESLAT.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher will review the data and meet with all teachers who service ELL students.   We provide those staff members  with professional development on using this data to drive instruction, implement necessary interventions and readjust Title III  plans as needed.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The two different types of ENL programs offered at PS/MS 147 are the following:  Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core content area  instruction.  Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually  certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area  teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction  include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs  up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.  We want all the students to be comfortable in their instructional groups as they learn English. In order to ensure that  our ENL program is a success we incorporate two different models:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61         Push-in model: an ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to provide  language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or  prior collaborative lesson planning.  Pull-out model: ELLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction are brought together from  various classes for English-acquisition-focused instruction. ENL teachers need to plan carefully with general education  teachers to ensure curricular alignment and continuity of instruction.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All ELL students in our building either receive 360 minutes (entering), 360 minutes (emerging) or 180 minutes (transitioning  and expanding). Each period is 45 minutes long. The entering students have eight 45 minute blocks per week (180 integrated).  The emerging students have eight 45 minute blocks per week (180 minutes integrated). The transitioning and  expanding  students have four 45 minute blocks (transitioning 90 minutes integrated and expanding 180 integrated). The ENL  teacher designs the schedule to ensure that all students receive their allotted time.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students are primarily taught in English in all program models. The ENL teacher uses ENL methodologies to ensure  understanding and success with content material. The ENL teacher pushes into classrooms to help support content areas and  align instruction to the CCLS standards. The ENL teacher tries to incorporate prior knowledge and connections to the  student(s) native language to foster language development.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   N/A: At this time we do not have a Bilingual program at PS/MS 147.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The focus when working with SIFE is to close the gap these students have, by assessing their level of knowledge and working to  bring them to grade level performance standards. Instruction is focused on extending the students' vocabulary and  understanding through the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing in the content areas. In addition to the  mandated weekly minutes, SIFE have the opportunity to join our after school programs/Saturday programs that is designed  especially for their needs. When working with newcomers, we build on their prior knowledge while acquiring English as their  new language. An important component is assisting these students in understanding the new culture while honoring their  cultural identities. When working with the students who have received ENL services for over four years, we focus specifically  on those skills they are lacking. By analyzing data (classroom assesments and local and state data) from a variety of sources,  we are able to indentify the specific standards and skills the students need to improve. Using item analysis we are able to use  differentiated instruction to focus on those skills. Long term ELLs are offered extra support through the Title III program. The  Title III program provides instruction in Math, ELA, Social Studies and ENL. The program is monitored by the certified ENL       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      teacher and the adminstrator of ELLs. Former ELLs are also welcomed to attend these programs to help strengthen their skills.  Former ELLs receive .5 unit of study per week of intergrated ENL in ELA/Content Area, or other approved Former ELL services  for additional years.  All of our ELLs and former ELLs receive testing accomodations for all classroom, city and state exams.  They are provided a serperate location, time and half, translated copy of the test when applicable and word-for-word  glossaries.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The materials that are provided to classroom teachers to support their ELL-SWD students are laptops and desktops with  specialized programs installed and additional books purchased to deepen their knowledge of English. The ELL population uses  the same programs/text books/materials that the rest of our school population uses because they are required to take the  same formative and summative tests.  Our school offers the Wilson program and Fundations for struggling students and  students with IEPs.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ELL-SWDs IEP is followed closely to provide the services they are entitled to and accomplish the goals on the IEP. When  able, ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT classes so they can interact as much as possible with non-disabled peers. Criteria used to  place these students in this setting are based on their strengths and weaknessess. Through articulation between the licensed  ENL teacher and classroom teacher the planning for the student is collaboratively done. The ENL teacher will either push in or  pull out based on the ELL-SWDs needs to differentiate instruction. ELL-SWDs also receive RTI and AIS services.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS/MS 147 offers a variety of intervention programs in all content areas. All services are provided in English. The intervention  services the building provides are available for our  ELL population who may benefit from it. Programs such as AIS, RTI, and the  Learning Leaders programs target students who are performing below grade level or are just approaching grade level. ELLs  receive services in these subgroups by the ENL teacher using ENL strategies tailored to their specific needs. Other programs  such as the after scool and Saturday programs in both Math and ELA target those students who are at or above grade level.  ELLs that are at or above grade level are welcomed to join those programs as well.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are considering having a After School Program and a Saturday ENL program for the upcoming school year contingent upon  funding. We believe those students, who take advantage of the programs are able to perform better in the classroom and  state tests.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A: No bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are offered all the services that are offered to all monolingual students in the school. We encourage all of our students  to participate in all school activities during or after the school day (example: clubs and sports). Parents are sent translations of  letters sent in English in order to participate in all activities done within the school. We also use the phone messenger system  to send recorded messages in the home language whenever necessary. Parents are also encouraged to approach bilingual staff  in our school if they do not understand something in English.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use technology to support our ELLs. We have purchased the National Geographic Reach program that has an online  interactive program for our ELL students by proficiency levels. The ENL program has laptops specifically for the program and  the students also have access to laptop carts in each classroom. Our teachers use smart boards to help engage student  learning and to provide visualization support.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We currently do not have a Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual program at this time. The ENL program offers glossaries in  different subject areas, peer tutoring among students, buddy system for many of the newcomers and teachers who are able to  speak the home language of the students. We also use staff members or the Translation and Interpretation Unit for language  support with parents and students.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELL students are invited to all school activities that are appropriate for the age and corresponding grade level.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS/MS 147 has a co-location with D75 PS/811. We do not share staff or resources at this time.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We encourage that our ELLs participate in all activities our school community offers. The parent coordinator and our teachers  ensure that all activities that the school has throughout the year includes the ELLs by sending out invitations to the parents (in  their preferred language). The parent coordinator distributes a monthly calendar that has all school events for that given  month listed.  Also monthly PTA meetings are run by staff members and parents where important events and upcoming news  is discussed.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    t the middle school level we offer Spanish as a foreign language.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A: We do not have a Dual Language program at PS/MS 147 at this time.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided to teachers of ELLs throughout the year. When possible, the ENL teacher attends  professional development sessions that are provided through the Office of ELLs. A minimum of fifteen percent of the required       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         Professional development hours for all teachers prescriped by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, best  practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS/MS 147 meets the professional development requirements as per CR PART 154  by dedicating workshops on language  acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for  English language learners. Some topics that will be addressed are the following: What is different about an IEP from an English  Language Learner, Language Difference or Learning Disability, Co-teaching and Collaboration, Maximizing Learning  Opportunities for English Language Learners and Building Academic Literacy for ELLs. Attendance and agendas are distributed  at all professional development workshops and are kept on file with the ENL teacher and the Assistant Principal.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS/MS 147 provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELL students to discuss goals of the program, their child's  language development progress, their child's English language proficiency assessment results, and language development  needs in all content areas. The elementary and middle school conducts their meetings and ensure that all content areas are  present including the ENL teacher. An interpreter/translator (a staff member) is present so communication between the  parent/guardian and staff is clear. If a staff member is not present for translation the interpretation unit is called. The time and  date are at the discretion of the teacher and parent/guardian.Attendance records are kept for each annual individual meeting.  One staff member is assigned to take notes about all topics addressed and distribute to the rest of the content teachers and/or  service providers at the conclusion of the meeting. To request an annual individual meeting a letter or phone call is made to  the parent/guardian.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ncreasing parental involvement is one of our main foci at PS/MS 147. Parents are updated on a regular basis about their child's  progress in school through quarterly student progress reports. During their visits parents are informed on what assessments  were given and how their child has performed.  Communications with our ELL parents and involvement are done many  different ways. Notices are sent out to inform and invite them to take part in school functions. These notices are sent home via  the students with a translated version in the language of choice filled out in the HLIS. The parent coordinator Mr. Pressey also  implements the use of the school messenger that is able to connect all our ELL parents through phone, text or e-mail in any  language. Moving forward we would like to have workshops offered in Haitian Creole to parents more frequently. The needs of  the parents are evaluated on a regular basis. At PS/MS 147 we strive to keep the door of communication open.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.                 2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65                         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Afua Hill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Ronald McNair School                                                                              School DBN: 29Q147  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We use the UPPG screen in ATS to determine parents' translation needs. This information from Part III of the  Home Language Survey determines what language the parent or guardian would like to communicate or receive  information. The parent coordinator also requests that the parent/guardian fill out a parent survey for preferred  language of communication. We also have Emergency Contact Cards (blue cards) printed from the DOE website to  retrieve pertinent information from parents/guardians. Teachers meet with parents to determine appropriate  translation needs.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69     2.

Chancellor's Regulation A-663 will be reviewed and distributed to all staff during September 2017 opening  conferences.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      The majority of our parents who do not speak English speak Haitian Creole. Notices are provided in Haitian Creole and  English. We utilize our bilingual staff members to engage in meetings. We use the translated notifications that the  Department of Education provides. We will utilize the translation services whenever necessary or when our staff is not  able to provide service. PS/MS 147 fulfills the Chancellor's Regulations by providing parents a copy of the Bill of Rights  and Responsibilities whose primary language is routinely translated by the Department of Education. Also we post in  all primary entrance locations that we have interpretation services available.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will have a parent survey to gather feedback from our parents/guardians of the quality and availability of services.  Our parent coordinator and ENL teacher will design the survey. Recommendations/changes will be brought to cabinet  meetings for discussion.              2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72
