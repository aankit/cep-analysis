This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the Leon M. Goldstein High School for the Sciences is to enable students to reach their highest  potential while gaining and enhancing an appreciation of the sciences as well as to pursue lifelong learning, to apply  learning to life, and to contribute positively to their communities enabling them to become caring, productive global  citizens.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Leon M. Goldstein High School for the Sciences @ Kingsborough Community College, CUNY , is a four year high  school (grades 9 -12). The school is located in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. Leon M. Goldstein High  School for the Sciences is a public school under the administration of the New York City Department of Education.   LMGHS was opened in September 1993 by former New York City Mayor David Dinkins and the late Leon M.  Goldstein, who was President of Kingsborough Community College for 28 years; the high school was later renamed  in his honor. LMG is located on the northern part of the campus of Kingsborough Community College of the City  University of New York; it overlooks Sheepshead Bay, Jamaica Bay, Rockaway Inlet, and the Atlantic Ocean. The  school is housed in a building designed for LMGHS, built by the NYC Department of Education, and opened in  September 2002.   Every year approximately 250 students enroll. It offers students an excellent college preparatory academic  education. LMGHS was rated one of the best public high schools in New York City by New York Magazine and #191  out of over 1600 high schools nationwide by Newsweek Magazine.    Goldstein has collaborative partnerships with Kingsborough Community College (KCC), and is able to use many of  its facilities (i.e.: the theaters in the Performing Arts Center (PAC), the Marine Arts Center (MAC), the college  library, the KCC Art Gallery, the gymnasium, the waterfront, etc.). Leon M. Goldstein HS offers College Now classes  for both juniors and seniors (students opt into the course in their junior year and all senior students are mandated  to take two College Now classes in their final year of high school). These programs allow high school students to  take college courses and earn college credits from CUNY while in high school.   Goldstein has state of the art facilities, and puts great emphasis on technology. The school has computer labs (all of  which are equipped with Macs) on every floor, and at least one computer in every classroom. All classrooms in  Goldstein are also equipped with a Promethean interactive whiteboard. This allows classes to be much more  interactive due to access to the amazing information and communication features of the Internet in classrooms.  Due to this high connectivity, teachers use the school website to post homework, and utilize Internet innovations  such as blogs for homework and other assignments. Using this 21st Century technology fosters further academic  discussion among students and teachers. LMG also offers technology savvy students the opportunity to join the  Tech Squad to assist the school's computer technicians in maintaining school computers and equipment.   In order to meet the basic requirements to qualify for a diploma, students must complete four years of English,  Science, Social Studies, Mathematics, Physical Education and elective classes; a total of 44 credits are required for  graduation.

Goldstein High School has a wide variety of varsity sports teams including a basketball team, swimming  team, bowling team, soccer team, wrestling team, tennis team, girls volleyball team, and boys golf team. LMG has  an active cheerleading squad called the “Boosters”; they play a key role in fostering school spirit and are present at  most major school sports events. A popular school athletics tradition is the annual Students vs. Faculty game;  basketball is primarily the chosen sport. The school's mascot is the dolphin, a very intelligent sea mammal and  ancient symbol of the sea and intelligence. Dolphins are sometimes sighted in the waters near the school during  the warmer months of the summer and early autumn.   LMGHS has an active student government, which is elected every May. The school maintains positions for  President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and student representatives from each grade. There is also a Senior  Council composed of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and two cabinet members. The Senior  Council is responsible for organizing Senior events, voicing concerns of the Senior class to the administration, and  keeping the Senior class informed. Student representatives are also elected to serve on the LMG School Leadership  Team.   The LMG School Leadership Team consists of representatives from the school administration, parents, teachers and  students. The SLT meets monthly to discuss and work on issues related to implementation of the school’s mission  and vision.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As we have now completed the sixth year of the citywide initiative aimed at providing equity of access to all learners,  we now have a sizable amount of students with IEPs (nearly 20% overall). As such, modified instructional practices  which include multiple entry points are required (among other actions) for their success. All course-related supports  that may be required are offered at Goldstein High School (SETTS, ICT, and self-contained classrooms).      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction: We’ve been very successful and are most proud of our ability to expand the amount of rigorous  course offerings ( provided to our students – we’ve now doubled the amount of Advanced Placement course offerings  for our students and have mandated all students to take two CUNY College Now courses during their senior year.   Our next step aligned with this achievement, and a key area of focus for this school year is to ensure that of our  learners are provided with these opportunities to ensure that all of our students leave our school college and career  ready.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 22K535   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1011   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Leon M. Goldstein High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community..      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Leon M. Goldstein High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Not only do we use the NYSESLAT scores from the previous year to assess our students’ progress, but we also administer a  base- line exam in September. This exam is designed in house with a focus on all four modalities. The test includes: 1.  a lecture  with multiple-choice questions to evaluate listening skills  2. a writing sample and a grammar section to evaluate written  expression proficiencies 3. reading passages with comprehension questions to assess reading comprehension weaknesses  4. a  speaking section.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   All students take base-line exam and a group plan is made to address the needs of the class as a whole and individual issues  are noted to be addressed during individual practice time. Using the September assessment, the 2 weakest modalities are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      selected to be focused on. In September of 2016, 4 students received 35% or less on the reading exam and 2 students got low  scores on the writing section of the exam. Therefore, we opened the year focusing on reading strategies and having students  practice these strategies as they read a short novel, and then, we set up independent writing activities. During these activities,  individual problems were diagnosed and students worked to learn to identify these mistakes and self- correct. Finally, as the  year unfolded, we designed units to address the needs identified by not only the base-line assessment but also subsequent  mini assessments. Moreover, these mini periodic assessments are given in each modality to see if progress is being made. The  first informal assessment for 2016 showed growth in questioning, inferring, making connections between outside sources and  the text and summarizing.  These periodic assessments can be either formal or informal, but the data gleaned from them is  used to design curriculum that will address areas of weakness and to reinforce skills that will ensure progress.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We are using the NYSESLAT, our own baseline assessment and periodic assessments. Moreover, if a student is in the 10th or  11th grade, we also use at the ELA and Global Regents and all summative classroom assessments to define areas that need  improvement. For 9th graders, we give 4 periodic assessments throughout the year.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The BESIS coordinator reviews the RLAT and the RNMR to see whether the students advanced one level in two consecutive  years or gained 43 points if the student remained on the same level. She evaluates the progress or setbacks in each modality  using the RNMR report. Using this data, our BESIS coordinator uses that information to design individual and group  instructional goals.  Moreover, she reviews all transcripts to see each student’s yearly progress in both Math and ELA. All this  information is reviewed with the students when they are setting their goals and reflecting on their progress.  In addition, the  BESIS coordinator reviews the goals set and the data from both the RLAT and the RNMR with the guidance counselor and the  parent during the annual review. Finally, the ELL teacher individual meets with each ELL student to revisit his goals, adjust  them and evaluate progress bi-annually.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We collect and review summative assessments such as the NYSESLAT, Regents, base-line assessments and periodic  assessments. Yet, since our program is small, it is difficult to see patterns, but our special needs ELLs are struggling with the  challenging curriculum and the new CC Regent exams.  After reviewing the data, our BESIS person shares the data from these  various assessments with the Committee for at Risk Students and the APs who turnkey the data to the content area teachers  who work with ELLs. The APs offer opportunities to these professional content area teachers jointly to work with an ELL  teacher to modify lessons using strategies which enhance the ELLs' comprehension and access to disciple specific content and  language.   Moreover, co-teaching teams, a content area teacher and ELL teacher, use the data to adjust and design  instruction.  Moreover, at LMGHS, we have started to run sheltered self-contained content area classes. Our committee that  focuses on at risk students proposed these classes to assist ninth grade special education students and special education ELLs  to learn study and organizational skills and basic math and reading skills.  These classes with their focus on literacy across the  curriculum and organizational skills have helped students acclimate to high school and be successful.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT and Regents are used to inform the ELL program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The evaluation of the ESL program is done annually. The LAP team reviews student data, the NYSESLAT, the Periodic  Assessments and informal classroom assessments to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. The team also  reviews the goals that were set the year before and evaluates whether they were achieved. Then, new goals for the next year  are set and an action plan to achieve those goals is created. These plans are shared with the Committee for At Risk Students  and co- teaching ESL-content area teams and feedback is requested.   Finally, the LAP committee concretizes the goals and  action plan and distributes them to each ESL- content area co teaching teams.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   For our ESL program, all transitioning, expanding and commanding students are served in integrated ESL/content area  classes either in the English department or the Social Studies department.  All students are grouped heterogeneously  according to proficiency levels and homogeneously according to grade level.  All SE transitioning and expanding 9th  and 10th grade ELLs will be served in a heterogeneous ELA class taught by a dually certified teacher with no more  than 2 contiguous grades (i.e. 9th and 10th).   Entering and emerging students will be served in heterogeneous stand-  alone ENL classes of no more than 2 contiguous grades (i.e. 9th and 10th).     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At present, we do not have a transitional bilingual language program.  However, in the future, if our population  changes, we will create the necessary programs and program accommodations.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At present, we do not have a dual language program.  However, in the future, if our population changes, we will  create the necessary programs and program accommodations.          2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     For our commanding level ESL students, we provide two sessions of ENL/Content Area instruction.  Each session runs 57  minutes and a certified ESL teacher is pushed into the content area class for those two sessions. For our transitioning and  expanding level ESL students, we provide one integrated ENL/Content Area class which runs four times a week for one fifty-  seven minute session. These students are served in either an ENL/ELA or ENL/History class with a dually certified ESL/ ELA  teacher or two teachers- one certified in SE/History and one in ELA/ESL.  In 2017-18, we do not have emerging students, but if  we did, we would provide one single ENL class which would run four times a week for one fifty-seven minute session and one  ENL/ELA or ENL/History class which would run four times a week for one fifty- seven minute session.  The stand-alone ENL  class would be taught by a dually certified ESL/ELA teacher and the integrated ENL/History class would be team taught by a  certified SE/History teacher and an ELA/ESL teacher. At present, we do not have any entering ESL students. However, if that  changes, we will provide 3 units of ESL: one stand-alone ENL class, one ENL/ELA class and one ENL/Content Area class.             The ESL/ ELA class, taught by a dually certified teacher (ESL/ ELA), follows the follow structure.  • Day 1: (Single Band- 57 minutes): Group instruction (20 minutes- modeling), group, pair or individual application (25  minutes), group share (12 minutes); biweekly independent reading with journaling and conferencing with individual students  (57 minutes).  • Day 2: (Single Band- 57 minutes): Group instruction (20 minutes- modeling), group, pair or individual application (25  minutes), and group share (12 minutes).  • Day 3: (Single Band- 57 minutes): Group instruction (20 minutes- modeling), group, pair or individual application (25  minutes), group share (12 minutes); monthly independent writing and conferencing with individual students (57 minutes).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      • Day 4: (Single Band- 57 minutes): Group instruction (20 minutes- modeling), group, pair or individual application (25  minutes), group share (12 minutes); monthly sessions of either independent vocabulary development or listening practice (57  minutes).            The ENL/Content Area (History) classes are team teaching classes but at times use parallel teaching and complementary  teaching strategies effectively to support all ELLs.            One teacher who modifies instruction and monitors the progress of all ELLs in her class teaches the ENL/ELA classes.            As mandated by CR Part 154, commanding students are receiving the 90 allotted minutes of ESL instruction, the  expanding and transitioning students are receiving the 180 allotted minutes of ESL instruction. When we have emerging  students, they will receive the 360 allotted minutes of ESL instruction per week. When we have entering ELLs, they will receive  the 540 allotted minutes of ENL instruction.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     Language and content objectives are clearly defined and reviewed with students. When required, supplementary materials are  used and content is adapted to suit the students' proficiency levels. Students engage in meaningful activities which emphasize  key vocabulary and which build background linking past learning with new concepts.  Multiple techniques and modalities are  used to make content concepts clear while teachers provide ample opportunities for students to practice learning strategies  and break into scaffolded materials. There is frequent opportunities for discussion and for students to clarify key concepts with  hands- on activities that integrate all language skills. Assessments are also created to suit students' academic levels and to  develop skills that will improve their language proficiency. When intervention is required, students are supported so they feel  capable and respected.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All testing is done in English. If a Regents exam is administered in a native language, a grader with the appropriate license in  the content area and the language will grade the exam. If the school needs to reach out to a school in its network for this  assistance, it will.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. For SIFE students, we diagnose any literacy issues such as confusion with sound- symbol correspondence, difficulty  distinguishing between sounds not in their native languages, difficulty remembering sight words, lack of awareness of  sentences and paragraph formation and lack of use of capitalization and punctuation. Then, we set up an individual  instructional plan such as using the Wilson reading program to strengthen phonetic knowledge and develop the memory of  sight words. If a bilingual paraprofessional is required to help the students, we request one.         b & c. The instruction in the ENL/Content Area classroom is common core standards based where a cohesive integration of  ESL/ELA and ESL/History objectives, assessments, and student performance drives curriculum design. Students’ needs and  deficiencies are addressed individually or in whole class mini-lesson  instruction.  Teachers address many topics such as text complexity and break-in strategies, inferences and main ideas, reading  strategies, paragraph development and unfolding, listening and note- taking, and testing strategies. Moreover, all four  modalities are used to teach these topics.  Weekly, we work on listening, reading comprehension, and written expression  skills. Teachers create learning environments where students engage in accountable talk, use a diverse assortment of graphic  organizers and do a series of complex tasks that have been scaffolded to allow for successful practice and content knowledge  and language acquisition.  Secondly, based on the review of data from the reading and writing portions of the NYSESLAT and  other student work, students are guided to work on individualized reading, speaking, and writing programs, which let students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      work at their own pace and address their own needs.   The expectations of the independent reading, speaking and writing  programs are clearly defined and the programs allow students to avoid needless repetition and to focus on the mastery of core  concepts.  Finally, during whole group instructional time or parallel teaching time, the ESL teacher models skills and strategies  that ELL students will practice during their independent sessions.  All projects require students to deal with multiple modalities  on a challenging level and in an integrated format. Also, content area based units allow for development of schema and  activation of prior knowledge.     d. At present, we have 5 long term ELLs. All of these students are special needs students. Their weakest areas are the reading  and writing modalities. The NYSESLAT exams are reviewed annually to determine the weakest modalities. Once the data is  evaluated, curriculum is designed according to the needs of the students. Formal and informal periodic assessment tools help  the ELL teacher refine and alter curriculum design throughout the term to enhance student learning. The long-term ELLs, as  the students discussed in section b & c, have a Common Core based curriculum where assessments and student performance  drive curriculum design. As listed above, students have individualized reading and writing programs as well as whole group  instruction. Moreover, the 9th and10th grade long term ELLs receive a grade-appropriate ICT ELA class or a self- contained ELA  with a literacy focus in addition to the literacy-based ELA class where they receive their ESL services. All the 11th and 12th  grade long term ELLs are scheduled for an ICT ELA class in addition to a US History/ESL team-taught-class where they receive  their ESL services. Finally, within the literacy- based US History/ESL classrooms and the ELA/ ESL classrooms, reading and  writing strategies are scaffolded and modeled each day and the students are required to practice them when reading  documents and stories and writing about their discoveries. Finally, academic vocabulary and breaking in to complex texts are  major focal points for these students.    e. For the former ELLs, since we have so few on each grade level, we have devised individual programs for each ELL. The  teacher and former ELL student design these programs. Nonetheless, the student is serviced in a content area class where a  general education teacher teaches for four bands a week and an ELL teacher team-teaches for 2 bands of that week. The  former ELL fills in an initial survey when the team-teaching course begins and the ELL teacher collects data from writing  samples, the survey and observations of the student's speaking, reading and listening performance. Then, together the ELL  teacher and the former ELL set up goals and work towards them. The teacher scaffolds work for the former ELL when required.  Moreover, the BESIS coordinator works with the guidance department to track the progress and growth of the former ELLs.  Progress reports are sent to all teachers of former ELLs and the guidance department and the BESIS person review these  reports to see where they should intervene to support the students academically. The guidance counselors follow through on  organizing interventions such as peer tutor referrals, after school tutoring referrals, Regents tutoring referrals and requests for  class and subject buddies.  If a student is at risk of failure in one or more classes, the student is required to meet with his/ her  guidance counselor weekly to address organizational, motivational, academic, and social needs. As part of the weekly  meetings, the student is required to set goals and self assess his/ her achievement of the goals.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   There is a focus on discipline- specific vocabulary, scaffolding of tasks, and modeling of writing and reading strategies for all  content area subjects. One-on-one tutoring, glossaries for content areas, and simplified reading passages are also used in  content area classes.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Out of our 8 ELLs and 7 former ELLs, there are 15 with special needs. Two of our ELL students are in self-contained ELA classes  and 6 are in ICT ELA classes. While 5 of the former ELLs are in self-contained ELA classes, 2 are in ICT ELA classes. Secondly,  these 15 students are provided with special individual programs in the ELL/ELA or US History classrooms. Moreover, schedules  are modified based on language proficiency. A student with less language proficiency and a strong math background will be  scheduled for a chemistry class versus a living environment class. Other scheduling modifications are made according to  individual needs.  Independent courses of study to enhance or to provide remediation are designed to support each student's  language growth. Alternative assessments such as i-movies, non- fiction reading journals, and visual essays are all used to  support content knowledge access and development.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs include peer tutoring in a student's native language or English, Regents tutoring, after school  tutoring in all content areas, and a guidance counselor with whom students meet to set goals and track progress. Finally, other  types of programs offered by our school to support our ELLs and former ELLs include AIS, counseling, referral for related  services, parent conferences to develop action plans, referrals to community agencies, targeted instruction, student  assessment analysis (organized by the guidance office) and pupil personnel committees. Most of these services are provided in  English, but if translation services are required, they are sought out. In 2017-18, more than half of the incoming special  education ELLs will be scheduled for self-contained content area classes that promotes study skills, basic literacy skills and  basic mathematic skills.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        There may be 2 changes depending on the budget. First, we would like to have a reading specialist work with the ESL teacher  to help develop a more streamlined reading program to build comprehension skills for all the ELLs and former ELLs. Also, we  would like to establish stable co-teaching teams, so teachers can create better, more targeted curriculum with language and  content goals.   10. If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We are a one-program school and all students are eligible for all course offerings and programs. All students may apply for AP  courses and electives with the approval of their teachers and with a willingness to work hard. Special programs are also run to  support students who are struggling in core content area subjects. All freshman ELLs are eligible for these classes if their skills  are limited. Because of the size of the ELL population, there are few after school programs that are specifically geared to ELLs.  However, all tutoring and after school programs are available to ELLs. All clubs, sports teams and extracurricular activities are  open to all. LMGHS has a Latino club, an Asian club, a Jewish heritage club, an annual cultural fair, a black student union, a  movie club that shows movies from all over the world, a respect for all club and many other activities to make ELLs feel part of  the LMGHS community.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classrooms have smartboard technology which means all classrooms have internet access. Streamed materials and visual  and audio materials are available for use in all classrooms.  Audio book and audio textbook access is available for many of the  schools resources. Also, there are new computer carts which can be used in all classrooms in the school. There are computer  labs where music and HTLM courses are taught. Finally, some ELLs have been given IPADs and laptops, so they can have texts  read to them and so they can work on organizational skills.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We only have an ENL program, but peer tutoring supports students who want to maintain their native languages and plan to  take a Regents Exam in their native language. Peer tutoring with this goal in mind is strongly encouraged and the guidance  office usually pairs students in study teams when students show interest.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All curriculum and activities are designed with ELLs' ages and interests in mind. Texts such as Mango Street are read to discuss  the larger issues of home and the immigrant experience. Clubs and the International Day are promoted to encourage unity, a  welcoming tone, and to allow ELLs to share their experiences, cultures and talents.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building, but if we do in the future, a plan to share resources will be created.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In the last 7 years, we have neither had new ELLs nor ELLs who enrolled throughout the year.  If a new ELL enrolls or  matriculates mid-year, the parent coordinator, the guidance counselor and the BESIS coordinator will ensure that the student  is welcomed. Secondly, the BESIS coordinator with the help of the Parent Coordinator sends all relevant flyers about city  summer programs for ELLs to incoming ELL students. Also, we have a club fair with many clubs that might interest our ELLs  such as the Asian club and the Spanish club. For the past six years, we have had an international day to introduce world  cultures. This year, the Social Justice class will hold forums to spark conversations about race, ethnicity and justice for all.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We only offer Mandarin and Spanish at the school. Because of scheduling issues and because many of our ELLs are special  needs ELLs, most ELLs do not take a language class until they have passed out of the ESL program or until they are in the 11th  grade.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    At this time, LMGHS does not have a dual language academy.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Since Leon M. Goldstein High School only has one licensed ESL teacher, all opportunities offered within our network are  reviewed by the ESL teacher and by the administration and the teacher of ELLs is encouraged to attend. Moreover, the ELL  staff is encouraged to attend workshops offered by the Department of Education and share the information received with the  entire staff. The school works hard to ensure that fifteen percent of PD for all teachers is ELL specific and fifty percent of PD for  the ESL/ENL teacher is ELL specific.  Finally, many of our staff actively pursue professional development opportunities offered  by local chapters of NCTE, BETAC, TESOL, NYSABE, the NYC public library, and the Office of English Language Learners.        Since there is only one ESL teacher working with ELLs, professional development is outsourced. The ELL teacher is encouraged  to attend programs run by District, State and National organizations whose focus is ELL education. All teachers, whether  content teachers or the ESL teacher, are  encouraged to attend these programs.  The ELL committee which is made up of the  ESL teacher, the content teachers and paraprofessionals that deal with ELLs spend portion of the professional block sharing  best practices and discussing critical articles and texts about ELL methodology such as the SIOP model, text complexity,  dictation methods, empowerment and language acquisition and cultural literacy.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.         The size of our program and the diversity of our LEP population affect both instruction of the ESL population and PD  opportunities for the staff.  The implications for PD can be as simple as informing the staff of the ESL population at the school  or as complex as sharing ESL methodologies with staff and helping them incorporate them into their lesson plans.  At one of  our faculty conferences, an ESL staff member reviews the Regents modifications for ELLs and former ELLs. At a series of  department meetings and ELL committee meetings, PD topics may include:  Common Core Standards,  differential instruction,  rigor, grading and achievement when teaching ELLs and students with special needs,  and  student self-assess. For formal  department meetings and staff meetings, agendas are distributed and filed with the AP. For PD sessions minutes are taken and  filed with the committee facilitator. At all these meetings, attendance is taken and the records are filed with the AP. As per  Jose P., each general education staff member is required to fulfill their seven and a half hours of ELL training and each teacher  of Special Needs students is required to fulfill their ten hours of ELL training.  All staff members turn in proof of their  completion of this course. Because of the heightened awareness that these conferences bring, many members of our faculty  anticipate and accommodate the needs of our ESL population by setting up peer tutoring, by modifying tests, by working  collaboratively on teaching units with the ESL staff and by using modified teaching methods to assist and support ESL students       Parental Involvement      1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?         Annual conferences are set up by the designated ELL guidance counselor. If a translator is required, one is sought out  whether it be an in-house translator or a translator via speaker phone from the DOE translation service hotline.  The ESL  teacher, the guidance counselor, the parent and student are all invited. Also, if possible, one content area teacher will be  present. At the meeting, the results of the NYSESLAT and the opening periodic assessment are reviewed with the student and  parent, goals which the student and ELL teacher have set are evaluated and refined and any concerns about content area  subjects and language acquistion issues within those subjects are shared. If required, adjustments to the goals and the  language development plan are made by the ESL teacher and the student.         Records of attendance and letters distributed at the annual meetings will be filed in the guidance office. The designated ELL  guidance counselor will keep a record of all her meetings, phone calls and correspondence with each ELL parent in the  students' files. All informal records of conversation with parents of ELLs will be recorded in Filemaker under the ELL note  category.                  2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.         The parent coordinator and the Leon M. Goldstein School staff encourage and seek out parental involvement. At our  September Parents' Evening, we have set aside an hour reception for the parents of ELLs and Special Education Students,  the  teachers of these students and the students.  This is an opportunity for the parents to meet the staff working with the children  and for the teachers of ELLs to welcome the students  and parents of ELLs to the LMGHS community. At this initial meeting, we  ensure that a few translators are available and tell the parents which languages our staff members speak.  Also, we inform the  parents about the DOE translation service which will allow them directly to communicate with their child's teachers.  Moreover, the parent coordinator will distribute important contact information, show parents the translation button on the  school website and introduce staff that the parents can contact if they have concerns. In May at the last Parents' Evening, the  BESIS person and the parent coordinator will be available, so the parents of ELLs, the teachers of ELLs and the ELL students can  meet with them.  At these meetings, the ELL teacher and the parent coordinator will ask for feedback about whether the  parents felt informed and included in the LMGHS community and what changes would help them feel more involved and  knowledgeable about their child's progress.  Moreover,  our Parent Coordinator has set up a phone messaging system and an  e-mail database to inform parents of upcoming events and Parent Association meetings.  She has put together an informal  network of people to translate letters and call ELL parents keeping them abreast of events and their children’s progress.       All our parental involvement activities are designed based on the data collected through surveys and Parent Association   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         meetings. Annually, activities are set up for all parents including parents of ELLs by the Parent Coordinator based on the data  collected concerning parents' needs. Workshops to which ELL parents are invited include: Internet Safety, Choice and  Consequences: Teen Drinking and Driving, Bully and SAT Prep. More workshops and activities include: The Process of College  Admissions and FAFSA: Step by Step. Finally, PTA meetings, College Information Night, Financial Aid Night, sports awards, the  winter and spring concerts, the musical revue, the cultural fair and other student centered activities involve all parents in the  school community and the ESL staff and the parent coordinator encourage all ELL parents to attend these events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Scott Hughes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Leon M.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      1- We have all incoming students complete the NYCDOE Language Preference Form.   2- Families also articulate this when they complete the Blue Emergency Contact Form.   3- The parents of students arriving at Goldstein HS from non-DOE schools complete the HLIS.   4- We regularly review Home Language data stored in ATS (e.g.: RESI report)           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58     2.
