This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our school mission continues to be at the center of our daily commitment to increase student’s outcome and success:    “Horace Greeley’s mission is to provide every student with the skills, academic knowledge, emotional    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      support, and values needed to compete and succeed in the 21 st Century. We are committed to the belief    that a quality education is the product of a nurturing staff, involved families, high expectations, and an    atmosphere respectful of individual differences. Parents as partners in education are encouraged to    foster the growth of their children by becoming more involved in our school community.    I.S. 10 encourages children to excel and become lifelong learners. To reach these goals, students will    be engaged in activities that foster critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making through    academic rigor, technology, and the arts.”       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school sits in the midst of Long Island City, Queens, in close proximity to two of our three feeder elementary  schools and William Cullen Bryant High School. Long Island City is a densely populated community, which includes:  small businesses and multiple dwellings, Museums of Art and the Moving Image and industrial buildings. There are a  large number of recently arrived immigrants from the Middle East, Asia, Europe and South America. 53% of our  students are Hispanic, 17% of our students are Caucasian, 22% of our students are Asian, and 7% of our students is  African American. Originally designed and built as an elementary school, and functioning for many years as a Junior  High School, we are presently an intermediate school servicing grades 6, 7 and 8 with a population projection of 768  students. The rear of the school is adjacent to an asphalt park, which is used for recess activities.    I.S. 10Q, proudly continues to have partnerships with the Museum of the Moving Image, Boys and Girls club, The  Brooklyn Grange, the Young Explorers (NYPD), the RAPP program, and the New York Foundling Assoc.    Inside the school, we have a science room with experiment tables and sinks, an Hydroponics science room, a  multimedia library, and a fully equipped auditorium with sound system; although ready to be upgraded it is still  functional. All classrooms have access to the Internet and are equipped with interactive white boards. The school has  wireless capabilities in all student classrooms, and several computer carts assist with projects and research. The  cafeteria facility for students has limited space making it necessary, to have three lunch periods.       Our parent coordinator in unison with the parents of our Parent Association, continue to provide workshops and  other parent activities to increase parent involvement and increase their understanding on areas such as; The  Changing promotional requirements, the Standards, The Adolescent Child, test sophistication, on line bullying, and  social and emotional needs.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The number of students with disabilities and receiving mandated services, is at this time is projected at 152. Students  are mainstreamed into general education classes at the discretion of the IEP team, and self-contained teachers’  recommendations. The criteria for mainstreaming are performance in subject area, individual assessment by the I.E.P.  team to measure behavior, suitability for individual students to perform in a mainstream class with the workload  required and student interest in a particular subject area. There are approximately 11-15 general education students  receiving resource room services. Twenty percent of our students are ENL. Dozens of native languages are  represented in our diverse population. Due to the diverse immigrant population, there are insufficient numbers of  students in most native languages to form bilingual classes. We have created the following ENL classes, one 6 th grade  class, one 7 th grade class, and one 8 th grade class. Each of our 3 ENL classes are taught language arts, ENL, science,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      social studies, and mathematics by permanently certified teachers. All ENLs, receive the mandated\required times of  arts, and physical education.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In cooperation with the administrative and instructional cabinet, and the SLT, by reviewing the data we determined  that, I.S. 10Q made the most progress in the area of ELA. All students at (42.6%) in 2017, with an increase in SWD  from 9.1% in 2016 to a 10.6% in 2017. We are awaiting the ELL data. Rigorous instruction in science and math will  continue to be the focus. We will continue to align the curriculum throughout the grades, in order to move forward  and continue to remain in Good Standing. Further, after reviewing our PPO feedback, improving and aligning  classroom assessment, questioning, and giving meaningful feedback to teachers via the Advance observation system,  will continue to be a focus for the 2018-2019 school year.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 30Q010   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   741   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In analyzing the NYS Proficiency results, Progress results and comparison of City-Wide Schools and Peer Schools data  revealed that Proficiency in ELA was 46.1% and Math was 33.7%, a decline from last year's 35.1% . The school's  strength is in the area of ELA, and the NYC instructional reports were used to obtain more specific information that  assisted teachers in identifying areas of strengths and challenge for students. In ELA, the instructional report analysis  revealed that although students performed (vs the city) well, our ELA dept. needs to focus on literary points of view,  evaluating an argument, and word meaning. In analyzing the data from the instructional reports, we identified our  SWD students with having difficulties with writing to sources, with a high number of negative .47%, while our ELL  students had an increase since last year in all areas, with a high positive .53% in all areas. In order to continue to  improve our teams, we continue to analyze the results from the Quarterly assessments given in house, and it will be  followed by analyzing the New York State results. Consequently, the next step will be to breakdown our item skill  analysis to focus and pinpoint the strands that are in need of improvement from the previous year’s data. For  example, this analysis identifies “Standards of need” using the following factors:    High frequency of questions in which specific standards occur    High frequency of low percentage “correct” question responses as a school (per grade)    High frequency of low values in the difference in percentage of “correct” question responses as a school/grade as  compared to NYC results.    Teachers will continue to modify curriculum maps, pacing calendars, and alter the Expeditionary Learning curriculum  in order to address our SWD and ELLs needs. Data analysis, and identification of strands from the previous year’s  results, will guide the initial team meetings, and the teams will continue to be supported by our Department  chairpersons, and Asst. Principals. This support will continue when necessary by consultants who have conducted past  professional development to our professional learning teams, and Borough Support Center staff.    Also, beginning, the 2018- 2019 school year, all seventh and eight grade teachers will begin to loop with their  students. Grade seven teacher will move up to grade eight with their classes, and grade eight teachers will begin a  new cycle with grade seventh students.    After teacher teams analyze the data, they will create and modify assessments and rubrics that are aligned with the  school’s curriculum. The school uses common assessments to determine student progress toward goals across grades  and subject areas. Across classrooms, teachers’ assessment practices consistently reflect the use of ongoing checks  for understanding and student self-assessment .

By June 2019, 95% of teacher teams will continue to align assessment in the classroom to curricula, and checks for  understanding for all ELLs, SWD, lower one third and upper one third in the classrooms. These alignments will be  monitored every three to four weeks, via the collection of lesson plans, curriculum maps, and/or pacing calendars.  Progress will also be measured via formal and low inference observations, and the analysis of our quarterly assessment  in ELA.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. IS 10, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1. ELL's are evaluated by an informal interview, and administered the NYSITELL, In-house Pre and Post Assessments, and  student work/portfolios.  The data provides a baseline reading and writing level which is then used to determine placement  and additional services for the students.  2. The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results over a three year period reveal that there are a large percentage, 45%,  of three-year  Advanced students that are on the Proficiency borderline.  This pattern helps direct instruction specifically towards this need  as students will reach English Proficiency.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   1.  Asst.

Data is revisited at the end of the scholastic school year.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  I.S. 10, monitors performance through Learning walkthroughs, Formal and Informal observations, snapshots,  State Exams  results, Report Cards, NewsELA pre and post Data, and in-house Periodic assessments, the ELL focus is constantly being  realigned according to students' needs, and skills.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Data is reviewed by the Asst. Principal, Principal, ESL dept. Chair, and reg. Ed. Teachers.   Placement and programs are chosen;  e.g., more ESl minutes, or more AIS programming, and RTI is discussed on a case by case basis.  Data is revisited at the end of the scholastic school year.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The NYSITELL, NYSESLAT over the last three year period, have shown that many of our ELL students that range on the 4-6 years  in the school system are approaching proficiency.  In order to facilitate the transition, we have created after school programs  that are geared toward test sophistication, and our AIS program focuses on writing and comprehension for ELLs via our new  software system, NewsELA      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We are currently awaiting the results from the state in regards to the NYSESLAT, Math, ELA, and Grade eight Science.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Instructional cabinet, chairperson of dept., review the Data, and identify trends.  Asst. Principals, and Dept. Chairs, meet with the teams, and share their findings.  teams dedicate the months of September and October to review, rewrite, and adjust pacing calendars and curriculum maps, to  address our deficiencies.  Parents are informed during our P.A. meetings.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   I.S. 10 has set up a Freestanding ENL program. All of the 133 students in our program will receive the mandated  number of minutes or more in ESL and ELA, accordingly as determined by the NYSITELL and the  NYSESLAT scores.  Regardless of their level, they will receive a minimum of 8 periods per week, 45 minutes per period,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         in ELA.  They will then receive ENL in accordance with their results in the NYSESLAT once the data is received.  Former  ELL students, will receive their mandated two periods of instruction, via an ELA teacher, as a pull out.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              ENL periods are provided in two venues:  1.  4-5 periods of freestanding ENL.  2.  3-4 periods of ENL via push-in model  into a core subject area.  Each period for a duration of 45 minutes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      ELLs are provided with differentiated instruction within their ELA, Math, S.S., Sci., and ENL class which includes grouping  based on specific needs with targeted skills in order to maximize growth.  This methodology is closely followed in our after  school program were the students are grouped according to ability, and not according to their corresponding grade level.  Core  content is delivered via their core classes by the content area teachers, with the future assistance of two ENL teachers..        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are given the opportunity to take the NYC Performance exams, and the NYS eams in their native language, and will take  the assessment if needed in separate location.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a. Sife:  Two of our ELL students have been identified as SIFE students.  These students have been identified through academic  records, grades and test scores,  informal assessment of literacy skills, interview and inquiry into a student’s academic  background and writing samples.  In addition to our After School ELA and Math Program, SIFE students are offered and  encouraged to participate in extended day activities which include academic classes and clubs.  AIS services also provide SIFE  students with additional support to increase literacy and mathematics.  These services are implemented during the school  day.   SIFE students also use the following resources:  Sound Reading, a program that is devised primarily for Beginners ENLs,  to train the students in the beginning stages of the  English phonics and phonemes.  Guidance Counselors are used as an  intervention tool and serve as a connection between home and school.  b.  New comers:  In addition to all the services described under the developing and SIFE description programs, our focus will be  on parent and child outreach and assimilation to community and school culture.    Parents of students who are new to the country need a lot of support from the school community.    Translation Funding can be used to help facilitate this transition.  These services will be used to:  Communicate information about the school’s academic programs and after school programs  Communicate information about a child’s academic progress and student needs  Translating written communications between school and home  Also, our I.S. 10 website, and school APP, that is used primarily for communication with parents, is able to translate all  information to parents in more than 70 different languages with the simple push of a button.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      c.  Developing:   ELLs will continue to receive individualized and differentiated instruction as well as AIS services.  In the  classrooms, lessons will integrate literacy with academic content.  Teachers will draw on students’ cultural and linguistic  backgrounds and life experiences.  Data will be used to drive instruction.  The instruction will be geared toward helping  developing ELLs build literacy skills and strategies. Lessons will be based on the Learning Standards for English as a Second  Language.  Developing  ELLs will use NewsELA, as well as, being invited to participate in extended day activities and the After  School Reading and Math Program.   d.  Long-term; ELLs will continue to receive individualized and differentiated instruction as well as AIS services.  In the  classrooms, lessons will integrate literacy with academic content.  Teachers will draw on students’ cultural and linguistic  backgrounds and life experiences.  Our goal is to move our long term ELLs in accomplishing the goal of English Language  proficiency.  Data will be used to drive instruction.  The instruction will be geared toward helping our long-term ELLs build  literacy skills and strategies. Lessons will be based on the Learning Standards for English, Math, and Science.  Long Term ELLs  will use NewsELA, as well as, being invited to participate in extended day activities and the After School Reading and Math  Program.   e.  Former ELLs: Are placed in Targeted classes to assist them during their transition to Regular classes.  Target classes follow a  modified curriculum that ensures that the pacing of instruction is tailored to address the acquisition of academic language,  while following the infusion of the standards in all core subjects.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Instructional Materials Used:  -Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT  -ESL Accelerator (software)  -NewsELA (software)  ELL-SWD students are also programmed into our Direct Instruction classes, were students are placed according to ability and  not their grade level.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All SWD ELL's receive ELL Services via a push-in method.  An ESL teacher works with the content area teacher within the  classroom followed by a 4 times/week pull out service where the same ESL instructor reinforces the learning that occurred and  uses ESL accelerator, and/or NewsELA to enhance comprehension and vocabulary.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  SWD ELL's, Hold Overs,  and ELLs with Writing Deficiencies:  SWDs:  Pull out program, 4x/wk, 1 pd/session, 45 minutes where students are main streamed into a grade appropriate class in  order to receive the ESL instruction via a licensed ESL techer.  Hold Overs and ELLs with Writing Deficiencies:  Students are held over 1 grade.  Students are placed in an ESL class with extra  AIS services, 4x/wk, 1 pd/session, 45 minutes.  ESL services are provided by a licensed ESL teacher while the AIS services are  delivered by a licensed ELA teacher.  ELLs in need of intervention, will attend our after school program 3x/wk for 5 months.  The materials used in this program are,  ESL Accelerator, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and Kaplan.  Furthermore, our SWD students are scheduled 4x/wk for direct  instruction Phonetic Program.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New program to be used in the ESL classes is called NewsELA, a program that focuses on non-fiction articles, that combines  real time assessment with differentiated content.  All articles are provided in different lexicon levels, and the software  adujustes the difficulty of the reading, assignments, and assessments according to each child level and ability.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      We will continue to use ESL accelerator, a phonetic, visual/Kinesthetic program that allows the students to progress at various  level of instruction.     10.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Clemente Lopes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   I.S. 10Q                                                                              School DBN: 30Q010  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
