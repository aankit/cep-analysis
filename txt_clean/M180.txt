This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our core values are deeply rooted in in a culture of CARE: collaboration, arts & inquiry-based learning, reflection, and  empowerment. As a caring community of innovators and leaders, we strongly believe that        learning is constructed through social interaction and experience;  children develop confidence in their own voice if they have the opportunity to creatively examine new ideas  from multiple perspectives and generate innovative solutions to challenging real-world problems;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            the habitual practice of self and peer reflection, feedback, and monitoring of goals leads to improved teaching  and learning; and     ownership of learning intersects at passion, strengths, and confidence.   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Who We are      Hugo Newman College Preparatory School – PS/ IS 180 is located at 370 West 120th Street in the heart of Harlem. We  know that the education of every child begins at home and is a continued partnership between parents, educators,  and the community. We are poised and prepared to meet the needs of every child that passes through our doors. We  are a collaborative community of students, teachers and parents working together to ensure that that our children  meet their fullest potential.      What Makes us Unique      We believe in offering inclusive high-quality educational experiences for all students. On each grade, we have an  Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) classroom model. Collaboratively, one general education teacher and one special  education teacher work together in the same classroom to support and teach children with and without identified  disabilities. All students benefit from this inclusive level of support.      Also, we offer Dual Language (DL) as an option for families in grades Pre-K through 5th Grade; it is aform of education  in which students are taught literacy and content in two languages. One out of the three classes on each grade is Dual  Language (English/ Spanish). Our DL program started in the 2013-2014 year in Kindergarten. Children have the  opportunity to graduate elementary school as bilingual and biliterate. Students receive instruction in English on  Mondays and Wednesdays, and students receive all core content instruction with full-day Spanish immersion on  Tuesdays and Thursdays with Fridays alternating between the two languages. Both English Language Learners and  native English speakers develop a positive sense of self and increased appreciation of cultures.      PS/IS 180 has long standing community based partnerships that assist us in meeting our goals. With all of our  community partners, we work together to ensure that our students are healthy, academically prepared, active  learners, and fully involved in contributing to their community and larger society. Our students receive on-site full  medical care, at-risk mental health services, vision services, dental care, and play therapy sessions through our  partnerships with the Ryan Health Center, SUNY Optometry, Columbia Dental, and NYU School of Social Work. These  partnerships have helped us to improve attendance and support our families in various areas of need. In addition to  these health services, we focus on the whole child through our arts programming. To promote the academic and  social-emotional development of youth, we partner with a variety of organizations to deliver enriching academic and  recreational programming opportunities available throughout the school day and/or after school:     PK-5th Grade: Roads to Success (after school)    K-8th Grade: Police Athletic League (after school)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10     PK & K: Ballet Hispanico (during the school day)    PK- 2nd Grade: Studio in a School (during the school day)    1st- 8th Grade: Recess Enhancement with Roads to Success & NY Edge (during the school day)    2nd Grade: Asphalt Green Swimming Program (during the school day)    1st- 5th Grade: Chinese language classes through NYC Mandarin (after school)    3rd Grade: Maritime and Aquarium Project (family and teacher activity on the weekend)    3rd & 4th Grade: Chess in Schools (during the school day)    3rd- 8th Grade: Midori & Friends (residency during the school day and instrumental lessons after school)    5th & 8th Grade: Ballroom Basix (during the school day)    6th- 8th Grade: CREW Advisory program through NYC Outward Bound (during the school day)    6th-8th Grade: Architecture residency through Studio in a School (during the school day)    6th-8th Grade: Columbia University STILE program to support Genius Hour (during the school day)    6th -8th Grade: NY Edge (after school)    Additional after-school activities include: Chess, Mock Trial, Debate Team, Flag Football, Basketball,   Cheerleading, Baseball, Track & Field, and much more         Our students are challenged in their math learning through Number Talks to build mental math, math fluency and  mental computation strategies. They also are challenged in solving real life math problems using deep, rich and  rigorous "Exemplar" problems as well as Common Core aligned "Cognitive Guided Instruction" story problem types.  Our students are engaged in rigorous instruction that is relevant and has real world connections. In English Language  Arts (ELA), students experience Lucy Calkins’s Units of Study series for Opinion, Information, and Narrative Writing. At  PS/IS 180, all curriculum across PK-8 is student-centered, responsive, and assessment based.      In middle school, we shift the ownership of discussing areas of celebration and priority areas from teachers to  students at Student Led Conferences. We foster excellence in our students so that they meet their highest potential  and are prepared for the college and career of their choice.       Our teachers and paraprofessionals receive ongoing professional development and on-site consultancy support from  the following outside organizations to strengthen our pedagogical practices:   Southern Cross Consultancy (Mathematics)     Teacher's College Reading & Writing Project (ELA)      Hyrdoponics Lab and sustainability support with NYSunWorks (Elementary Science)    Urban Advantage for scientific inquiry (Middle School Science)    NYC Mastery Collaborative (mastery-based learning support in Grades 6-8)    Computer Science 4 All (Technology)    NSF- funded Systemic Inquiry Learning Project through Columbia University (cross content areas)    Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility & Fordham University (Grades 3 & 4 only)    Responsive Classroom (PK-8 social-emotional learning program)   Our teachers are regularly engaged in professional learning throughout the school year that supports the academic,  and social-emotional needs of all of our students. Every member of our staff is engaged in Professional Learning  Inquiry Cycles that foster improved teaching and student learning. We are a learning community of staff, students and  parents working together to provide the best educational experience and opportunities to our each and every child.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Hugo Newman College Preparatory School is a community united in providing a high-quality educational experience  to all of our students. At PS/IS 180, we are dedicated to serving all students, regardless of abilities. We are  transforming education by creating systems and structures that align to the specific needs of each student while  ensuring all scholars meet the same learning outcomes needed to be ready for college and careers. For 2018-19, our  school-wide Instructional Focus is to provide a personalized learning experience and continuous relationships among  students, where faculty know each student individually and work to address his or her academic and social needs. We  are grounded in the following theory of action: If we provide students and families with data and information towards  goals and if we build choice and flexibility into classroom learning experiences, then students will develop skills and  confidence needed to make informed decisions about their learning, take agency over their learning, progress, goals,  and ultimately engage and achieve ambitious goals.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We offer students with special needs services according to their individual education plan (IEP). Currently, our  services include models of SETSS and ICT. We also offer students counseling, speech therapy, occupational and  physical therapy as well as other services according to their IEP. For counseling services before we recommend an IEP,  we work closely with the Ryan Health Center to provide mental health services to at-risk students, and we also  partner with NYU School of Social Work for interns to use therapeutic play to prevent or resolve psychosocial  challenges. In addition to supporting students with a disability, our speech therapist uses the research-based Sounds  in Motion program with classroom teachers to support early phonemic awareness and articulation stimulation in early  childhood classrooms. We also have an out-of-classroom full-time Intervention Teacher trained in the Wilson Reading  System to provide literacy support in small groups using the Orton-Gillingham model. For students with limited  English proficiency, we have a full-time English as a New Language teacher who provides a combination of push-in  and pull-out services to improve language acquisition. Students receive a wealth of services throughout the school  day when an academic and/or social-emotional need has been identified.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Within the Framework for Great Schools, the key area that we have made the most progress is Strong Family and  Community Ties. We have well-functioning SLT and PTA boards that have experienced growth in parent involvement  and activism. We also have developed new community partnerships that support our students' social and emotional  growth and in a target area of engaging our higher performing students so that they continue to grow academically,  socially and emotionally so that they are prepared to apply, get accepted, and succeed in competitive high schools.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M180   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   545   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Data Analysis demonstrating Strengths:       Since 2015, we have seen a 1.6% increase in student achievement in Grades 3-8 ELA performance. We  attribute this positive movement to our renewed work with Teachers College Reading and Writing project.     Also, we have seen a 1% increase in student achievement in Grades 3-8 mathematics performance. We   attribute this growth with our implementation of Number Talks school wide and in-depth coaching supporting  with Southern Cross Consultancy.   o   In the 2017-18 school year, our K-5 classrooms experienced TERC Investigations units of study.    Data Analysis demonstrating Priority Needs:     According to 2017-18 Advance MOTP data from teaching observations, 75.8% of teachers were rated Effective   in the Danielson component 3C Engaging Students in Learning. This highlights an area of growth within our  pedagogical practices to ensure there are multiple opportunities for flexible groupings where students are  grouped according to the instructional purpose and students are provided choice with learning tasks.     NYC School Survey results revealed that Rigorous Instruction was rated two points lower (1.6) than the   citywide average (3.6).      78% of students positively responded that "they are learning a lot in their classes at their school to prepare   them for the next level or grade" compared to a 91% citywide average.      62% of students positively responded that "they work in small groups" compared to a 67% citywide average.     79% of teachers positively responded that "students feel challenged" compared to an 84% citywide average.     According to the 2017-18 Quality Review report, the reviewer stated, "Across classrooms, multiple entry   points into the curricula were inconsistently provided to students. Work products and discussions  inconsistently demonstrated high levels of student participation." PS/IS 180 was rated Developing in the area  1.2 Pedagogy on the Quality Review Rubric.   In 2017-18, 70% of students in Grades K-5 were reading at or above grade level, and 76% of students in  Grades 6-8 were reading at or above grade level by June 2018.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Data Analysis demonstrating Strengths:     According to the 2017-18 Quality Review report, PS/IS 180 was rated Proficient in School Culture (1.4 Positive   Learning Environment and 3.4 High Expectations).      According to the 2017-18 ECERS-R report for effectiveness of Pre-K programming, PS/IS 180 received an   overall component 6.4 out of 7 in positive student Interactions, compared to a 5.2 citywide average.  Specifically, in the subareas of General Supervision of Children, Discipline, and Staff-Child Interactions we  received a perfect score of 7 out of 7.     We analyzed the location and time of day of incidents and discovered that less structured times of day like   lunch/ recess previously accounted for a large number of incidents. Therefore, with the generous support of  the PTA, we were able to provide a well-structured recess program with coaches from Asphalt Green and  Roads to Success for Grades 1-8 lunch.    Data Analysis demonstrating Priority Needs:     Review of the school survey revealed that in the area of Supportive Environment there was only 60% positive   responses in this category.   Further review of the NYC School survey revealed that only:      o  66% of teachers responded that "a lot or all of the adults at their school recognize disruptive behavior   as social-emotional learning opportunities" compared to a 75% citywide average.   o  44% of students responded that "in most or all of their classes, their teachers support them when   they are upset" compared to a 56% citywide average.    o  43% of teacher responded that "adults at their school have access to school-based supports to assist   in behavioral and emotional escalations," compared to a 75% citywide average.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, all Grades PK-8 teachers will implement social-emotional learning curriculum, assemblies, and routines,  such as Responsive Classroom's Morning Meeting/ Closing Circle (Gr. PK-5) and Outward Bound CREW (Gr. 6-8), that  will result in a 5% increase in positive responses on the 2018-19 School Survey Supportive Environment Category.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Hugo Newman College Preparatory is a collaborative learning community that promotes and supports the learning of  all members of the school, including students, teachers, parents, and community leaders.    Data Analysis demonstrating Strengths:     The 2017-18 Quality Review cited, "the majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based   professional collaborations. Teachers self-select into different leadership roles and committees." The impact  of this work is that "teachers’ collaborations promote the instructional shifts such as academic language and  have strengthened their instructional capacity. Teachers have a voice in key decisions that affect student  learning across the school."  In the area of 4.2 Teacher Teams & Leadership Development on the Quality Review rubric, PS/IS 180 was  rated Proficient in 2017-18.      Data Analysis demonstrating Priority Needs:     There has been a steady decline in teacher satisfaction with collaborative opportunities. From 2015 to 2017,   the survey element score has dropped from 3.29 (2016) to 2.99 (2017), and then most recently to 1.55 (2018).     The NYC School Survey revealed that "Teacher Innovation and Teacher Responsibility" satisfaction rating was   9% lower than the citywide average.   Further review of the NYC School survey revealed that only:      71% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that "they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their  school on professional development," compared to an 85% citywide average.   24% of teachers said that they have influence over the selection of instructional materials used in classrooms   49% of teachers said that they have influence over standards for student behavior.

Data Analysis demonstrating Strengths:     All teachers received Advance Overall ratings of Highly Effective or Effective in 2016-17 school year; therefore,      no teachers received a Teacher Improvement Plan in 2017-18.  In the 2017-18 Quality Review Report, our area of celebration identified by the reviewer was 3.4 High  Expectations. The report cited, "School leaders consistently convey high expectations to staff through weekly  memos, ongoing feedback and professional learning aligned to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Using  various online platforms, the school provides ongoing information to families regarding student progress  toward college and career readiness." The impact to date was cited as "ongoing communication and support  by school leaders around classroom visits support teachers’ understanding and awareness of expectations for  teaching and learning. Communication from school leaders and teachers help families understand student  progress toward expectations."      Data Analysis demonstrating Priority Needs:     According to the NYC School Survey, 56% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that "the principal makes   clear to the his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals," compared to an 89% citywide average.     54% of teachers say that "the principal encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and   teacher leaders," compared to an 89% citywide average.     68% of teachers reported that "the principal sets high standards for students learning," compared to a 93%   citywide average.     Previous teacher leadership opportunities only included Grade Level Chair. For the 2018-19 school year, we  have added additional teacher leadership opportunities to include Instructional Coaches, Committee Chairs,  as well as Grade Level Chairs.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Data Analysis demonstrating Strengths:         In the 2015-16 Quality Review report it was noted that PS/IS 180 has many partnerships that ensure that  students are receiving supports that address the social, emotional, physical and academic needs of students  in order to meet the goals set in the beginning of the year. Students receive immunization shots and health  care services that have resulted in improved attendance and health of our students. Students receive  optometry services that target students in need of eyeglasses to address any inhibitors to students academic  success. Dental services are also provided to students on-site which helps reduce loss of work time for  parents. These services have helped us support our parents in maintaining our students health and well- being.   In the 2017-18 Quality Review report, PS/IS 180 was rated Proficient in all seven areas within School Culture &  Structure for Improvement.     According to the NYC School Survey, "91% of families say that school staff work hard to build trusting   relationships with families" and "96% of families say that teachers and families think of each other as partners  in educating children."      Data Analysis demonstrating Priority Needs:     On the 2015-16 parent survey participation increased from 10% to 47% of parents participation in the NYC   School Survey. The increased participation of parents provides a measurable parent view on academic,  student programs, parent outreach and initiatives. High survey participation allows us to make improvements  to programs and services. In the 2016-17 school year, we did not meet the goal of a 5% increase; we actually  experienced a decline by 4% with only 43% participation rate. With that said, for the upcoming year our team;  SLT and PTA will coordinate efforts to increase parent participation to 50% in the 2018-19 school year.     According to the NYC School Survey, 86% of parents report that "they feel well-informed by the   communications they receive from their school," compared to a 93% citywide average.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, there will be an increase in parent participation at events resulting in a 10% increase in student  achievement for students performing in the lowest third as measured by Fountas & Pinnell running record data.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

All plans for pre-school student transitions are implemented in coordination with the Office of Early Childhood and  the District Director of Pre-kindergarten Programs. We conduct tours for pre-kindergarten parents who are interested  in their child attending kindergarten. Pre-kindergarten teachers meet with kindergarten teachers to plan for student  transition to kindergarten; this transition includes classrooms visitations, sharing of progress reports and establishing  class list and student portfolio items. Kindergarten teachers prepare a presentation “getting ready for Kindergarten”  in June at the PK moving up ceremony. Additionally, kindergarten teachers conduct a parent presentation for the  parents of first graders. In June, the PK social worker hosts a series of workshops for PK parents on transitioning to  Kindergarten.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure consistent involvement of  parents and the community in our school.   Parent and Family Engagement Policy     To ensure that Hugo Newman College Preparatory School P.S./I.S. 180's Title 1 students have actively involved   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   and engaged parents we:     Distribute a Parent Guide at the beginning of each school year, this guide explains how parents can be   involved through PTA, SLT, and other events and workshops throughout the school year     Provide orientation to new program and workshops in accessing curriculum, programs, technology to support   their children in learning     Provide parents of students with IEP's a guide to provide you with information about rights, procedures and      information on how to support your child with disabilities.

Parents are encouraged to comment, suggest and share ideas  with the SLT and PTA for shared decision making with staff and the administration.     Provide information and notices in their language and have translation available at meetings and workshops.    Provide professional development workshops and other personal and career advancement opportunities.         Parental Involvement and School Quality   P.S./I.S. 180 Parent Involvement Policy was created after careful assessment in meetings, surveys and one-on-one  conversations with parents/guardians including those of ENL and students with disabilities. There will be an annual  evaluation and assessment of the needs, content and effectiveness of this Parent Involvement Policy with Title 1  Parents to augment parent engagement and the academic quality. All evaluations and assessments will be stored by  school administration and used for the sole purpose to outreach, plan workshops and provide educational materials  that meet the needs of parents and students in the Title 1 program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      To increase and improve parent and school quality, our school will:      Involve parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the Title 1 Program as outlined in the  Comprehensive Educational Plan.     Encourage parents to support school level committees and be members of the School Leadership Team, Title   1 Parent Committee and the Parent Teacher Association.     Conduct dual language and ELL parent workshops for Title 1 and Title III parents in the school's ENL and Dual   Language Program.     Conduct the student-parent academic "SPEAR" (Students & Parents Engaging in Academic Readiness)   workshops which include the following initiatives:   1.

H      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   This Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) is developed to ensure the following goals to increase parent engagement at the  Hugo Newman College Preparatory School are achieved. Parent involvement has proved through research to have a  positive effective on student's academic progress and achievement. Students who have parent who regularly  participate and support their learning outperform those whose parents are not as involved. Students of actively  engaged parents adapt easier and are better prepared for tests and other academic challenges. Students achieve  more when parents expect more. We are a community of learners and this includes teachers, students and parents,  we work together to for the benefit of our children. We expect that our PIP will increase social consciousness and the  responsibility that will foster an eagerness in our parents to support academic excellence and work with all members  of our school community to help our children meet their highest potential.   Hugo Newman College Preparatory School PS/IS 180 will further encourage school level parental involvement by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47     Conducting educational family events/activities throughout the year.    Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Team, PTA, and the Title I Committee.    Work collaborative with teacher led committees: PBIS, Literacy & STEM Committee in planning, organizing   outreach for attendance in parent workshops planned by teachers.     Maintain the Parent Coordinator to liaise between the school and families and provide parent workshops,   outreach based on the assessed needs of our students’ parents.

According to the 2018 NYSESLAT scores (NYSITELL for Kindergarten students  and those arriving after the NYSESLAT administration) these students fall at the following  language levels: 3 are Entering, 5 are Emerging, 9 are Transitioning, and 19 are Expanding.      After reviewing the most recent NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores, we have determined that  Reading and Writing are the two modalities, which ELL students in our school need to improve  in order to achieve English Language Proficiency.  Following our school's current focus on  expanding student knowledge in Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering (STEM),  our after-school program will center around improving reading and writing skills through  engaging STEM lessons.  The curriculum will incorporate Science and Mathematics with high- interest, complex texts and writing assignments to analyze and inform.  Minimal home language  support in Spanish will be provided by the instructors.  Support in other languages will be  available through google translate.    Students will be grouped into grades K, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8.  Each group will have no more  than 10 students per group.  Small Groups will be scheduled after-school on Thursdays and  Fridays 2:20-4:00. Classes will be conducted in English.   Groups will meet from November 3rd  to February 17th for a total of 15 Weeks.  Classes will be team taught by our ELL teacher and 2  classroom teachers (also ENL certified). Since our ELL population is spread out across so many  grade levels, all 3 teachers will share a classroom, breaking into small groups when needed to  meet the needs of students at all grade levels.  We will have the option of breaking into separate  classrooms when necessary as well.     For the first 12 weeks of the program lessons will follow an inquiry-based model with a different  STEM topic every 2 weeks.  For example, weeks 1-2 will focus on Electromagnatism, weeks 3-4  will focus on Exploring projectile motion and so on.  Lesson topics will be modified and  differentiated to meet the needs of students at all grade levels.  During weeks 13-15, students will  use what they have learned during the first 12 weeks to to design and conduct a culminating  science experiment to be entered in the school's Science fair in May of 2017.  All lesson plans  will be adapted from www.stem4teachers.org at no cost to the Title III program.  Any materials  needed for the inquiry lessons and  science projects will be purchased using Title III funds at a  cost of no more than $400.  In addition we will purchase 5 chromebooks for students to use  during the Title III after school program for a total of $2000. Students will use the chromebooks  to conduct internet research, access various STEM learning sites, journal writing, and electronic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   book reading.

In addition to ENL services, our school is  currently growing a Dual Language Spanish/English program to serve Spanish speaking  ELLs.  We have been adding one grade level since 2012 and currently have students in grades K- 3.  As we are pioneering this program, we want to make sure that teachers are applying the best  teaching practices in the Dual Language classroom, in order to ensure success for ELLs.  In  addition, MOSL records indicate that many Dual Language students are not reaching grade level  benchmarks in reading.     To address this need, we have created a study group with our ELL coordinator as well as the 4  Dual Language classroom teachers and all Title III after-school teachers.  Our ELL coordinator,  will facilitate this group and teachers will work together through text-based discussion and  inquiry to design best practices.  We will meet every other Wednesday from 2:30-4:00 for a total  of 10 weeks from October 26th-March 15th.     Teachers will read excerpts from "Teaching for Biliteracy" by Kareen Bean and Cheryl Urow.  A  copy of this book for each of the 5 teachers in the group will be purchased using Title III  funds.  Through these professional readings the teachers in the study group hope to better serve  our ELLs and former ELLS by focusing on instruction in both the home language and  English.  Teachers will be given the opportunity to collaborate and apply these strategies to the  current units and lesson plans.

Our ELL Coordinator will hold a workshop on November 3rd  with support from our Middle School Guidance Counselor to help parents of ELLs navigate the  High School application process.  It is important for ELL parents to receive this information in  their native language so that they are aware of all of the High School options available for their  children, including those specializing in ELL services. Necessary translators will be hired  through the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.  On March 7th we will hold a  workshop on ELL accomodations and peparation for  State Assessments (including NYS  assessments and NYSESLAT).   ELL parents must be aware of the importance of these tests and  how to help their children achieve the best results.  On May 23rd we will hold a workshop on  Goal Setting for the summer as well as possible ESL programs in NYC to help maintain literacy  skills over the summer.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our Dual Language program uses Estrellitas to assess Spanish literacy Skills.  In English, all ELLs are assesed using Fountas and  Pinnell (Phonemic Awareness, DRA (Reading Level), and TCRWP (Writing).  This data is shared with all service providers to  identify the strengths and weaknesses of our ELLs.  We have found that, with collaboration between classroom teachers and  Integrated providers, we can target specific skills to be worked-on during one-on-one and small group work.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Student progress is measured periodically through the DRA.  The expectation is one year's growth as measured by running  records.  For ELLs annual progress is measured through the NYSESLAT.   In Math, students take pre and post assessment tests  for each unit and take a periodic diagnostic assessment through i-Ready.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students are instructed in reading and writing at their level through guided reading in small group and one on one  conferences.   Reading and writing intervention is carried-out through instruction in the Wilson program in small  groups.  Students are also able to access and read books online through Raz-kids.com (lower grades) and MyOn (upper  grades).  In math, students are instructed at their level through small group and one on one lessons including leveled Math  games every Friday.  In addition, students and teachers are given access to i-Ready, which delivers online lessons at their  individual level and gives teachers tools for best-practice, Common Core lessons.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For all ELLs who score below the specified performance levels on the NYSESLAT, our school determines additional support  services to provide.  These services are aligned to any intervention plans provided to all students.  We provide additional  support in Math.  All teachers are receiving professional development to include Math games, manipulatives, and other ELL  teaching strategies.  Small group instruction rotations are conducted throughout the week.  We also conduct level 1 group  interventions once per week.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Most students improve on a continuum from year to year as indicated by scores on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Speaking and  Listening are the first modalities in which students excel, followed by Reading, and finally Writing.  Students who enter the  school in the Early Childhood years (Pre-K - 2  nd)   Grade) have the most success in progressing quickly through language  acquisition levels.  Standardized test data from 2014-15 reveals that ELLs are progressing at an appropriate rate in ELA and  Math, however former ELLs, may need additional support in Math.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELLs are grouped together in one class at each grade level and travel together as a group.  Stand-alone study is  conducted by the ENL teacher in a separate classroom.  Integrated study is conducted by the ENL teacher and  classroom teacher in the grade level classroom.  ENL instruction for entering students is comprised of 180 minutes of  stand-alone study and 180 minutes of integrated study in the ELA classroom.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes a  week of stand-alone ENL and 270 minutes of integrated study in the ELA classroom.  Transitioning and Expanding  students are instructed for 180 minutes per week in the ELA classroom.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes  per week of integrated ENL in the ELA classroom.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         b.

We have added one DL class per grade level, beginning with  Kindergarten each year.  Currently there is one Dual Language class per grade level in Kindergarten- 3rd  Grade.  Students remain with the same classroom teacher for the year and instruction is divided into 50% English  and %50 Spanish every day.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Stand-Alone ENL is delivered by a K-12 certified ESOL teacher.  Integrated ELA and Content Area instruction is delivered  by an ESOL teacher and an ELA or Content Area teacher in tandem.  ENL instruction for entering students is comprised of 180  minutes of stand-alone study and 180 minutes of integrated study in the ELA classroom.  Emerging students receive 90  minutes a week of stand-alone ENL and 270 minutes of integrated study in the ELA classroom.  Transitioning and Expanding  students are instructed for 180 minutes per week in the ELA classroom.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes per week of  integrated ENL in the ELA classroom.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Content is delivered in the ENL classroom through the following programs: Go Math (K-5) and Connected Math (6-8), Social  Studies (Houghton Mifflin (K-5) and MacDougal Littell (6-8)), Science (Foss).  Our dual language program uses Spanish versions  of he same programs.  Language development is fostered according to the principles established in the World-Class  Instructional Design and Assessment (WIDA) framework as well as the QTEL (Quality Teaching of English Learners (QTEL)  approach.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are formally assessed in Spanish using Maravillas, Go Math, and DRA Spanish monthly.  Informal assessments are  teacher created and ongoing.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  Once a student is identified as a SIFE, they are supported through home language instruction, explicit instruction in literacy  skills, and scaffolded support from an ENL instructor.  If native language instruction is not available, a SIFE is supported  through scaffolded instruction and technological support.  b. Newcomer students are supported to home language instruction, which is gradually phased-out as well as scaffolded  instruction from an ENL instructor.  If native language instruction is not available, a newcomer is supported through scaffolded  instruction and technological support.  c. Developing ELLs are supported throuch scaffolded instruction including the front-loading of vocabulary in an integrated  classroom environment.  d.  Long Term ELLs are supported through scaffolded instruction and are also targeted to take-part in our school's Title III after- school program for extra support.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Teachers of ELL-SWDs use the Wilson Phonics program, Words Their Way for ELLs, as well as principles and strategies  presented in WIDA and QTEL.  These programs and strategies scaffold instruction, providing access to academic content and  accellerating English language development.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are enabled to achieve their IEP goals through integrated instruction either in a co-teaching model or through SETTS  push-in.  All ELL-SWDs also receive the appropriate ENL services according to their language level.  When possible, all services  are provided through an integrated model.  ELL-SWDs are placed in inclusive classrooms to maximize time spent with non- disabled peers.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELL students who are determined to be at risk in ELA, Math or other core content areas are targeted through our Title III after- school program.  Any student who is a long-term ELL, whose language level is Entering or Emergent, or who has not shown  adequate progress on the NYSESLAT from the previous school year is targeted for this program.  When possible, instruction is  given in the native language.  During the school day, ELL students at risk in ELA or Math are given daily targeted, small-group  instruction and work in weekly intervention groups.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year we plan to add a 5thGrade Dual Language class.  Our ENL teacher will take part in professional  development cohort meetings with other ENL teachers from the districts.  Our Dual Language teachers will continue to receive  professional development from Maravillas.  We will use a portion of our Title III funds to purchase literacy materials specifically  designed for ELLs.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs in 3  rd  -8  th   Grade are eligible to participate in our school's Sports and Arts Foundation after school program.  At risk  ELLs will participate in our Title III after school program. Notices for both programs are sent home in the parents' preferred  language.  Sports and Arts activities provide equal opportunity for participation by being non-language dominant  activities.  The Title III program is structured for one-on-one or small group support from our ENL teacher.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All of our classrooms are equipped with a Smartboard, allowing teachers to provide visuals and engaging activities for  ELLs.  ELL students can access literacy materials online through Raz-Kids.  Grade level teams have built ELL supports into their  content area curriculum maps.  Newcomer ELLs are given access to Duolingo, an online language learning tool.  Math, Social  Studies, and Science materials are utilized in Spanish for all native Spanish speaking ELLs.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Dual Language program home language support is delivered through %50 instruction in English and %50 in Spanish.  In  the ENL program Spanish support is delivered by our bilingual teacher.  Other languages are supported utilizing dictionaries  and online resources.  The following materials are utilized in both English and Spanish: Go Math and Connected Math,  Harcourt Mifflin and McDougal Littell (Social Studies) and Foss (Science).        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    When creating curriculum maps, grade level teams build-in ELL supports and resources.  Our ENL teacher meets regularly with  classroom teachers to plan lessons that support ELLs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All of our classrooms are equipped with a Smartboard, allowing teachers to provide visuals and engaging activities for  ELLs.  ELL students can access literacy materials online through Raz-Kids.  Grade level teams have built ELL supports into their  content area curriculum maps.  Newcomer ELLs are given access to Duolingo, an online language learning tool.  Math, Social  Studies, and Science materials are utilized in Spanish for all native Spanish speaking ELLs.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We recommend summer programs for ELLs such as PAL, and the Fordham Summer Reading Program.  Newly enrolled ELLs are  assigned a classroom buddy who speaks their home language.  School counselors are available to assist with the assimilation  process.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a. Our dual language model is self-contained.  EPs and ELLs are mixed heterogeneously by grade  level.  %50 of daily instruction is in English and %50 in Spanish.  b.  Core content areas are taught switching languages weekly (the roller-coaster model).  For example,  weeks 1, 3, 5, etc of Science are taught in English and weeks 2, 4, 6, etc. are taught in Spanish.  c.  Each language is separated using color-coding and separate areas of the room.  English words are  written in blue and Spanish in red.  d. Both languages are taught simultaneously in emergent literacy.  English proficient students are  assessed in Spanish through the DRA (Spanish version).         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL teacher will take part in professional development cohort meetings with other ENL teachers from the district.  She will  meet regularly with classroom teachers of ELLs during Monday's bult-in professional development time after school.    Our  Dual Language teachers will continue to receive professional development from Maravillas.  Dual language teachers will also  meet regularly for cross-grade ELL planning.  All staff will be provided with professional development outlining ways to provide  ELLs with equal access to academic content.  Our ENL will lead meetings in December and March.     ENL and Dual Language teachers are offered professional development including sessions offfered through the NYC  department of education as well as in school sessions offered by our ENL teacher covering how to address language  progression, demands, scaffolds, and supports.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ELL students transitioning from our elementary to middle school continue using the same facilities and are serviced by the  same ENL teacher.  ELL students wishing to transfer to another middle school are given recommendations of schools with  services to meet their needs. Guidance counselors are given professional development in order to assist ELLs as they  transition.     In accordance with CR Part 154.2, %15 percent of all teacher professional development and %50 of dual language/ENL teacher  development is geared to language acquisition.  This includes a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  Attendance is taken at all meetings and agendas  are filed in teachers' files.  These sessions will take place on Mondays from 2:20-3:35.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs are scheduled during built-in Tuesday professional development time (2:20- 3:35).  During this time teachers of ELLs and parents discuss the goals of the program, language development progress,  language proficiency assessment results and language development needs.  Spanish and French speaking staff are available for  translation.  Other languages require interpretation from the NYCDOE translation unit.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Dual language parent meetings are held 3 times a year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lana Fleming, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Hugo Newman College Prep 180M                                                                              School DBN: 03M180  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
