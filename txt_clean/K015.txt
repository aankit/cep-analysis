This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Nestled in the heart of Red Hook, The Patrick F. Daly Magnet School of the Arts is a small community school with a  strong arts focused curriculum serving students in grades PreK-5.    We are a diverse, nurturing and vibrant community that provides a standards-based comprehensive educational  program which includes an arts-centered approach for all of our students with a focus on Science, Technology,  Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM). We are home to two unique programs: a Spanish dual language program and  an inclusive program for students with intellectual disabilities (ACES). Active learning is at the heart of our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      instruction. Our teachers are active learners, too. They participate in professional development and inquiry groups  to continually improve their craft .    We take a holistic approach to education that nurtures the child by offering a safe and stimulating education for all  our students; we strive to seamlessly integrate all members of our diverse student body, including students with  Disabilities (SWDs) and English Language Learners (ELL). We promote wellness through numerous on-site services  and community partners. Our wrap-around services include, on-site occupational, physical and speech therapists.  NYU Langone provides medical, mental health and dental services.    PS 15 thrives on active partnerships with many community organizations including: Studio-in-a-School, Extreme  Kids and Crew, Young Audiences of NY, Brooklyn Youth Chorus, Creative Arts Team, Kentler Gallery, Inside  Broadway, Marquis Studios and Cafeteria Culture among others.   We encourage strong parent participation as well as a collaborative and professional partnership with community- based organizations that address the physical, intellectual, emotional, moral and social needs of our children. our  teachers participate in professional development to offer continuous improvement and ongoing staff development.  Our instructional programs enable all children to reach high levels of performance that will prepare them to be  successful people in the 21st Century.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 15 is located in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn that continues to change in order to fit the needs of its diverse  populations. The neighborhood is a mixture of light industry and small businesses which now are owned by many  local residents. However, according to student enrollment, 86% of the school population lives in public housing. In an  effort to mirror the demographics of the community and increase capacity, P.S. 15 was awarded a Magnet Grant that  infuses STEM components with the arts. P.S.15 has high standards and expectations and a challenging and rigorous  curriculum that incorporates the arts and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) experiences. We  encourage strong parent participation and have a wealth of partnerships with arts and community-based  organizations to address the intellectual, creative, physical, emotional, and social needs of all of our children. NYU  Medical Center offers school-based clinic services, as well as dental and a mental health component to students and  parents. Academic support is available through the many arts-based activities offered after school, and curriculum- based clubs support our advanced learners. Saturday Academy and after school intervention clubs provide small  group targeted instruction in ELA and Math.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S 15 offers a full continuum of special education services and houses three Academic, Career, and Essential Skills  programs (ACES) for grades PreK-5. In addition, English as a New Language (ENL) is offered to all eligible students and  Spanish Dual Language classes are currently available in grades PreK-5. In recognizing the importance of early  childhood education, we now offer five full-day pre-kindergartens; one of which is a Super Start PreK.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past year, P.S. 15 has shown great progress in forming strong family-community ties. The Friends of P.S. 15  Committee has made outreach to many families and businesses throughout the Red Hook Community. As a result, a  stronger school-community bond has been established. Local artists and entrepreneurs are currently supporting  classroom instruction by providing additional real-life experiences for our students. New alliances have been created  to sustain the progress that has been made thus far. As part of our school’s STEM focus, P.S. 15 has incorporated a  STEM expo which allows for children to create and exhibit scientific inventions and experiments. A newly formed  partnership with Pioneer Works has exposed students to the integration of visual arts and technology. P.S. 15 is a  Beacon School and offers after school and weekend programs through the Community Based Organization, Good   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Shepherd Services.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35         representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 15 The Patrick F Daly Magnet School of the Arts in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 15, The Patrick F. Daly Magnet School of the Art will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  systems, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 31st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I and other applicable sections in the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment system to assess the early literacy and reading skills of all of  our students, including our ELL students. These assessments measure not only reading accuracy and comprehension but  foundational skills as well, including:  recognizing rhyme, initial sound recognition, blending and segmenting phonemes,  spelling patterns, and sight word recognition.  Benchmark assessments that are included in the Wilson Fundations program also provide assessment results to our teachers  so they may monitor progress of early literacy skills. This year we will add TC Writing Pathways to assess our students’ writing  skills. This approach includes on-demand writing prompts, learning progressions, student checklists and rubrics that support  school-wide performance assessment and will naturally support how we guide instruction for our ELLs. All teachers in Grades  K-5 use assessments that coordinate with Go Math to support instructional planning for our ELLs in mathematics.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44           In our Dual Language kindergarten class, our K and Grade 1 teachers uses the Spanish version of the Fountas and Pinnell  Benchmark assessment in addition to the benchmark assessments included in the Estrellita program. In our Grades 2-4 Dual  Language classes the teachers use EDL2 ( Evaluación del Desarrollo de la Lectura 2) to assess literacy in both Spanish and  English.  ELLs who take the NYSAA exam in place of state tests participate in an assessment called Sandi-FAST (Student Annual Needs  Determination Inventory and Formative Assessment of Standards Tasks). This program provides both summative and  formative assessment results that support strategic planning for these ELL students.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers are provided with the necessary materials to conduct these assessments. In addition, teachers meet in grade-level  groups that include the classroom teachers of ELLs to review assessment results to determine students’ academic needs. Our  literacy coach, ESL teacher, and other professionals (through district PD or hired by the school) provide support to classroom  teachers in regards to administering these assessments, analyzing results and providing targeted instruction to ELL students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At the start of the year, the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment is used, as its results do provide baseline data (it is  formulated to provide both formative and summative assessment results) in reading and early literacy skills for each child and  the results allow teachers to determine specific areas of need for all students, including ELLs in Grades K-5. There are yearly  benchmarks included in the guide that indicate where students should be at different points in the school year.    State Test Results for ELA and math and teacher-made end-of-unit assessments are other assessments that can be used to  measure progress and highlight areas of need.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data has been gathered, results are reviewed by teachers in grade-level PLC groups to determine Tier 1 intervention  delivered by the classroom teacher. This data is also shared with the intervention team for review as well, to determine  students who may need Tier 2 RTI services. Students are then served in small groups based on their academic needs by the  reading coach, ESL teacher and/or the IEP/Intervention teacher.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Like all schools, P.S. 15 follows the three-tiered model for Response to Intervention (RTI).  Teachers are given a form to use to  keep track of any Tier 1 services they provide to their students.  Attached to the RTI form is a list of behaviors ELL students  may exhibit that are similar to, but should not be confused with, those of a student with a learning disability. This is to make  teachers aware of the specific needs an ELL child has in regards to their academic experience. Tier 1 instruction includes high  quality, research-based whole class instruction, delivered by the classroom and ESL teacher, and is geared to meet the needs  of 80% of the students in the class, with differentiated lessons delivered through small group work.   Teacher observation and  screeners may indicate students need additional support, and the classroom teacher and ESL teacher will work together to  look at data from the screeners and other assessments to put a plan in place that may include a 9 week cycle of Tier 2 support  with regular progress monitoring.  In addition, the ESL teacher, literacy coach, special education liaison or assistant principal  will provide a professional development session about RTI to all school staff.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data from the NYSESLAT directly informs our ESL instruction here at P.S. 15. Test results are examined to identify the areas of  weakness for each student, and to look for patterns of weakness, so the instruction can be enriched to directly support areas  of concern, specifically listening, speaking, reading or writing. Also examined is a students years of service, where we look at  how long each student remains in the ELL program. We are mindful that research shows that it does take, at the very least,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         seven years to master a new language, but we do look for trends and patterns in students’ years of service to make sure they  are getting necessary support to gain English proficiency.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Weekly academic cabinet meetings with the principal, assistant principal and other staff members provide a forum to share  these findings and make decisions about how best to serve our ELL students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our ENL program is delivered by a certified ENL teacher, who also holds a license to teach Grades PK-6. Therefore, she  delivers both stand-alone and Integrated ENL instruction to Ell students.  She follows two models of delivery:  Push-in and Pull-out.  For the Pull-out model, students are groups in adjacent grade bands (depending on the number of ELLs in each grade)  but with mixed proficiency levels where she many plan lessons that support English language development or the  content areas, depending on which session is happening that day. Each session is planned to mean the required  minutes of instruction (stand-alone or integrated) that each student’s language proficiency level demands. There are  times when students (newcomers and/or students at the lowest proficiency levels) are grouped homogeneously in  order to get targeted ENL stand-alone instruction to help them get the maximum amount of support beginners need  to find success.    For the Push-in model, our ENL teacher plans with the classroom teacher, science teacher and library teacher to serve  ELLs with their class.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:    We do not have a TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Students in our Dual Language program who are ELLs receive ENL services from their classroom teachers. These  teachers use the students’ proficiency levels and guidelines provided in CR Part 154 to ensure they deliver the proper  amount of ENL instruction to their ELL students. Students of mixed proficiency levels are in the dual  language classrooms. The teacher's literacy instruction is based on student assessment results in both languages.  In most areas of instruction, (morning meeting, shared reading, read aloud, reading and writing workshop, science,  social studies, mathematics) the LOI will alternate with the roller coaster model.  However, for word study (print  knowledge, alphabet awareness, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness) our dual language teachers choose  from two options.  After assessing their ELL and EP students, teachers plan for word study based on one of the two  choices below.  Teachers may employ the use of sequential language instruction. For example, in kindergarten, English dominant  students can be grouped to participate in the Fundations program and Spanish dominant students can be grouped to  participate in the Estrellitas program.   Another option is simultaneous language instruction, where students learn the early literacy skills of both languages  at the same time. Care is taken if this option is chosen, as it is difficult to complete two early literacy programs in one  school year.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           CR Part 154 provides a table with explicit guidelines on programming ELL’s instructional minutes. These guidelines are  used when those teachers delivering ENL services are scheduling their programs. Once schedules are made they are shared  with and reviewed by the principal and assistant principal.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All instruction in core content delivered in our Dual Language classrooms and by our ENL teacher emphasize a balanced  approach to further a student’s English language proficiency while developing specific knowledge in the areas of science, art,  math and social studies, while rooted by the Common Core Standards. Through shared and close reading of sophisticated texts  combined with hands-on activities and supports centered around academic vocabulary development our ESL and Dual  Language teachers help students build the necessary schema they need to understand content area lessons and concepts.  Realia, videos, photographs, time lines, historical documents, graphic organizers, differentiated assignments, computer  software and anchor charts provide strong supports within the classroom for students to use during lessons, group and  independent work.  In the dual language classroom, Spanish-speaking ELLs benefit from instruction in their native language in all content areas  throughout the school year.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     In our Dual Language kindergarten class, our K and Grade 1 teachers uses the Spanish version of the Fountas and Pinnell  Benchmark assessment in addition to the benchmark assessments included in the Estrellita program. In our Grades 2-5 Dual  Language classes the teachers use EDL2 ( Evaluación del Desarrollo de la Lectura 2) to assess Spanish literacy skills. We are  currently exploring the use of the new Spanish HLA assessments for the 2018-19 school year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiation of instruction for our ELLs is a priority.  ELLs identified as SIFE are offered additional support in their native  language through the use of our multilingual paraprofessional staff.  Our instructional plan also includes providing support for  these students and our Newcomers (those with less than 3 years of schooling in the US) in a number of ways.  In their  classrooms, they are paired with students who speak their native language, and if available, classroom teachers or support  staff who speak their native language. To support daily instruction, the ESL teacher provides professional development to  classroom and cluster teachers on ESL methodologies. For students receiving service over 3 years, also known as the subgroup  of Developing, additional instruction in vocabulary development and thematic lessons that provide practice in research and  discussion take place with the ENL teacher. Additional support in reading instruction and test-taking strategies are offered by  our highly qualified literacy coach.  Specifically targeted professional development is also provided to the teachers of these  students.  ELLs in all subgroups are also offered several opportunities for language development and support throughout the  school day including:  extended day services, enrichment activities, fine and performing arts programs, service organizations  and direct academic intervention provided by a certified special education teacher.    For former ELLs, who have tested out of the program but are entitled to 90 minutes a week of ENL instruction, our ENL teacher  offers specific support grounded in grade-level content-area themes. Students participate in cooperative and project-based   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      learning groups throughout the school year. Project-Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge  and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex  question, problem, or challenge. This allows for an enriching and engaging experience for our former ELLs.    Students who have been receiving ESL services for six years are rare in an elementary setting, but when we do have such  students a plan is put in place with the help of our Academic Intervention team to make sure their needs are being met.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use a variety of age and grade-appropriate instructional materials to support our English language learners.  Native  language dictionaries, language development software and subscriptions to the online programs Pebble Go (a nonfiction  reading website) and RAZ kids (a website that supports independent reading on the student’s level) are made available to  these students to build vocabulary, provide support in content areas and strengthen reading abilities. The children may also  access these programs at home, or the school’s own library.  High quality literature that includes an emphasis on multicultural  themes and nonfiction is part of our balanced literacy instruction to provide relevant reference points for our ELLs. The  Benchmark series English Explores provides multi-level texts, visuals and software to allow students to experience grade  appropriate content-area subjects on their proper reading level, with built-in visual and vocabulary supports.  All teachers have  access to Smartboard technology to help them provide visuals aids (pictures and video clips) that enhance the curriculum by  providing clarity to new and challenging topics. When available or mandated, native language support is offered through  alternate placement paraprofessionals and staff.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  It is important to note that all teachers and support staff who serve these students are given time to read the IEPs and  understand the students’ goals. Our school allows for scheduling flexibility to help our ELL SWDs flourish.  After initial  assessments are analyzed in the fall (and benchmark assessments are analyzed throughout the school year) students capable  of mainstreaming for specific subject areas are identified and a plan is put into place. Also, because 6 of our ELL students are  classified with an Intellectual Disability and are mandated to receive many pull-out services throughout the school day, our ESL  teacher pushes in to their classroom so they do not miss valuable classroom time.  She works closely with their classroom  teacher, paraprofessionals and related service providers to provide lessons that target language development and align with  their IEP goals and school curriculum. Our SETSS teacher often integrates ELL SWD into her small groups to provide additional  support in varied settings, whether pull-out or push-in.  Our literacy coach provides additional push-in and pull out services to  support these students in language and literacy development, as well in all content areas. In addition, she and our ESL teacher  make themselves available to support teachers who need help planning lessons to best meet the needs of all of their students,  specifically ELLs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program for English Language Learners in ELA includes the Fountas and Pinnel Leveled Literacy  Intervention Program. Our ENL teacher uses this program, and it is also available for classroom teachers to use as well.  This  program is an intensive, small-group, supplementary literacy intervention for students who find reading and writing difficult.  The goal of LLI is to lift the literacy achievement of students who are not achieving grade-level expectations in reading. It  provides strong support for students who are acquiring English as an additional language and who are receiving classroom  reading instruction in English. This program is appropriate for students in all ELL subgroups, but has been found to be  especially helpful for ELL-SWDs in Grades 2 and 3.      The SETSS teacher provides services to our ELLs in grades 3-5, who have had 4 or more years of ESL service. She makes use of a  program called SPIRE which is intensive reading intervention for struggling readers. It is a multi-sensory program to support  the lowest-performing students. With it, the teacher provides data-driven instruction with continual practice and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      reinforcement.    Our Literacy coach services all subgroups of ELLs and  plans her lessons based on assessment data from the Fountas and Pinnell  Benchmark Assessment results She provides support in the student’s the areas of weakness, through guided reading sessions  and word study lessons that employ strategies from Orton-Gillingham.    Classroom teachers have access to a variety of intervention materials including Great Leaps for both reading and math, Wilson  Fundations and Wilson Language, and the Go Math intervention series.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     Based on teacher feedback, teacher observations done by the administration and student assessment data, including  NYSESLAT results, the need for a more uniform and comprehensive writing program across the grades has determined.  Therefore, we will continiue to implement the Teacher’s College Units of Study for Writing in all grades for the 2018-19 school  year. These units of study include include strategic performance assessments to help monitor mastery and differentiate  instruction, develop and refine strategies for writing across the curriculum, and teach opinion/argument, information, and  narrative writing with increasing complexity and sophistication. These units will complement the TC Reading Units of Study  that we rolled out the 2016-17 school year. This reading program was adopted after reading assessments and testing data  from the previous school year revealed the need for stronger and more structured reading instruction in the upper grades.  By  adopting The Reading &Writing Units of Study  across all grades, we will have a uniform curriculum that provides all the  teaching points, minilessons, conferences, and small-group work needed to teach a comprehensive workshop curriculum.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are not closing a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL children are afforded equal access to every program in our school.  They are included in all extra-curricular activities  such as; band, chorus, dance, fine arts and School-wide Enrichment Model clubs.  We partner with Young Audiences New York,  Marquis Studio, Cookshop, Added Value Farm, Puppety Arts, Inside Broadway,  Creative Arts Team and Studio in a School to  enrich all classes in the building.  We provide a special bilingual Spanish/English movement and music program through  Marquis Studio to classes in our building with ELLs and all dual language classes.  It provides a time where our Spanish- speaking ELLs (the dominant second language in the building) are the stand-outs in the class, helping their classmates learn to  speak and sing new words and practice pronunciation.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     We use the following instructional materials and technology to support our ELL students:    Instructional Materials:    Fountas and Pinnell Continuum of Literacy along with Benchmark Assessments (in Spanish for Dual Language classes)    Stephanie Harvey Comprehension Toolkit with the book:  Scaffolding the Comprehension Toolkit for English Language  Learners.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Assessed:    For students whose home language is Spanish, we use bilingual teacher to interview the parent and student along with the  Spanish LAB to assess proficiency.  For other students, we currently do not have assessments available but we do use bilingual staff to interview families and  students with the following home languages: Arabic and Cantonese.    Home Language Support:    Dual Language Classes:    In our Dual Language program, the classes are made of 50% native speakers in each language, providing opportunities for  students to develop their native language in casual and structured academic encounters with peers.  Students are assessed in  both their native language and the target language via benchmark assessments and teacher-created rubrics to gauge strengths   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      and weaknesses in the four modalities and ensure that appropriate lessons are planned and learning centers can be provided  to address specific areas of concern that are revealed. Instruction is delivered through whole-class activities and small guided  groups to allow for differentiation.    ENL:  In our ENL program, our teacher makes use of a cognate word wall to help students find similarities between their native  language and English when the opportunities arise throughout the school year in each unit of study. Students are able to use  glossaries in their home language for math and science lessons when appropriate. Newcomers are assigned a partner with  advanced language proficiency who can lend support during partner and group work. In addition, when available, students  with alternate placement paraprofessionals support the work of the ENL teacher and make sure the student is able to fully  participate in the lessons. Also, our ENL teacher and our school library offer a collection of foreign language books available for  students to take home.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    We are mindful to invest in teaching resources that are grade-appropriate, yet present information in a meaningful way. For  example, we use Benchmark Education’s English Explorers books and digital resources to make science and social studies  concepts accessible to ELLs regardless of their English proficiency level. The texts correspond to grade-level state standards for  science and social studies. They scaffold vocabulary development and include vivid photographs.  In addition, we partner with community-based organizations that present grade-level skills and experiences in a hands-on  fashion to enrich our academic curriculum. Studio in a School Artist Daniel Schaffer works with teachers to create fine art  experiences that coordinate with each grade’s units of study.  The teaching artists with Creative Arts Team use the  corresponding grade’s social studies curriculum to plan their  program.  Their project-based program is developed in close coordination with classroom teachers, directly addresses  academic learning objectives in accordance with the Common Core Standards in English Language Arts (ELA) and other  subjects (social studies and science) with the goal of improving academic skills, socio-emotional health, world readiness and  active global citizenship.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       We are fortunate to not share space with another school at this time.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We currently do not offer activities during the summer as our school is used by a CBO, Good Shepherd Services to provide a  summer program for children. Throughout the school year, our parent coordinator organizes a variety of workshops (nutrition,  cooking, money and finance) and is sure to include newly enrolled parents of ELLs.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    None at this time.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The goal of the Dual Language program at P.S. 15 is to develop bilingual and bi-literate students. Our  program follows a partial immersion program with a 50/50 model of instruction provided by one bilingual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         classroom teacher. Fifty percent of the instruction will is conducted in English and fifty percent in  Spanish.  The method of delivery for grades Pre-K-5 is a roller coaster model with the day split in half,  alternating the language of instruction (LOI) that begins each day.  The student make-up of the class  is  aimed to be about fifty percent native English speakers and fifty percent native Spanish speakers.    In most areas of instruction, (morning meeting, shared reading, read alouds, writer’s workshop, science,  social studies, mathematics) the language of instruction (LOI) alternates.  For word study (print  knowledge, alphabet awareness, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness) students receive both  New and Native Language Arts instruction, meaning we follow the simultaneous model to teach  emergent literacy.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The school’s professional development program for our ENL teacher and all other staff including classroom and cluster  teachers, guidance counselor, parent coordinator, related service providers, and paraprofessionals includes, but is not limited  to the professional development sessions offered by our own staff members (who turn-key what they have learned from  district-led PD sessions), outside professionals we hire and off-site PD offered by a number of organizations.    Our Dual Language and ENL teachers do participate in off-site professional development offered by different organizations  including The NYC Dept. of ELLs, The Brooklyn North Field Support Center and NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource  Network. These sessions are always addressing the Common Core Standards.      The licensed ENL teacher provides workshops for our parent coordinator, guidance counselor, school secretary and dual  language and other bilingual teachers to make sure there is a full understanding of the ELL enrollment process and parental  options so they may help with oral interpretation during registration.    The following is our proposed calendar of PD  for ELL Personel    TBD--we are waiting for the district to post offerings as they do throughout the year.    TBD--we are waiting for the district to post offerings as they do throughout the year.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In addition to PLC sessions, the ENL teacher will provide PD during the after school extended-day professional development  Mondays based on teacher interest and need. These sessions include using benchmark assessments and student observations  to drive instruction, lesson planning to address language development and Common Core listening and speaking standards. All  of this work ensures the teaching staff receives the required PD hours in language acquisition and integrating language  instruction with content areas for ELLs. To be clear, 15%  of PD hours must be related to language acquisition for general and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         special education teachers (as prescribed by CR-Part 154)  and 50% of PD hours the ENL and Dual Language teachers  participate in must relate to serving ELLs, as described above.    Although the exact dates haven't been decided yet, we will offer the following PD sessions to our classroom teachers:      Fall Topics:  Supporting Academic Language in the Content Areas                        Nuts and Bolts--Familiarize teachers with DOE procedures and protocols and other and helpful information to  better understand the  needs of our ELL students.    Winter Topic:  Prior Knowledge and ELLs, Activate or Build It:   Strategies to use in content-area instruction to launch units or  new topics/themes and help with comprehension in the  content areas   Literacy and ELLs how to support instruction in reading and writing for ELLs in the early grades.    Spring Topic:  Modifying your units of study to support the ELL child.     Upon completion of professional development sessions, teachers are asked to maintain their own records and copies of sign- in sheets are kept by the school as well. To clarify, the school staff receiving professional development includes but is not  limited to: teachers, paraprofessionals and related service providers including our speech therapists.  These sessions focus on  techniques educators can use in the classroom setting, or during the administration of related services such as speech, physical  and occupational therapy.  Some topics explored are:  How to best use visuals and technology in the classroom, nonfiction  writing and the ELL Student, vocabulary development strategies and the content areas, using graphic organizers to support  your ELLs, and lesson planning using the Common Core Standards.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The  weekly parent-teacher time each Tuesday allows for our ENL and dual language teachers to set up individual  appointments and provide group workshops to meet with our parents of ELLs.  In the fall, meetings will be held to review and  explain NYSESLAT results the newly established language proficiency levels, the year’s content area themes and the types of  programming the students will receive. In order to make sure parents can fully participate in these meetings, they will be given  in the parent’s preferred language of oral and written communication.  For example, meetings for the parents of our ELLs in  the dual language program will be given in Spanish by our dual language teachers.  For parents whose preferred language of  communication is Cantonese, Mandarin, Arabic, Fulani or any other language, the ENL teacher will co-present with bilingual  staff members or arrange for a hired interpreter to attend and support these sessions.  Attendance sheets from all parent  meetings are kept on file for each school year. Documentation of parent outreach is recorded by the staff doing the outreach  and these documents are kept either in cumulative records or in ELL files for that school year, depending on which is  appropriate. For example, outreach in regards to parent surveys and selection preference is logged and kept in a file with a  copy of that year’s surveys and selection forms      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      All parents, including parents of ELLs are invited (in written notification in the language of preference) to attend the many  activities and programs provided throughout the school year both during and after school and on weekends.  The parent  coordinator, school staff or someone from the office of Translation and Interpretation provide translation at these  events.  These programs include; PTA meetings, nutrition and cooking workshops, Studio in a School family art workshops,  weekend Family Stewardship Days where we clean up our school yard and gardens, Monthly Family Friendly Fridays ( in the      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         lower grades), participation in Family Link with Young Audiences New York and workshops lead by the Center for Integrated  Teacher Education..

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Peggy Wyns-Madison, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 15K                                                                              School DBN: 15K015  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The Home Language Survey and the Parents’ Preferred Language Form provide the data that is used to identify  both oral and written language preferences of the parents. This data is included on the Emergency Contact Cards  to make sure school staff are aware of the best way to communicate with the parents. It is included in the child’s  cumulative record folder so classroom teachers are also aware of the oral and written language preferences of the  parents.                   2.

One of our speech providers is fluent in  Cantonese, he acts as an interpreter for  our Cantonese speaking parents at  conferences throughout the school  year.      One of our classroom teachers is fluent  in Arabic. She too, makes herself  available as needed to assist our  parents whose preferred language is  Arabic.      For any other preferred language,  specifically, Mandarin, we use the Over- the-phone Interpretation Services  provided by the DOE. Every classroom  teacher, the administration, our  secretary and parent coordinator, and  the School-Based Support Team has  this information and is able to make use  of this service whenever needed.      Our parent coordinator will monitor the  need for interpretation services at PTA  meetings and on school stewardship  days in order to make sure interpreters  are provided, either through the use of  school staff or The Big Word.   PTA Board members will coordinate  with our Language Access Coordinator   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Students with disabilities have  annual meetings with their teacher  and/or our special education liaison  and/or School-Based Support Team.    As required by IEP   to provide interpretation services  during these meetings.   During these meetings, bilingual  glossaries for special education  terminology are available to the  parents. Parent Notification Letters in  regards to the IEP are printed in the  parents preferred language.       The school-based support team  includes bilingual staff members, but  they also make use of the over-the- phone language interpretation services  for IEP meetings when necessary.           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In case of emergency, we will be sure to reach LEP families though the use of bilingual staff members, the over-the- phone interpretation services, school-related social media, and/or our communication app SchoolCNXT.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      In order to make sure school staff members are aware of Chancellor's Reg A-663, it will be included in the Teacher's  Manual and reviewed during a PD session at the start of each school year for the entire school staff. As stated above,  teachers will all have access to over-the-phone interpretation services. Our Language Access Coordinator will hang the  multilingual welcome poster at the entrance of our school and pamphlets (including the language identification guide)  for parents will be available at the front desk and in the main office. Once we determine a parent's preferred language  of communication, this is noted for the teachers and for staff so parent notices will be given in the preferred  language.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Our school will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services by first making  every staff member aware of them. Section VII of CR A-663 will be reviewed during a school-wide professional  development sessions. We will make use of the checklist above to ensure that all aspects of parental notification are  properly addressed. Our parent coordinator is the designated Language Access Coordinator, and together with the  ENL teacher they will ensure that our parents are provided a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights in their preferred  language of communication. Signs are posted at and near the primary entrance of our school that indicate the  availability of interpretation services. An I Speak card and Language identification Guide are at the security desk and in  a visible designated area in the main office with other language access materials to support parents. In addition, our  school’s safety plan includes procedures to support parents in need of language access services so they always have  access to reach the school’s administrative offices, including the guidance office and School-Based Support Team.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       During Open School Nights we will gather feedback from parents via written anonymous surveys on the quality and  availability of translation and interpretation services. We will also use the results of the DOE School Environment  Survey as well.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62
