This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   There are three anchors of Bronx Haven's mission engagement, communication and collaboration. Students engage in  peer to peer discussions, adults create a safe and nurturing environment, and provide students the Social and  Emotional support. We maintain open communication between all stakeholders and keep parents updated on school  administration plan with the Community Based Organization CBO (East Side House) school events and activities for  the year to ensure that all of our students are college and career ready with the skills needed to be productive in a  21st century world.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Bronx Haven is a Transfer High School, which opened its doors to overage under credited youth in September 2007.  Transfer schools were introduced as an alternative model to address the differentiated needs and supports for this  off-track population. The Transfer School model affords students the opportunity for credit acceleration, as well as  post-secondary planning and preparation while providing students with full socio-emotional supports through  partnering with a Community Based organization (CBO). Together we work to form a personalized learning  environment where students are well known and develop individualized pathways to graduation and beyond.  Bronx Haven was designed in full partnership with East Side House Settlement a Community Based Organization  serving the South Bronx. As the founding staff of a transfer school, we were charged with being innovative in our  school design. In alignment with the element of collaboration in the Framework for Great Schools our school was a  collaborative effort from from inception to develop a school design, to address the many obstacles faced by the  overage under-credited student population of the Bronx. Our planning team included 2 teachers, a guidance  counselor, social workers, two GED students, two principals and a parent advocate. We began with an understanding  that if we were to be successful we had to engage all the stakeholders from the beginning. Once the actual staff was  hired over the first summer, we continued to operate under this premise and maintain one of the strongest existing  NYCDOE – CBO partnerships.     Bronx Haven is collaboratively led by our principal and CBO Director. Our staff is comprised of 19 full time DOE  employees and 10 full time CBO employees, who collaborate daily in order to operate as one staff to meet both the  academic and social emotional needs of our young adults. We support this seamless partnership through consistent  communication and regular team building team opportunities, such as an annual all staff retreat, periodic all staff  professional development, and teacher – advisor project collaboration.   As a Transfer High School we utilize various systems and structures to address truancy, social emotional challenges,  and lack of credit accumulation, three of the most common barriers to graduation for our population.   Our primary vehicle for family collaboration is our Student Advisory system , which is based on a “primary person”  approach, where each student has a specific person to whom they go for guidance, support, and referral. All Bronx  Haven students are matched to a student Advisor at intake and remain with that same advisor until they graduate.  The advisors are responsible for daily attendance outreach including wake up calls, parent calls, and home visits.  Advisors have open and regular communication with families ranging from daily to monthly phone calls to keep  parents informed on student academic progress, attendance and all other challenges, and concerns. Advisors  conduct home visits when students have consecutive unexplained absences or when they have been unable to  contact a parent. They are the primary facilitators of communication between the families and the Bronx Haven  community.   One of our collaborative teacher-advisor systems is the Student Teacher Advisor Conference . A STAC is a  conference, which may be requested by the student, teacher or advisor. The conferences can be requested to  facilitate communication around many issues or concerns such as attendance and lateness, grades, engagement,  classroom environment, academic and social emotional progress. Teachers and advisors briefly discuss the  concerns being brought to the conference in order to prepare. Advisors prepare students to clarify and express  their positions prior to the meetings if necessary and play the role of advocate for the student in the conferences.   Our school operates on a trimester schedule with a benchmark structure . The schedule provides our students with  shorter cycles and additional annual credit accumulation opportunities. Our students are able to earn 6 credits a  cycle culminating in 18 for the school year. The cycles are structured in four three-week benchmarks. Curriculum  units are designed around these benchmarks, which culminate in formative assessments. Teachers maintain daily  grades and students receive progress reports at the end of each benchmark. The following Tuesday advisors  distribute and discuss progress reports with students and reports are mailed home to parents. Our benchmark  structure was originally two weeks long but as we shifted instruction to align with Common Core Standards we  decided to provide an additional week to facilitate more process-oriented learning opportunities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         In addition to our very successful school-CBO partnership, at Bronx Haven we are proud of our strong school  culture and learning environment. We maintain a welcoming and safe school environment in order to reengage our  young people both socially and academically. We maintain a community where young people are recognized and  supported. Our students often refer to Bronx Haven as their second home. In a recent focus group conducted at the  school many students identified the school as the place in the Bronx where they feel the greatest sense of success  and safety. Our classrooms are based on an environment of trust and student voice, where students are both  challenged and supported in their learning.     Bronx Haven will continue to participate in the NYCDOE Transfer School Common Core Institute (TSCCI). Through  our participation we have received on site classroom coaching as well as the support and facilitation of three staff  inquiry projects by an outside consultant. Our most recent inquiry work includes; the development of Grading  Policy rubrics, which incorporate the assessment of academic behaviors; and the study of academic mindsets and  the creation of student feedback systems. Our participation in TSCCI also allowed us to share and learn best  practices through collaboration with other transfer school communities. The Bronx Haven staff is excited about the  prospect of conducting inquiry work around scheduling over the next 2-3 years in order to create additional  learning opportunities.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   All of Bronx Haven high school's teachers teach ICT classes, we work specifically with students who are overage and  over-credited who have IEP's.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Key Area of Focus    Since the students at Bronx Haven are overage and under credited, the focus is on providing courses that cater to  where students are academically. Hence we work on a trimester model allowing students to earn their 18 credits and  as much as possible meet students where they are in their gaps and offer those courses.   We work very closely with students to foster relationships that allow us to help students change past behaviors of  lateness, absences and truancy.

AREAS OF STRENGTH:   Our partnership with our CBO, East Side House, means that we can meet our students non-academic needs in order  to maximize their academic success. The obstacles our students face don’t disappear when they enroll, and we must  address the needs of our students and their families. East Side House provides six students advisors, and we fund an  extra two positions to keep the advisor-student ratio low. Our primary-person model means that students and  families build a relationship with one point-person, and that person has a thorough understanding of the student and  his or her family dynamics as well as community resources available to them. We have a college counselor who meets  with every student to create a tailored post-secondary plan, and our internship coordinator creates partnerships  within the local community as well as the greater New York City area. Out internship program provide students with  the income they need while teaching them valuable professional and vocational skills and allowing them to work  within their own community.

We build on our own teacher capacity my assigning our most-skilled teachers as new teacher mentors, and by asking  all teachers to share best practices with their colleagues throughout the year.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   For the past three years, we have received classroom coaching, inquiry facilitation, inter-school collaboration through  the Transfer School Institute. This work has built our teachers' knowledge and understanding of the Common Core  standards and how to integrate them into every day instruction. The teachers who have received in-depth coaching in  this area will provide PD and incorporate their work into inter-visitation cycles so that all of our staff benefits.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Bronx Haven teachers participate in a Professional Learning Community where instruction including formative  assessments are discussed and planned. Professional Development on accountability measures is shared every  September. Teachers are given an opportunity to ask questions and discuss their options. The staff and Principal come  to a collaborative decision of assessment measures.       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bronx Haven High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bronx Haven will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38         The school’s Parent Involvement    Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Haven                                                                              School DBN: x381  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

The parents  are also interviewed in conversations n the language of comfort. They are also asked their language of preference.  Upon acceptance all parents complete Home Language Surveys with the Community Assistant. They are informed  again of the availability of translation resources. We also encourage students to share the translation needs of  their family members. Parents receive outreach phone calls from Advocate Counselors in their language of  preference. Office staff are available to speak in both Spanish and English we also provide mailings in both Spanish  and English.When necessary NYCDOE translation resources are utilised.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51     2.
