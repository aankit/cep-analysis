The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview                  Our Vision :   Langston Hughes Young Explorers Academy is a global community that will support and nurture all learners in an  academically challenging environment where the strengths and talents of students, staff, and families inspire a  passion for learning.      Our Mission :   We are committed to creating a safe and orderly environment where each student’s self-esteem is fostered through  positive relationships between students and staff. We work toward creating an integrated curriculum that focuses on  developing skills, knowledge and attitudes essential for life-long learning.      Our Instructional Focus :   Our instructional focus this year is to purposefully increase student engagement framed by John Hattie’s research on  Visible Learning. We believe that all students can achieve when provided with opportunities for rigorous, student- centered, individualized instruction. This year, we will live by the following theory of action.   When educators plan and implement learning tasks that are purposeful, clearly defined, differentiated and  challenging then more powerful and precise learning occurs for all students.    When educators consistently analyze data and provide meaningful feedback on student actions and performance,  then behavior becomes more positive and progress accelerates.    When educators consistently embed peer assessment and self-assessment for learning, then student engagement,  learning and achievement accelerates.         2.

The teachers — one of whom is the  group’s facilitator — are in control of the process of observing, analyzing, learning, and making a strategic  commitment to change their practice based on what they have learned.       Reading Rescue is a literacy intervention for elementary students that involve intensive professional development for  school staff members. Currently there are eleven staff members inclusive of teachers and paraprofessionals trained to  deliver intensive, targeted, research based tutoring that helps accelerate struggling readers’ literacy skills.      We have a longstanding partnership with Generation Ready of over fifteen years. For the last six years, we have  worked closely with the same Math Staff Developer to continuously refine our Math curriculum.       PS 236 works in partnership with Young Audiences and Bronx Arts Ensemble to bring education in the arts into our  curriculum. Each artist residency begins with a professional development session during which the teachers and artist  collaborate to plan integration of the CCLS and the Blueprint for the Arts into the work the students will be doing.      We expanded our programming to provide after school arts enrichment in the form of cycles of residencies in dance,  visual arts, and drumming. Our Partnership with Young Audiences was inclusive of community projects such as  sponsoring community art events and connecting families to develop and create an arts installment in the 176th  Street Community Garden.            3.

Our schoolwide intervention period ensured  that students were receiving systematic, targeted instruction using research-based strategies. The biggest impact was  in grades K-2 where 74% of students acheived grade level benchmark on the iReady end of year diagnostic. Moreover,  0% of K-2 students were considered at-risk(2 or more levels below) on the iReady end of year diagnostic. Our key area  of focus continues to be maximizing student engagement and ownership of learning through metacognition, tasks  involving productive struggle, and meaningful discourse.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X236   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   291   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The Spring 2018 NYS ELA exam results indicate that 30% of grade 3-5 students met grade level proficiency- a 2  percentage point increase in comparison to 2017. The Spring 2018 NYS Math examination results indicate that 34% of  grade 3-5 students at our school met grade level proficiency- a 5 percentage point increase in comparison to 2017.  There was also a reduction of students performing at level one in NYS Math by 3% and 2% in ELA.   Analysis of the 2018 instructional report reveals the following:    ELA   3rd Grade - Our 3rd grade cohort performed 13 points below the city. Performance relative to the city was similar  across multiple choice and response questions in both classes. As with your other cohorts, short response questions  were an area of challenge.   4th Grade - Our 4th grade cohort closed the gap with the city from when these same students were in 3rd grade.  Student were 3 points below the city overall and only 1 point below the city in multiple choice (same students were 7       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16      points below in multiple choice as 3rd graders). Short response questions where where your students performed  weakest relative to the city.    5th Grade - Our 5th grade cohort declined in performance relative to the city from 4 points below as 4th graders in  2017 to 12 points below the city in 2018. The performance gap below the city widened across both multiple choice  and response. The largest gaps with the city were on short response questions were among those where our 5th  graders performed worst relative to the city.      Math   3rd Grade - 3rd grade students performed 12 points below the city overall. As a grade, students scored the weakest  relative to the city within the strand of Measurement and Data - similar to our 4th grade students. The areas where  students score weakest relative to the city were on 3.MD.A.1 and 3.MD.B.3 .    4th Grade - Our 2017-2018 4th grade cohort improved relative to the city, scoring just 1 point below the city average  in 2018 (compared to 7 points below the city as 3rd graders in 2017). Gains were especially strong in class 401, which  performed 3 points above the city average in 2018 (these same students were 6 points below the city as 3rd graders  in 2017). Students made significant strides in their performance relative to the city on response questions as well as  performance in the strand of Numbers in Base Ten. The largest gaps with the city were in the strand of Measurement  and Data - particularly 4.MD.C.5.b (question 36), 3.MD.D.8 (question 27), 4.MD.C.7 (question 44), and 3.MD.B.4  (question 4) see page 9 of Math detail report. When is the measurement and data strand taught in 3rd grade? Given  that 2 of the weakest areas relative to the city were on 3rd grade standards, I am curious if those standards are being  retaught or assessed right as the 4th grade Measurement and Data unit begins.    5th Grade - Our 2017-2018 5th grade cohort performed 15 points below the city in 2018 which was a decline from  their performance relative to the city as 4th graders in 2017 (12 points below the city). The largest gaps with the city  were within the strands of Numbers and Fractions and Numbers in Base Ten - the same 2 strands that these same  students struggled with as 4th graders in 2017. 5.NF.B.7.c and 5.NF.A.1 were the two areas where students struggled  most relative to the city.    An examination of the results of the state math assessment against the common core math standards indicates that  our students demonstrate strength in geometry, unit fractions of a whole, and applying properties of operations as  strategies to multiply and divide. Students need to strengthen understanding of area, for example, relating area to  multiplication and division, they continue to struggle with the concept of place value, and multiplication and two step  word problems on grade 3, place value, comparison of fractions, multiplying fractions by whole numbers, and multi- step word problems in the constructed response on grade 4, measurement and data, adding and subtracting fraction  with unlike denominators, and continue to needs support with place value on grade 5. We find that writing is a  barrier as indicated in overall weakness in constructed responses and needs to be addressed in both ELA and  Mathematics.   Our Spring 2018 Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment results for reading indicate that 55% of students in  grades K – 5 met or exceeded grade level benchmark, which represents an 6% increase over Spring, 2017. The Spring  2018 I-Ready data indicates that 60% of K- 5 students scored at or above grade level expectations in reading and 56%  of K - 5 students scored at or above level in mathematics, a 11% and 8% increase in comparison the Spring 2017.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 236, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 236 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template      PS 236, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

The  Title III after school program will service 46 ELLs in Kindergarten through 5th grades.  The  program will house all levels of ENL learners across grades K-5.  There are 11 Kindergarteners  who were identified as ELLs based upon the NYSITELL.  Based on 2018 NYSESLAT  and  NYSITELL results, proficiency levels for students in Grades 1-5 break down as follows:  Grade  1:  1 Entering, 4 Emerging, 5 Transitioning, 2 Expanding;  Grade 2:  2 Emerging, 4  Transitioning, 1 Expanding;  Grade 3:  2 Emerging, 1 Transitioning, 8 Expanding;  Grade 4:  1  Emerging;  Grade 5:  3 Transitioning, 1 Expanding.          The program will meet on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons for 90 minutes each day  from October 19, 2018 through May 4, 2019 (50 sessions).  In order to address the needs of our  English Language Learners, the students will be grouped by grade level.  The program will be  comprised of five (5) classes divided as Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grades 3, and Grades 4,  5.  Students will be further subgrouped by proficiency level within the classes to ensure tailored  instruction according to student need.          The program will focus on promoting success on the NYSESLAT, supporting Common  Core curriculum goals, and helping students overcome language barriers.  The program will use  direct instruction to emphasize the four language modalities as assessed by the  NYSESLAT.  Students will work in collaborative learning situations, which will provide them  with opportunities to use language with many different audiences.  We consider technology to be  an integral part of the program and give the students use of SmartBoards and computer programs  to enhance and reinforce learning.  Each classroom has multiple computers.  In addition, there  are ELMOs available for use in the building to enlarge and enhance print and read-aloud  experiences.  We have digital recorders which students can speak into and then listen to what  they have said in order to improve oral language development.         Approximately 50 minutes of each session will be devoted to literacy.  In the lower grades we  will focus on initial/beginning sounds, final/ending sounds, and blends using various literacy  games and online activities for reinforcement.  Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention  (LLI) will be used for supplemental intensive small group reading instruction.  "Discussions 4  Learning" by Davis Publishing will be used to support oral language, and vocabulary  development.  Upper grade ELLs who must take the ELA test in April will participate in an ELA  block to improve their literacy skills in English. "HOT Topics" (High Interest Reading)  by Evan  Moor Publishing will be used to give direct instruction of reading strategies through the use of  engaging text.  Each lesson is leveled and has a specific reading strategy, explicit teaching of key  vocabulary words and text features, guided reading strategies to improve comprehension, and  opportunities to reflect on the reading through discussion and written response. There is an       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   accompanying audio CD specifically designed to give extra support to English Language  Learners.       In addition, all grades will use the supplemental book Attanasio & Associates, Inc.'s "Getting  Ready for the NYSESLAT", which is designed to replicate each section of the NYSESLAT and  assist in familiarizing the students with the state assessment.  This program gives practice in  multiple-choice, written response, and oral-response questions through the listening, reading,  writing, and speaking domains.  This portion of the after-school session will last approximately  30 minutes.               Four certified ENL teachers and 1 Content Area/Common Branches teacher (co-teaching  with an ENL teacher)  will provide direct instruction in the after school program.  Instruction  will be in English, with native language support when necessary.  Attendance records are  maintained by the teachers and parents are notified about both the availability of the program and  updates/changes to the program in their preferred languages.

All teachers of  English Language Learners are included in professional development opportunities, both outside  the school and during the Monday Professional Development cycles.  Between our Professional  Development time on Mondays and outside professional development organized by various  education centers, the 50% of total hours for bilingual and ENL educators will be met.           We have a literacy staff developer from Teaching Matters working closely with grades K- 3.  The staff developers will each provide 30 days of in-house professional development.  The  staff developer provides demonstration teaching and collaborative coaching within classroom lab  sites for teachers to learn the structures, methods, and expectations for a rigorous reading and  writing workshop.  Classrooms of teachers of ELLs are included on the rotation of designated lab  sites on each grade level.           In addition to the on-site school coaching by Teaching Matters staff developers, all teachers  of ELLs are invited to participate in various Teachers College "Calendar Day" conference days  on campus at Teachers College.  Teachers of ELLs have participated in:  --Adapting Reading and Writing Units of Students to Support Classrooms Full of English  Language Learners  --Strategies for Reading for English Language Learners Who Struggle (and for All Your  Readers!)  --Small Group Work in Reading and Writing with English Language Learners:  Practical and  Powerful Methods for Assessment-Based Teaching Across Many Contexts       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59         Part C: Professional Development   --A Day for Families:  Supporting a Child's Reading and Writing Takes ALL of Us, Working  Together  --UDL and the Reading Workshop:  Strategies for Helping Move Students Who Currently  Struggle With Reading  --Book Clubs and Partner Talk for English Language Learners:  Comprehension Through  Conversation              Our staff developer not only provide in-class lab site work, but also lead a study group  aligned to each grade level.  Teachers work together to help our classrooms focus on data-based  instruction, the Common Core standards, content area literacy, the Danielson framework, and  using formative assessments to support students' progress along learning pathways.  All teachers  of ELLs are included in these study groups.  This component is at no cost to the program.    All ENL Teachers will participate in PD during the contractual Monday Professional  Development time and use an inquiry approach in planning and evaluating the instruction that is  delivered to the children.  In addition,  we will devote Professional Development time to creating  and utilizing Language Objectives during our classroom and after school instruction.   We will  use "Making Content Comprehensible for English Learners:  The SIOP Model" by Jana  J. Echevarria, MaryEllen Vogt, and Deborah J. Short as the text to guide our discussion.  Our  goal is for teachers to begin planning and implementing lessons incorporating the model of  sheltered instruction and improve our ELLs' academic performance and academic progress.

The relationship  of our school community with our parents is one of mutual respect and cooperation.  Our  purpose is to provide the best possible learning environment to allow all students to achieve their  highest potential.  In 2017-2018, we had a 100% response rate to the Department of Education  School Survey.    Based on the results of the Department of Education School Survey, which is based on the Six  Elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 90% of parents agree that their child's teachers  incorporate students' cultures/backgrounds into the curriculum to make learning more  meaningful.  97% of parents feel that our school communicates with parents in a way and in a  language that they can understand.   98% of parents feel that our Principal promotes family and  community involvement in the school.  And 97% of parents feel that our teachers work closely  with families to meet students' needs.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    All materials and correspondence sent home from the school are provided in both English and  Spanish and an interpreter is present at any parent-teacher meeting where it is necessary.  Our  entire bilingual staff has helped to develop a very dynamic group of parents who participate in all  school affairs and activities and serve on the Parent Association.  Parents are also a vital part of  our School Leadership Team.  The parents of our ELLs are afforded equal access to all school  programs and are welcome to join all activities.  Interpretation services in Spanish are provided  at all gatherings involving parents.  Our bilingual Parent Coordinator, our bilingual Community Coordinator, and our bilingual  school Social Worker are on the school premises during the day to assist Spanish speaking  families with parental notifications and concerns. We also access the translation unit’s services  for oral translation over the phone for languages other than Spanish. In this manner we are able  to communicate to our non-English parents and students. Parents receive phone calls and letters  from teachers that inform about the after school program and the student’s progress. If necessary,  we provide an over-the-phone interpreter when calling parents.        We ensure that parents' needs are met through a variety of ways:  our September "Curriculum  Night", Parent-Teacher Conferences, the Department of Education School Survey, Face to Face  Interviews, NYC Schools app, open communication with our social worker and bilingual  (Spanish) parent coordinator, and informal parent-teacher meetings and communication.  This  year, PS 236 has implemented the use of School CNXT, a mobile/Web-based parent engagement  platform.  We use it to keep up the news feed of the school, sharing news and important  information, reminders, and notices.  The app has the ability to translate all communication into  80 languages, as well as the ability to have communication read aloud, to overcome any literacy  challenges.  It has an online sign-up capacity that we are hoping to expand to include online sign- ups for parent workshops once parents become more familiar with the app and its features.       Our school has developed a close relationship with the Community Based Organization Young  Audiences (YANY), and they have become an integral part of Parent Engagement and  Community Engagement effort.  Young Audiences provide arts enrichment  activities  and  access to cultural experiences such as trip to Broadway shows  and  museums.  They have also contributed to community events encompassing parent child  workshops( i.e. cartooning, collage, theatre arts, dance)  and live arts performances (Japanese  Drumming & African Dance).  Lastly, they have become visible in the community by initiating  multi-agency partnerships with PS 236 and NY Parks Department and The New York Public  Library.    We work very closely with many community based organizations and outside agencies to ensure  that our parents' social and emotional needs are addressed and that they are well informed about  topics of their interest.  Parent meetings and workshops for parents of ELLs are held monthly, in  the morning, and address the following topics: (Spanish interpretation is provided)  - October, 2018-Strengthening the Connection Between the Home and School-Discussing the  school role, providing support to parents' disciplinary efforts, discussing  assessments:  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, NYS Math, NYS Science.  Testing  modifications will be discussed where applicable.  - November, 2018-The Middle School Application Process-Navigating the NYC public middle  school application process and identify appropriate school choice for your child, including  students with disabilities and English Language Learners.   - December, 2018-Addressing Challenging Behavior at Home-Practical tools to understand and  address challenging behavior at home.  - January, 2019-No Bullying!-Minimize the risk that your child will be bullied-or will be a  bully.  How parents can work with the school to confront this problem.  - January, 2019-Facebook to Texting--Living a Safe and Positive Digital Life.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    - March, 2019-Learning the essential elements of advocacy that parents need to resolve  disagreement in any system, including entititlements, business, medical or education  October, 2018 - June 2019-  ongoing monthly workshops on math and reading curriculum and  addressing the shift in the Common Core Learning Standards.  -December, 2018- June 2019- Ongoing monthly workshop for families based on the "Cookshop"  program.         Other topics as they arise throughout the year, as well as health issues, may also be addressed  through parent meetings.  The meetings are held by our bilingual (Spanish) social worker and in  the past we have collaborated with the following organizations: Bank Street College, Parent  Resource Center, New York City Department of Health, New York City Libraries (Bronx  Branches), Citizen's Advice Bureau, La Peninsula Head Start, New York City Department of  Environmental Protection, Young Audiences New York (YANY) and the Domestic Violence  Intervention Center.  All notices of the the meetings and materials are provided in both English  and Spanish.         Based on the communication that the social worker and parent coordinator have with parents,  topics for future parent workshops are solicited and encouraged.  100% of parents who  responded to the 2017-2018 Department of Education School Survey indicated that they strongly  agree or agree that they are satisfied with the response they get when they contact our  school.  All materials and correspondence sent home about the workshops is provided in both  English and Spanish and meetings are conducted in both languages.   Records such as agendas,  attendance sheets, and invitations in parent's preferred language will be maintained in a binder in  the parent coordinator's office.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy skills of ELLs in grades K - 3 were assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell and the I-Ready online assessment along  with frequent teacher observations and informal running records for the 2016-2017 school year.  The total school population  scored 51% at levels 1 and 2 and 49% at levels 3 and 4 on the Spring 2017 Fountas and Pinnell Assessment.  Our ELL population  scored 66% at levels 1 and 2 and 34% at levels 3 and 4 for the same assessment.  The I-Ready results back this data up and  provide a more detailed breakdown of the specific skills that our students still need to master.This indicates that there is a  discrepancy between the reading achievement of our ELLs and our general population.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our instructional program is based on a balanced literacy approach.  Students are assessed and their needs are addressed  through mini lessons, small group instruction, individual assistance, and computer assisted learning activities.  An examination  of the data for our ELLs indicates that more Tier II interventions are appropriate and will be provided through our day  program, Afterschool AIS Program, and individualized tutoring using Reading Rescue process (grades 1 & 2).  ELL students are  included in all RTI Tier I and II activities on their grades.  All ELL students will receive customized online intervention utilizing  the IReady instructional program.  ELL students will also receive targeted intervention as part of an ENL Afterschool Program  beginning in October 24, 2018.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We examine all data for ELLs; NYS ELA and Math, NYSESLAT, and grade 4 Science on grades 3 - 5 and Fountas and Pinnell, TC  Writing, and Math Formative Assessments on grades K - 2.  We compare data from year to year to track individual student  progress as well as trends across the subgroup.  We note students who have made progress as well as students who have  remained at the same level or who have moved down a level.  We examine our AYPs with a specific focus on our ELLs.  The  results of this data is used to determine next steps for our programs for ELLs, allowing us to continue successful initiatives and  to discontinue unsuccessful ones.  We are able to examine needs to plan fo Professional Development for our staff that will  strengthen our core instructional program as well as our ENL program.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers analyze data and determine overall strengths and weaknesses a develop action plans and make curricular  adjustments to meet specific needs of students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the annual New York State ELA  assessment, we determine what additional support services to provide the student, taking into consideration evidence such as  the following:       Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program   • English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs   • Results on the annual NYS ELA exam   • English as a New language teacher recommendation   • Content area teacher recommendation   • Parent or guardian request   • Sample of student work in English  • Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or is suspected of having a disability   The support services provided are fully aligned to any intervention plans (e.g., Academic Intervention Services) we are  providing to all students.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The following is an analysis of  the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT results:  One student performing at the Entering level in Spring 2017  performed at the Entering level in Spring 2018.  Four students performing at the Emerging level in Spring 2018 performed at  the Emerging level in Spring 2018. Two students performing at the Transitioning Level in Spring 2015  performed at the  Emerging Level in Spring 2016, four students performing at the Transitioning Level in Spring 2015 performed at the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         Transitioning  Level in Spring 2016 two student performing at the Expanding Level in Spring 2015 performed at the  Transitioning  Level in Spring 2016, and nine students performing at the Expanding Level in Spring 2015 performed at the  Expanding Level in Spring 2016.  One student performing at the Expanding  Level in Spring 2015 performed at the Transitioning  Level in Spring 2016 and one student performing at the Advanced Level in Spring 2014 performed at the Commanding Level in  Spring 2015.  Twenty two students were identified as students who speak a language other than English and were  administered the NYSITELL.  One student performed at the Entering level, one student performed at the Emerging Level, eight  students performed at the Expanding Level, and eleven students performed at the Commanding level.    38% of our ELLs are  Students with Disabilities.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Upon August release of NYSESLAT data,  Administrators review and ensure students are programmed for the mandated  periods of ENL instruction. Teachers and administrators meet at the beginning of the year to review current NYSESLAT data to  ensure instruction in targeted in all four modalities.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our school employs an integrated ENL model for our Freestanding ENL program.  Our ELLs in grades K, 1, and 2 are  instructed in ICT classes with a dually certified ESOL and Common Branch (K-6) teacher partnered with a Special  Education teacher.  The students in the classes are a mix of general education students, general education  heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels] ELLs, special education students, and special education heterogeneous  [mixed proficiency levels] students.  Our ELLs in grades 3 and 4 are also instructed in ICT classes with a mix of general  education students, general education ELLs [mixed proficiency levels] special education students, and special  education ELLs [mixed proficiency levels], with the push-in services from an ESOL/Common Branches teacher.  The  Grade 5 ELLs are all general education homogeneous [Expanding proficiency level] students in a general education  class and also receive push-in services from an ESOL/Common Branches teacher.  There is also one Commanding level  student in that class who receives additional services from the push-in teacher.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ENL teacher in each class is aware of the proficiency level of each ELL.  She provides weekly either 180 or 360  minutes of ENL as appropriate.  In grades K, 1, & 2, the ENL instruction is embedded into regular classroom instruction since  the ENL teacher is in the class full time.  The ENL periods are noted on the class program card and in the teacher’s plans for  those periods.  Entering level students receive 180 minutes of instruction specifically devoted to ENL and 180 minutes of  instruction in ENL/ELA.  Emerging level students receive 90 minutes of instruction specifically devoted to ENL and 180 minutes       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      of instruction in ENL/ELA, with 90 minutes of instruction in Integrated ENL/content area.  Transitioning level students receive  90 minutes of instruction in ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of instruction in Integrated ENL/content area.  Expanding level students  receive 190 minutes of instruction in ENL/ELA and in a content area.  In grades 3, 4, and 5 the students receive services weekly from the push-in ESOL/Common Branches teacher.  Entering level  students receive 180 minutes of instruction specifically devoted to ENL and 180 minutes of instruction in ENL/ELA.  Emerging  level students receive 90 minutes of instruction specifically devoted to ENL, 180 minutes in ENL/ELA, and 90 minutes of  instruction in Integrated ENL/content area.  There are no Transitioning level students in Grades 3, 4, or 5.  Expanding level  students receive 180 minutes of instruction in ENL/ELA or other content areas.   Our one Commanding level student receives  90 minutes of instruction in a content area.  Students who are enrolled in an ENL program do not receive Home Language Arts (HLA) instruction.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content instruction in our all push-in ENL program is delivered in an English Language Development model, which  provides instruction in English with supports to help ELLs with the acquisition of English Language vocabulary in each content  area.  In order to target language and literacy development across content areas, ELLs work in small groups with the ENL  teacher to review vocabulary, discuss and reinforce concepts, and see visual displays to enhance ELA and content area  understanding.  The ENL teacher uses strategies to scaffold the instruction of the class to help make content accessible and  comprehensible and to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.   The push-in model also has the benefit  of English-proficient peers who are able to act as language models to the ELLs.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Since our program consists of only ENL instruction, all instruction takes place in English.  We do not evaluate students in their  home language because we do not instruct them in their home language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  SIFE - We do not currently have any SIFE students but, if we should get a student who fits into this category we would  provide instruction based upon assessed needs as well as conducting more frequent progress monitoring through running  records, I Ready, unit midpoint and endpoint testing, as well as other formative assessment.    b.  Newcomer - The needs of a newcomer ELL will require more explicit instruction in English Language Acquisition, especially  around functional language.  The newcomer would be partnered with a proficient English speaker who also speaks his/her  native language in a "buddy" system to help the newcomer acclimate and form relationships.  Native language support will be  provided by the teacher and/or a paraprofessional.  The specific learning needs of the newcomer will be assessed and  instruction will be provided to meet those needs.  Frequent progress monitoring will be used to track student progress toward  language acquisition as well as in all academic areas.  c.  Developing - The needs of developing ELLs will be assessed through both summative and formative assessment instruments  and grouping for instruction will take place based upon the identified needs.  Adjustments can be made within the guidelines  of Part 154-2.  Progress monitoring will be used to track progress toward language acquisition as well as in all academic areas.  d.  Long Term - The academic progress of long term ELLs will be tracked and examined to identify trends, patterns, and barriers  to language acquisition.  These students will receive very focused instruction designed to meet their specific learning needs as  identified by both formative and summative assessment.  They will be included in all school programs for which they qualify  and every effort will be made to identify learning gaps that may be contributing toward their lack of adequate progress  in  language acquisition.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      e.  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status - All students who achieve a proficient language acquisition level on the  NYSESLAT will continue to receive support from an ENL teacher for two years after exiting the ELL status.  The will receive 90  minutes of support instruction each week with frequent progress monitoring to ensure that the student continues to have  adequate access to all curriculum areas.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      Teachers of ELLs and SWDs provide comprehensible input (speak more slowly, use gestures and body language, etc) to get  meaning across to their students.  Many visual representations are used to for vocabulary and to introduce new  concepts.  Teachers link new information to prior knowledge as well as the students' personal, cultural, and world  experiences.  Key concepts for a unit are presented in child friendly language and language objectives are set for their  students.  Vocabulary instruction is modified to provide more direct instruction including practice in pronouncing new and  content related words.  Small group instruction allows ELLs and SWDs to be included in all learning in the  classroom.  Cooperative group work gives the ELLs authentic reasons to use academic vocabulary and real reasons to discuss  key concepts with their peers.  Additionally, homework and assessment is modified as necessary to allow ELLs and SWDs  better access.  Alternative types of assessment that allow for more oral, visual, or physical responses may better suit the needs  of students who are still acquiring English language.  All instruction is based upon assessed needs through the evaluation of  student work, formative assessments, and summative assessments.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELLs are placed in the ICT classes, either as a general education student or an SWD as appropriate.  The class is staffed by  both a special education teacher and a general education ENL teacher or by a special education teacher and a general  education teacher with push in instruction provided by a licensed ENL teacher following the guidelines in Part 154-2.  In this  way the needs of the ELL and their IEP needs can be met within their regular program, without disruption to the educational  process.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At PS 236  we understand the importance of targeting all learning modalities of students by using many manipulatives and  hands-on activities to teach content area curriculum.  Our content area curriculum is based on NYCCLS standards with  instruction tailored to the proficiency levels of the ELLs.  As per the CCLS, Social Studies and Science content is embedded in  our literacy instruction.  Students targeted for additional support in Social Studies or Science receive Tier I interventions within  the regular classroom.  Student ability and progress in Mathematics is monitored through the Engage NY program baseline  assessments along with the checkpoint assessments for each unit.  ELLs who are found to be in need of intervention receive  instruction as follows:  Grades 1 - 3 receive RTI Tier II intervention two times per week during our AIS after school program,  Grades 3 - 5 students receive RTI Tier II interventions during our Saturday Academy.  Students who can not attend on Saturday  receive RTI interventions three times per week on a push in basis.  Our ELLs are supported by scaffolded lessons that allow  them to demonstrate their learning with a variety of activities such as:  role-playing, presentations, experiments, and theme- culminating projects.  The language of instruction is English, as guided by the program models.  The students work in groups  and their tasks and assignments are project based with language and content objectives.  Content specific word walls with  visual representations of words aid in the understanding of content area vocabulary and comprehension.  Assessments, tasks,  and instruction are differentiated to give all students an opportunity to demonstrate learning and knowledge of concepts.  Students who are identified as at risk and in need of additional academic intervention are referred to our Student Support  Team (SST) where a team comprised of the classroom teacher, literacy coach, social worker, principal, and an ENL teacher  develop an academic intervention action plan with specific goals and timelines for the individual student.  Parents are included  in the goal setting and take an active role in helping their child to continue to develop language skills at home.  These goals are       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      reviewed and revisited periodically and modifications are made as necessary.  All ELLs K-5 are invited to participate in the Title III after school program.  Students are grouped by grade and proficiency level  to meet their instructional needs.  Lessons focus on specific skills determined by the analysis of the data of previous NYSESLAT  results, as well as formative and summative classroom assessments along with the Spring 2015 ELA results.  The program also  addresses the needs of the students in preparation for the NYSESLAT.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will be implementing the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project curriculum in both writing and reading this  year.  While planning for the Units of Study the distinct needs of the ELLs will be considered and appropriate instructional  modifications will be made.  Students will be registered and will use the IXL online program for extra support in  mathematics.  This program can present content in both English and Spanish, which may help to support better content  understanding for many of our ELLs.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not be discontinuing any programs/services for ELLs this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELL students are afforded equal access and participation in all academic and extracurricular activities.  Our ELLs are given  the opportunity to participate in enrichment activities during the school day.  Our school participates in a visiting artist  program through Young Audiences, and each class in the school has a residency with an artist.   We have also partnered with  Young Audiences and Teachers College to provide after school enrichment programs in Technology, Dance, Art, and Pottery.  In  addition there is a PS 236 after school chorus and band that some of our ELLs are invited to join.  The programs offer extended  learning opportunities that address oral language development, building vocabulary, reading, listening, and following  directions.      There is an academic intervention Title III after school program which targets our ELL population directly.  The program is  instructed by a qualified pedagogue two times a week for ninety minutes.  All ELL students are targeted to participate in the  program.  Students will be grouped by proficiency level to enhance their instructional needs.  The program focuses on the  development of oral language proficiency and vocabulary acquisition.  Later, the after school program focuses on providing  students with more targeted instruction in the Reading and Writing modalities prior to beginning test preparation for taking  the NYSESLAT exam.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classrooms utilize visual supports in the form of pictures, videos, and games to support vocabulary development.  Teachers  also utilize Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) Model- a research-based and validated instructional model that  has proven effective in addressing the academic needs of English learners.  We use Language Power for our  afterschool program.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At this time, all content area instruction takes place in English with support from the  ENL teacher.  Many of the classroom  teachers are licensed bilingual teachers who are able to provide native language support for conceptual clarification.  In  addition, many paraprofessionals and members of the educational support staff in our school are bilingual in Spanish.  The  native language support given is social in nature, allowing students to express  personal needs in Spanish until they are  comfortable expressing them in English.  No specialized materials or programs are utilized.  Take home books are available in  Spanish.  All academic subjects are taught in English as per the ENL model.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources support and correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels.  We understand the importance of  targeting all learning modalities of students by using many manipulatives and hands-on activities to teach content area       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         curriculum. Our ELLs are supported by scaffolded lessons that allow them to demonstrate their learning with a variety of  activities such as:  role-playing, presentations, experiments, and theme-culminating projects.  The language of instruction is  English in the ENL classes.  The students work in groups and their tasks and assignments are project based with language and  content objectives.  Assessments, tasks, and instruction are differentiated to give all students an opportunity to demonstrate  learning and knowledge of concepts.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All classrooms utilize visual supports in the form of pictures, videos, and games to support vocabulary development,  We use  Language Power for our afterschool        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For all pre-registered Kindergarten students, an orientation is held at the end of the previous school year.  Parents are invited  to visit the classrooms and inquire about the school’s curriculum and expectations.  Pamphlets about the state curriculum and  a parent handbook are distributed in both English and Spanish.  Translation services are available during this time.  In addition,  our school holds a "Curriculum Night" in September, when both currently enrolled and newly enrolled students' parents have  an opportunity to visit their child's classroom, meet the teachers, learn about what their child will learn during the school year,  and learn about the expectations of the school and their child's teachers.  Pamphlets about the state curriculum and the New  York City Schools' discipline code are distributed in both English and Spanish.  Translation services are available during this  time.  A meeting is held after the NYSITELL  exam is administered that allows parents to view the NYCDOE Parent Orientation  video for the parents of ELLs.  The programs are explained and discussed and the parents complete the Parent Choice form and  survey indicating their preference of program for their children.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?   Our school does not offer language electives.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We have purchased the consultant services of several expert consultants to assist us in our professional development  regarding ELLs and all students at our school.  The teachers of ELLs to write Units of Study that are differentiated for our ELLs  and take part in Professional Development throughout the year.  Teachers of ELLs and the Assistant Principals attend outside  workshops and conferences that will help to build their core knowledge about effective practices in teaching ELLs.  Our  professional development program is designed not only to support the learning of the classroom teachers but also serves as an  inquiry model for our staff. Our teachers will have the opportunity to engage in learning activities that will give them the tools  to build the students’ language proficiency, vocabulary, reading comprehension and fluency; and they will begin to focus on       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         using data to support their instruction.  All staff members are provided opportunities to attend outside professional  development offered by the Department of Education’s Office of English Language Learners and New York State Bronx  BETAC.  Staff members are offered the opportunity to  attend a series of workshops centering on providing RTI services for  ELLS.  The staff members servicing the students in the Title III after school program will participate in study groups and collaborative  planning for instruction for 60 minutes per week when our after school program begins in November. The collaborative  planning sessions are designed to give the teachers the opportunity to examine student work and plan appropriate learning  opportunities based on student needs and proficiency levels aimed at meeting the CCLS in all four modalities of learning.  During the meetings teachers are able to share their best practices as well as present issues to the group for assistance or  clarification.   Our staff is provided with access to outside workshops and we conduct training during grade level meetings on the  implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards.  All instruction is linked to the standards and assessment is linked as  well.  Teachers of ELLs are provided with opportunities to apply best practices in core instruction along with best practices in  the teaching of ENL to their instruction.  Teachers of ELLs are expected to provide appropriate differentiation as is evident  during classroom observations and through lesson plans.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS 236 provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English  language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers  prescribed by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language  teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours is dedicated to language  acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  Copies of sign in sheets and meeting agendas are  kept as a record of the professional development provided.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Teachers of ELLs schedule meetings with the parents of their ELLs to discuss language development and the goals of the  program. assessment results, and language development needs in the content area during the parent engagement time  provided each Tuesday.  Additional meetings are scheduled as the year progresses to discuss changes in goals and in needs due  to progress within the program.  We also hold parent information meetings to discuss the availability of programs for ELLs within the available middle  schools.  Our parent coordinator works with individual families to help them find a middle school that will be appropriate to  the needs and interests of their children.  We invite some of the most popular middle schools serving our students to an  assembly program to present their programs to our students.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parents of our ELLs are very active participants in school events, on school committees, and with the Parent  Association.  They are invited to attend all scheduled parent involvement workshops and interpretation services are provided  at all workshops and meetings.  Special information sessions are held to ensure that the needs of our ELLs are being met.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 236                                                                              School DBN: 09X236  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      A review of the demographic data on ethnic background and the Home Language Surveys as well as the face to  face contact with parents indicates that many families within our school community speak Spanish as their  primary language. All communications with the home are sent in both English and Spanish as standard practice.    The preferred home language as identified on the Home Language Survey is entered into ATS for each student in  the school. This data, along with the preferred language for communications indicated by the Home Language  Survey completed at registration, is used to determine which students need home communications in Spanish.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76      There are 320 students in the school. 283 parents' preferred home language is English, 163 parents' preferred  home language is Spanish, 3 parents' preferred home language is French, 2 parents' preferred home language is  Mandinka, and 1 parent's preferred home language is Akan. All communications are sent home in both English  and Spanish. We do not currently have the ability to provide translations in Mandinka or Akan.   A copy of the Home Language Survey is kept in the students' permanent record cards and a copy of the Home  Language Survey is kept on file. The Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) is kept on file. Each teacher receives  a copy of this report for his/her class so that they can make sure that the parents receive report cards and  progress reports in Spanish. All other communications are sent home in both English and Spanish. The preferred  home language is entered on the blue emergency cards that are kept in the classrooms and in the main office.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
