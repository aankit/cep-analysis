This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of P.S. 156Q is to work in partnership with our students, families and the community to provide equal  opportunity to achieve the highest standards of academic excellence and integrity of character.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Laurelton School is an elementary school with approximately 274 students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade  five. The school population comprises 91.22% Black, 6% Hispanic, 1% White and 1% Asian Students. The student body  includes 3% English Language Learners and 17% students with disabilities. Boys account for 51% of the students  enrolled and girls account for 49%. We are at Title 1 School and the average attendance rate for the school is 93%.   As a school, we work closely with our parents and community to further ensure that every student receives the best  education possible. Some of our partnerships include The Laurelton Library, Ridgewood Savings Bank, Federated  Blocks of Laurelton, The FDNY and 105th precinct. We are currently a Pre-K through five school, focusing a lot of our  efforts around early childhood and students with disabilities.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school community which includes 3% English Language Learners and 17% students with disabilities, is charged  with the commitment to consistently provide scaffolds and opportunities for all students so that they may  demonstrate higher order thinking and standards mastery. As a school community our instructional focuses are  questioning and discussion, as well as problem solving. We have 1 ENL student in Kindergarten who is as the level. In  second grade we have 2 ENL students who are \In third grade we have 4 ENL students who are. In fourth grade we  have 4 ENL students who are . In fifth grade there are 5 ENL students who are . Our students with disabilities are  offered the following learning settings self-contained, integrated co-teaching, or SETSS. We also have two students in  temporary housing.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   If we had to highlight an element of progress with the Framework for Great Schools it would be “Supportive  Environment”. Our school community has embraced the elements of the Framework for Great Schools and assessed  our needs using the framework as a guide. Understanding that each area/component is necessary for a school to be  successful, we focused our efforts during the previous school year on creating a climate and culture conducive to  learning that would lead to increased academic achievement. We feel our efforts and resources that we provided in  the area of “Supportive Environment” showed impact as evidenced by the decrease in suspensions between the  2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.      With the stabilization of our environment, we will continue our efforts to improve teaching and learning and direct  more intensive work in the area of “Rigorous Instruction”. As a school community, we will continue to develop and  increase the following:   ● learning through discussion   ● encouraging all students to contribute and participate in the discussion   ● asking questions that cause students to think and reflect   ● encouraging students to explain their thinking and cite specific evidence from the text   ● developing students ability to formulate hypotheses and make connections.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q156   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   260   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After reviewing data and recommendations from the MOTP Dashboard in Advance, our 2017-18 Quality Review, and  Principal Performance Observations, it was determined that a priority need was domain 3b from the Danielson  Framework. In addition, during classroom observations and observational school visits, reviewers stated that the  quality of questions needed to be strengthened. For example, feedback from the Principal Performance Review stated  "continue to support teachers in providing students with more opportunities to engage in thought provoking  discussions that consistently promote high levels of student discussion, participation, and ownership." Also, it was  noted on a previous quality review that “questioning scaffolds to promote higher order thinking in all students did not  occur. Thus there are missed opportunities to create challenging learning experiences across all classrooms to  consistently engage diverse groups of learners and student development of critical thinking skills…”. The 2018 MOTP  data indicates that 32.31% of questioning and discussion techniques, utilized by teachers at the developing level.  Therefore, in order to further deepen student understanding, we must continue to focus on the priority need of  questioning and discussion. The strength as related to this Framework element is our ability to provide a supportive  environment. According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Review, Indicator 1.4 was Proficient. In addition on the  2017-2018 Principal Performance Review, Indicator 1.4 was Well Developed.

The data also shows the number of incidents have increased between the 2016-2017 and  2017-2018 school year. After reviewing last year’s data, the school made progress in reducing suspensions. To this  end, we believe that part of our strength in this area is due to the character education activities that were put in  place. The monthly character traits that were promoted building wide through lessons, assemblies, and parent  involvement has strengthened and had a positive impact on the school environment. The priority need that will be  addressed is social emotional learning. This school year, we will continue implementing Sanford Harmony which  specifically targets social emotional learning. We are also looking to be fully trained on Restorative Circles and  continue to have team members trained on Life Space Crisis Intervention.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Data from the NYS ELA/Math assessments indicate that students have made improvement in Mathematics. Students  scores have increased from 19% to 21.8% "The data from the Framework for Great Schools 2018 indicates that  teachers worked collaboratively to improve their instructional practice." To this end we believe that part of the  improvement is due to teachers working and learning in teacher teams. Although we have made progress in this area,  teacher teams will still continue to be our priority need. For this school year we will be receiving continued support  from the FSC as well as visiting Showcase Schools.   Our strength as in relation to this Framework element is to continuously raise the number of teachers feeling  supported. We will continue to have cycles of professional learning and collaborative communities. Previous  reviewers noted that "there was an increased coherence across grades and increased student achievement for all  learners." This shows that we need to continue to work with our teacher teams to increase their leadership  opportunities and further develop their pedagogy. Therefore providing continuous cycles for teachers to engage in  differentiated professional learning. This will further assist in strengthening pedagogy and set the forum for learning  and growing.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   After reviewing recommendations from the Principal Performance Observations, the Framework for Great Schools  Report 2017 & 2018 and the 2017-2018 Quality Review, it was determined that teacher leadership opportunities  should be increased. The Framework data reveals that teachers influence is an area for growth which is why it has  become my priority need. In a previous observation, the reviewer stated that "leadership structures provide a means  for teachers to have input on key decisions about curricula and teaching practices." Therefore in order to further  strengthen and cultivate teachers leaders, there must be ample opportunities for engagement. Various teacher  leadership teams have been formed for this school year (ex. instructional, curriculum, social..) A strength in this area  is our ability to build trust as per the School Quality Survey.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, as a result of a minimum of 75% of teachers participating in leadership opportunities, at least 75% of all  teachers will receive at least 2 ratings of effective or highly effective in component 4e, as measured by Advance ratings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

A careful review of the 2017 and 2018 Framework for Great Schools Report, shows that in order to further advance  student learning it is imperative that we continue to build strong family-community ties. According to the 2017-2018  Quality Review, we were well developed in establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to  staff, students, and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations. In addition, we were proficient in  maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of  students and adults. As we effectively pull in strategic partners and develop community buy in, student learning  outcomes will further increase. The priority need in this area as determined by the School Quality Guide is to reach  out to parents/guardians more so that they can have opportunities to volunteer time to support the school. The  parent coordinator as well as the PTA will assist in this area. According to the School Quality Guide a strength in this  area is 95% of our parents have been in communication with their child's teacher regarding performance.

Teacher  leaders and the administrative team will collaborate utilizing the data from the various teams to evaluate  school wide needs and create a plan of action. In addition the cabinet meets on a bi-weekly basis to review  data, make adjustments and turn key information to the team. There is also a professional development team  who meets monthly to adjust and readjust the professional learning for the team based on current data.            4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 156Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the ESSA, is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 156Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  DRA-2 will be used to assess our schools early literacy skills with our ELLs.  We will implement a push-in and pull-out model  where students are supported in the classroom with supplementary information, pictures, and vocabulary to assist them in  following and learning the curriculum.  Through the utilization of ongoing research and data analysis, the focus will be to  implement individualized and differentiated instruction.  The continued emphasis for the 2018-2019 school year will be the  efficient infusion of technology, coupled with an emphasis on questioning and writing.  Future plans include the development  of a true portfolio assessment process, the development of monthly newsletters, and a school website that is updated with  translated information so that dissemination of information to the entire school community is immediate, current, and  includes all constituents.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   DRA-2 is administered during the beginning of year, middle of year, and end of year and is used as not only a base line but a  determination of progress as well.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The evaluation of the success of our ELL program meeting AYP is based upon the results of the NYSESLAT. All four modalities  are individually examined to review growth and how we can address the needs of our ELL's. It is during this meeting where we  determine summer school enrollment and possible ELAND review. Letters are sent to the parents as to whether the school  met AYP criteria.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After administering the benchmark assessments, progress monitoring occurs to determine if the instruction students are  receiving are positively impacting their learning.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 156 data used to guide instruction of ELL's within the RTI framework are the results of the NYSISTELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, Math  State exams (where applicable) and ELL Periodic Assessment.) Reframing students responses, confirming aspects of the answer  that are correct, and providing language support to further explain aspects that require refinement. ELL's are provided  opportunities for appropriate peer learning, including peer pairing and small-group instructioin.  Language and opportunities  in response to key words. Providing opportunities to extend answers, supporting language by using familiar synonyms (e.g.,  "this is also like"). This information is broken down by modalities to adhere to the academic needs of every ELL. Although these  practicies vary by grade level, in general they include consideration of the foundational skills such as phonemic awareness in  the reading process, with continued empahsis on vocabulary and conept building throughout the instructional process.  Reading words accurately as well as reading for meaning and learning, are emphasized through listening comprehension and  then later through reading comprehension. We do not wait for English oral language to meet grade level expectations before  providing reading instruction. We provide instruction in early reading while also providing support for English oral language  development.  Language and vocabulary is promoted throughout the day. Students are provided ongoing and appropriate  instruction in academic language usage. Academic language development is integrated into core instruction across all subject  areas.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across performance levels on the NYSISTELL preclude that there is growth from 2016-2017 scores. The  higher scores are in the speaking and listening modality and the weaker scores are in the writing and reading modality. This  apparent across all the grades.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   After carefully reviewing the outcome of the assessments, the administrative team along with the ENL collaborate on how to  further positively impact the growth students are making.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    The Stand Alone unit of study in which ELL's receive instruction to acquire English to succeed in core content courses;  cannot be delievered in lieu of core content area instruction, including ELA. Mrs. Humphrey is a certified ESL teacher  however she facilitates the classroom teachers lesson through ESL methodologies. At PS 156Q we use a Stand-Alone  program. We do not use an integrated ENL program in which ELL's receive instruction in core content areas (ELA,  math, science, and social studies). Ours ENL teacher is dually certified in general-ed and ESL.  Students are grouped by their total score on the NYSESLAT and grade level.       Instruction is delievered by a certified ESL teacher who pushes-in their mainstream core subject areas (ELA and  Math). There is a scheduled common planning period for ESL and classroom teachers to collaborate.  The following is our pull-out model:  Block 1 -Language and Word Study: the focus on Language and word study is on developing children's language and  word study knowledge and skills. Language is developed through high quality literature, poetry and text. Poetry is a  powerful component of oral language from the start. Academic Language Development takes place as children  investigate language as they speak and hear models of language spoken.         Word study -phonics, spelling, vocabulary  Block 2 -Reading Workshop: incorporates guided, independent read alouds within a literary study.  Block 3 -Writing Workshop: Daily writing is as necessry as daily reading. It is important to make a reading/writing  connection.          Guided Writing -develop small groups to discuss aspects of writing.           Independent writing -student work silently and individually on their own writing. Daily mini lessons provides the  bases on the needs of the writers.  Learning New Language:  We learn new language in several ways: conversation, experience, and text. The 3 block Framework for Language  Development is flexible and can be differentiated to meet specific student needs. The 3 Block Framework for  Academic language Development helps to organize instruction and learning. It provides for a high level of language  acquisition for the student.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Entering and emerging ELL's receive 360 minutes of instruction per week. Transitioning and expanding ELL's receive 180  minutes per week. Commanding or proficient ELL's must continue to receive services for an additional two years as per the CR  Part 154 model. Classroom teachers are provided with more support and staff development to differentiate instruction and  incorporate efficient strategies to meet students needs. Plans are to be developed specifically to support the student in the  classsroom.  For the 2015-2016 school year, every teacher of an ELL will receive a letter from the ESL teacher with the dates  and times in which she will have stand alone or integrated ENL services.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Content area support is facilitated through racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity which   is reflected in many classrooms. The school has in increased number of students with diverse needs. These students come  from multicultural backgrounds where English may not be the primary language. The diverse composition of the classroom   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      brings many challenges as well as many opportunities to educators. Teachers can create classrooms that respond successfully  to the needs of diverse learners when they have the knowledge of effective practices and the support of the district,  administrators, other colleagues, families and community members.   With this said, the ways we foster language development is by:  -Creating an environment to show respect for students and a belief in their capabilities  -Communicate high expectations to all students  -Be specific in what students are expected to know and be able to do  -Incorporate learning experiences that show respect for students as individuals in orer to help build self-worth     Academically the curriculum must:  -Build upon background knowledge and experiences of students  -engage students in active learning  -foster individual, cultural, and linguistic diversity  -Promote social interaction  This is indicative of all content areas and of all grades.  The materiaals used for studens are: Common Core Comprehension levels 1,2,3,  Empire Stae NYSESLAT ESL/ELL grades k-8,  Scott Foresman ESL grades 1-5, Phonis levels A-C, English At Your Comman, Access Newcomers, dictionary, thesaurus,  Fundations and Connerstone Levels 2-5.  Sheltered English is an approach we use to teach English language learners which integrates language and content instruction.  This approach provides access to mainstream, grade level content, and to promote the development of English language  proficiency and native language support for the content areas.   All of these methods are aligned with CCLS.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The ESL teacher generates a list of the ELL population. This is given to the Principal/Assistant Principal. The Principal/Assistant  Principal meet with the ESL teacher to verify the list and to access, based on NYSISTELL and NYSESLAT scores, whether the  student would benefit from the administration of the state test, if applicable, in their native language or in English. If the test is  not available in the students native language, a pedagogue is hired to orally translate the exam to the student. Once this  decision is finalized, the classroom teacher and principal/assistant principal are notified of the decision and students  accomodations. This information is filed with the ESL teacher and testing coordinator.  This ensures that ELL's are appropriately  evaluated in their home language through out the year.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      At risk, special needs, and SETTS services are provided to long-term ELL's & SIFE students. These students have specific  individualized instructional issues to be addressed. They may have achieved conversational fluency but not necessarily  academic fluency. Effective programming will include a challenging theme based curriculum that will teach integrated complex  thinking across curriculum areas. Collaborative activities will include one on one conferring with the teacher (i.e. dialogue  journals small groups, peer learning activities/study buddies, and cooperative learning. Study skills and test sophistification will  be intentionally taught through the use of graphic organizers and varying hands-on strategies. During professional  development days, specific strategies and tips for effective instruction of ELL/SIFE students will be addresssed.  Newcomer ELL's use the workbook, Access Newcomers and Phonics Level A to get the fundamentals of the English language.  Developing ELL's use ommon Core Comprehension and English at your Command. These materials further reiteriate the  common core standards and deepen the level of comprehension of the ELA subject area.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      All former ELL's receive 90mon. per week of ESL support.  Current and former ELL's receive time in a half for all exams, formal and informal.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    ELA, Ready Gen is used for Literacy and Go Math is used for mathematics. The ESL teacher uses different materials and  technology that are available in her classroom.  The ESL teachers class sets include 'Phonics' and 'Conerstone' -Longman and  'ESL' -Scott Foresman.     The following strategies are designed to help teachers meet the needs of all the students in their classrooms and to help  make the mainstream classroom more inclusive for English language Learners and English Language Learner Students with  disabilities:  1.Provide Comprehensible Input: Students must understand the message that is conveyed. Comprehensible input is a  hypothesis proposed by Krashen, S., 1981. He implies that ELL's acquire language by hearing and understanding messages that  are slightly above their current English language level. When Newcomers are assigned to a mainstream classroom and spend  most of their time in this environment it is especially critical for them to receive comprehensible input from their teachers and  classmates. When providing information by lecturing in the front of a classroom, the English Language Learner will not be  receiving this input. Teachers will speak more slowly, use gestures and body lnaguage to get across the meaning to ELL's.  Comprehensible input is crucial for providing effective instruction for all ELL students with disibilities.  2. Make lessons Visual:  Use visual representations of new vocabulary and use graphs, maps, photographs, drawings and charts  to introduce new vocabulary and concepts. Tell a story about information in the textbook using visuals. Create semantic and  story maps, graphic organizers to teach students how to organize information.  3. Link new information to prior knowledge: teachers need to consider what schema ELL students bing to the classroom aand  to link instruction to the students' personal, cultural, and world experiences. Teachers also need to know what their students  do not knnow. They must understand how culture impacts learning in their classsroom.  4. Determine key concepts for the unit and define language and content objects for each classroom: Teachers write the key  concept for a unit of study in studetn-friendly lnauage and post it in the classroom. New learning should be tied to this  concept. Additiionally, teachers should begin each lesson by wtiting a cintentobjective on the board. At the end of the lesson,  students should be asked if the objective was met. Clssroom teachers also need to set language objectives for the ELL's/ELL  SWD in their class. A lnaguage objective might be to learn new vocabulary, find the nouns ina lesson, or a pply a grammar rule.  5. Modify vocabulary instrudtion of ELL's/ELL SWD: English language learners with and withoutdisabilities require direct  instruction of new vocabulary. Teachers should also provide practice in pronouncing new words. ELLs/ELL SWD need much  more exposure to new terms, words, ididom, and phrases than do English fluent peers. Teachers need to tie new vocabulary to  prior learning and use visual to reinforce meaning. Content area teachers should teach new vocabulary words that occur in the  text as well as those relataed to the subject matter.  Word wall should be used at all grade levels.  6. Use cooperative learning strategies:  Lecture style teaching excludes ELL's/ELL SWD from the learning ina classroom. We  don't want to relegate ELL's/ELL SWD to the fringes of the classroom doing a separate lesson with a classroom aide, ENL  teacher  beneficial to ELLs/ELL SWD who have an authentic reson to use academic vocabulary and real reasons to discuss key  concepts. ELLs/ELL SWD benefit from cooperative learning structures. Monitor that they are actively participating.   7. Modify testing and homework for ELLs/ELL SWD: Content area homework and assessments needs to be differentiated for  ELLs ELL SWD. Teachers should all alternative types of assessment: oral, drawings, physical response (e.g., act-it-out) , and  manipulatives as well as modifications to the test. Homework and assessment should be directly linked to classroom  instruction and students should be provided with study guides so that they know what to study. Remember that te ELLs/ELL  SWD in your class may not be able to take notes.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We set high yet reasonable instructinal expectations that provide ongoing instructional support to ensure that ELL-SWD's  expectations are met. PS 156Q ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers by  incorporating a curriculum that ELL's are being provided with oral language and literacy instruction in English which will allow  students to work on different tasks addressing the same goal. We use different resources to match the readiness levels as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      student work on the same task.  Resources are available that reflect a variety of reading levels for students. Tiered assignments  to adjust tasks to accommodate student needs are utilized. Responding to student differences during the lesson through  reteaching, reinforcing and extending the lesson is also used. These methodologies help ELL-SWD students achieve their IEP  goals and further attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. There is a big difference between  struggling to learn a second language and having a learning disability. Being an English language learner is not the same as  being learning disabled. Before you make a referral for special education, make sure that your student has been tested in his  or her native language, and is not being penalized for not speaking English. Make sure to inform the ELL's parents or guardians  of the steps being taken to find the appropriate program for the ELL. Involve parents and guardians in the process and  continue to inform them of new developments.  The criteria used to place ELL-SWDs in an ICT class is done by using a comprehensive assessment involving you, other teachers,  the school administrator, and personnel from the district's special education office can confirm and identify specific learning  disabilities. Referrals of ELLs to special education programs should include the results of tests in the student's first language  and in English. In making this decision, it is also important to:  •     Keep a record of the ELL's problems through school and classroom-based observations  •     Provide evidence that the ELL's difficulties are observed in both languages, and that he or she has not made satisfactory  progress despite receiving competent instruction  •     Ask for and keep a record of the input from the ESL teacher and others involved in the child's education  •     Ask for and keep a record of the input from parents or guardians        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Through the utilization of ongoing research and data analysis the intervention put into place for ELLs in ELA, mathematics, and  the other content area for the 2015-2016 school year is the efficient infusion of technology.  More  , Starmatica, can further  provide a link between data analysis and individualized instruction by providing standards aligned content to address each  student's needs.  In addition, we use Ready Gen for Literacy where students are expected to represent, record, solve, and  explain as they build an understanding of the lesson.  With Go Math, lessons are designed to fully facilitate conceptual  development, as students work from introduction to mastery of each content standard listed in the Common Core. The  targeted intervention for science utilized manipulatives hat were hands on and visual prompts. Science by Harcourt utilizes  hands on activities with manipulatives to assist ELLs.  Weekly readers and online links gives ELLs further visual  stimulation.  Longman Social Studies, teaches ELLs about the world.  Language tips help students understand grammar and  vocabulary.  The science test was administered to three fourth graders (there are currently no ENL's in the eighth grade). Two of the ENL's  scored at Level 3 and the fourth scored at a Level 1. The science exam was administered in English, not in students native  language.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to further develop the implementation of the Workshop Model with the infusion of  technology. Through the effective planning and usage of technology, the achievement of all students will be continually  monitored.  Detailed information on each student about specific learning needs and daily direct intervention will help students  attain mastery. Imagine Learning is an online tool that will be utilized this year to further deepen students language  acquisition.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no discontinued services for ELLs. The students will continue to receive ESL instruction by a certified ESL  teacher.  In addition, students will utiize Imagine Learning, an online resource that can be utilized at school and home.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Extensive differentiated strategies, techniques and learning modalities need to be developed, incorporated, and utilized so  that learning is not repetitive but will have a fresh presentation and rigorous content.  Technology will further facilitate the  creation of appropriate learning increments and level/complexity to meet student needs.  Technology will facilitate interactive  learning where students learn by doing and by giving and getting continuous feedback.  All students will utilize Imagine  Learning, an online resource that promotes on task engaged learning with interactive animations, response required  questions, and guided practice.  All ELLs participate in academic intervention services (AIS) throughout the school year.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Other instructional materials used to support ELL's and ELL subgroups are: Fundations, Reading For, and an audio library. For  technology, students use Imagine Learning and Destination Learning Management. Through the effective planning and usuage  of technology the achievement of all students are continually monitored. Detailed information on each student about specific  learning needs and daily direct intervention help students attain mastery. Native language materials used are workbooks in  math and science subject areas that are in English and the students native language.

Technology will facilitate the creation of appropriate learning increments and level/complexity to meet student needs.  Technology will facilitate interactive learning where students learn by doing and by giving and getting continuous support.  Content area books are Ready Gen and Go Math.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Classroom libraries are heavily multicultural and have substantial supplemental materials that are aligned to core curriculum.  Supplementary information such as picture books and vocabulary assist students with home language support in English.   Three leveled reading prompts are used for below, approaching, and on grade level students.Students start their  comprehension practice at their grade level. Repeated readings and teacher support scaffold students up to the on-grade- level. Struggling students do not miss ut on essential comprehension practice becaue the comprehension questions can e  answered no matter which passage is read. The Common Core Sandards require students to progress to grade-level  competency. Therefore, it is recommended that once students build background on the topic, tey staircasr up to the on-grade- level passage, which includes richer vocabulary and language structures. Theis stratagy is done across all subject areas  incorporating the fostering of native language development.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Effective programming will include a challenging theme based curriculum that will teach integrated complex thinking across  curriculum areas. Small groups and peer learning activities are also utilized. Study skills and test sophistication will be  intentionally taught through the use of graphic organizers and varying hands-on strategies. Articulating specific content and  language objectives. Integrating explicit and implicit research-based vocabulary instruction. Providing opportunities for  students to discuss content and problem-solving with peers. Anchoring instruction by strategically using research-based  practices (e.g., multimedia, visual, graphic organizers, etc…) Providing special education support services, accomodations, and  specially designed instruction to meet the specific instructional needs of ELLs with disabilities. Designing, selecting, and  implementing a high-quality curriculum that meets the needs of Early Learning ELLs.Using .           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Other instructional materials used to support ELL's and ELL subgroups are: Fundations, Reading For , and an audio library. For  technology, students use Imagine Learning and Destination Learning Management. Through the effective planning and usage  of technology the achievement of all students are continually monitored.

NA       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Professional development opportunities are offered to all teachers of ELL's that are non ESL/Bilingual teachers. Grade level  planning periods for ELL's in their various classes are planned to maximize English language acquisition. Strategies are  discussed and subsequently infused into the content area. After school professional development sessions are scheduled  through the school year and notices of ESL professional development courses are posted in the main office for the entire staff.  Classroom teachers of ELL's and the ESL teacher hold monthly meetings to discuss ELL's and other general concerns pertaining  to the ELL's in their classroom. The anecdotals are given to administrative team to be addressed. Through these measures, the  school and principal/assistant principal are held accountable for improvement in the academic achievement of ENL students.  In addition, the fourth Monday of each month, where possible has been dedicated for all ELL personnel to participate in  professional learning.     Over the course of the school year, a minimum of four staff development meetings are conducted. Teachers with ELL students  are given instructional support and practices vital to providing the ELL students with the academic tools they need for  academic excellence, even outside of an ESL classroom. The following professional development workshops will benefit our  staff in meeting the needs of the ENL student in our mainstream classrooms.  The following is an explanation of workshops being provide at the school level:  -Workshops on key concepts in second language acquisition theory as it connects to the Common Core Standards for language  and speaking.  -Workshops on best practices for teaching ENL in the mainstream classroom.  -Workshops on using technology to differentiate instruction.  -Linking on going professional development in balanced literacy and mathematics with the special needs of ENL learners as it  relates to the Common Core Standards.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         2.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  To assist students in transition from elementary to middle school, the administration along with the guidance counselor  conduct support meetings for students and families.  In addition, the guidance counselor has individualized sessions with  students to further facilitate the transition.    Professional development opportunities will be offered to all teachers of ENLs througout the school year.  There will be a  minimum of four professional learning opportunities for all teachers.  A sample of these sessions are as follows:  1.  Learning opportunites on key concepts in second language acquisition theories.  2.  Learning opportunities on best practices for teaching ENLs in the mainstream classroom.  3.  Learning opportunities on using technology to differentiate instruction.  4.  Learning opportunities on linking balanced literacy and mathematics with the special needs of ENL learners.  Agendas and attendance sheets will be kept in a binder in the assistant principal's  office.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELL's receive notices in their native langague (for non-English speakers) pertaining to all events related in and out of  the school. Meetings between ELL parents and the ESL teacher are conducted to discuss how parents can become more  involved in their childs academics. The meeting is for 90 minutes. Parents have an opportunity to meet with other parents and  discuss concerns they may have and/or questions.  In addition, we make sure that translation/interpretaion services are  available.  Future plans include the develpoment of monthly newsletters and a school website that is updated with translated  information bi-monthly so that the information is disseminated to the entire school community.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parents are invited to attend all workshops and programs that are given at the school.  In additon, teachers and other  school staff reach out to parents to further ensure their involvement. Parents are notified of activities via telephone, mail,  calendars, letters, etc.  In addition we make sure that translation/interpretation services are available. The parent coordinator  reaches out to parents on an ongoing basis to keep them informed and to foster parent involvement.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Laurelton                                                                              School DBN: 29Q156  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
