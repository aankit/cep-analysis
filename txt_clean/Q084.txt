This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 84, Q has been in existence since 1904. We take pride in providing our students with a high level of education  emphasizing the core curriculum, critical thinking and collaborative teamwork. Our staff, parents and community  members ensure a safe, nurturing, and creative environment that enable all of our students to reach their highest  potential.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   As shown in The Framework for Great Schools, community ties are important to enhance the school community and  learning environment. Our entire school family continuously works to promote strong values concentrating on  respect, responsibility and kindness. In addition to our rigorous academic program, we also offer a well-rounded  interdisciplinary curriculum that includes STEAM. Our continued partnerships with Urban Advantage, Hall of Science,  Spoons Across America, Junior Achievement, have provided our students with a strong knowledge in environmental  responsibility. We have been identified as a “Green School.”  Social Emotional Learning is an important characteristic  of our school community. We have implemented Sanford Harmony as a key component to our SEL approach and  make literary connections through core values book of the month.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Among our special student populations are our English Languages Learners (ELLs) and our students with disabilities  (SWDs). Both groups require differentiated instruction that is rigorous and aligned to the state standards. Teachers  provide specialized instruction targeting specific learning modalities and learning styles.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   After reviewing several data sources, our key areas of focus for the 2018 - 2019 School Year include many of the major  elements from the Framework for Great Schools: For example, Rigorous Instruction - meeting adequate yearly  progress (AYP) for Students with Disabilities with an emphasis in improving academic rigor with ELA and math  achievement; developing, aligning, and writing curriculum that supports our STEAM philosophy; and examining and  researching best practices in ELA to increase student proficiency. By doing this we will ensure that instruction is  customized, inclusive, motivating and aligned to the Common Core. We will ensure that high standards are set in  every classroom by giving teachers the opportunity to participate in professional development. Administrators will  lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff. School leaders will develop and deliver the  instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 30Q084   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   272   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Our staff is comprised of highly qualified teachers whom are placed in their teaching positions based on the needs of  our students and school community. Teachers are placed in teaching assignments to best fit the needs of our  students. Professional development is provided to all teachers to equip them with the necessary skills and  information to excel in their assignments.    Teaching candidates are hired centrally by the NYCDOE. As described in the NYCDOE Consolidated Application, this  process ensures that all NYCDOE teachers meet NYS eligibility requirements. Schools, in turn, ensure that teachers are  HQT, as defined by NCLB.    Prior to hiring a candidate, their credentials are verified to ensure that the candidate holds a valid NYS certification in  that license area. The BEDS Survey is reviewed by the Principal and the HR Director who work with our school to  ensure that every teacher’s assignment aligns with their license area so that all teachers are reported as Highly  Qualified on the BEDS Survey.    Strategies and activities used to attract HQT to our school include:    · Frequent communication with our HR Director when vacancies occur.    · Central Office of Talent and Recruitment partners with colleges and the HR Director partners with Central for  assistance and guidance for candidate referrals.    · Participating in Central Hiring Fair events when pre-screened HQT candidates are interviewed and recruited.    · Establishing a partnership with a local college to support the grooming of student teachers in our search of HQT  candidates.    · Interviewing HQT candidates from the Open Marker Hiring System and The Absent Teacher Reserve pool.    · Establishing a rigorous interview protocol that includes intensive criteria for the selection of new staff members  including demonstration lessons, interviews, and NYS certification/licensing.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      · Maintain a teacher resource center and professional library to promote promising and effective practices.    · Teachers will be provided with curriculum maps, instructional resources and professional learning opportunities.    · Individual PD plans are created for teachers to ensure continued improvement.       Strategies for retention consist of the following: New teacher induction program and new teacher meetings geared  toward looking at student work and data driven instruction. Professional development is differentiated to fit the  needs of individual staff members. Staff members fill out a PD needs assessment survey. Staff are also invited to  attend many of the PDs offered by BFSC.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   A variety of Professional Development is available to teachers both in-house and off-site. Teachers set their personal  PD goals for the year and are welcome to schedule PD sessions throughout the year to reach their goals. A calendar is  displayed in the Principal’s office for all to monitor and collaborate. In-house PD is provided on an ongoing basis.   Teams of teachers plan and collaborate on Common Core aligned curriculum throughout the year. Teachers and  administrators collaborate to plan in-house PD sessions based on the needs of our teachers and staff. Trainers from  curriculum companies are invited to our school for personalized training sessions.    Our Data Inquiry Team creates guiding questions and templates for teacher teams to utilize during their inquiry fork,  which provides assistance towards enhancing learning experiences and reaching all students.

Common planning periods are provided for Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten teachers to discuss student outcomes  and curriculum alignment. Inquiry teams meet to review data and discuss instructional focus. Weekly PD is provided  to align instruction and meet the growing needs of all students. Our Parent Coordinator plans workshops and  activities to keep parents informed and involved. Pre-K teachers utilize the Early Screening Inventory –Revised (ESI-R)  to target specific areas of instruction, which is documented with our Work Sampling System (WSS), which is shared  with the Kindergarten teachers. Our speech and language teacher and our Pre-K Social Worker assist teachers  regarding students who require early intervention services.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our MOSL Committee and Lead Inquiry Team, which are comprised of both teachers and administrators, meet to  discuss the use of formative and summative assessments across all curriculum areas. Our curriculum including Go  Math, Ready Gen, Code X, and CMP 3 are utilized for both formative and summative assessments. Teacher teams  meet to discuss the results and form small-leveled groups for further learning opportunities. Our Professional  Development Committee meets on a regular basis to plan upcoming PD sessions based on the needs of both our staff  and students. In particular, we are focusing on component 3C, engaging students in learning.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 84, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 84Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tools that our school uses in order the assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs include NYC Performance  Assessment, NYC Periodic Assessments, Performance Series, Think Central Go Math Chapter Assessments, DYOs. We also  utilize Reading A-Z Running, all the components of the Records and Reading Recovery Observation Survey (Letter ID, Ohio  Word Test, Writing Vocabulary Observation, Hearing & Recording Sounds In Words (Dictation Task), Concepts About Print and  the Slosson Oral Reading Test.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support our effort in guiding instructional planning for our ELLs we currently have the following structures in  place:                         - common planning time for all classroom teachers including ESL staff.  -dedicated inquiry time on Monday afternoons.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      - monthly articulation time provided for classroom teachers to meet with ESL staff for planning and coordination of  curriculum-embedded assessments.               3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?    We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by reviewing several data sources:   NYSESLAT , NYSITELL, NYS ELA and NYS  Math performance.  We also utilize Compass Learning. We also look at the NYS Report card for our school to determine if  students are making adequate yearly progress in all subgroups. We also consult with data contained in our School  Environment Survey, and review observation reports of staff to evaluate the success for our ELL programs.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered we utilize the following structures to address interventions:                                            - reviewing of data during common planning time  - identifying subgroups and planning strategies during inquiry time  - School Intervention Team, RTI committee, and LAP team make instructional recommendations to the teachers       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]       Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RTI) framework by utilizing 4 action  steps for our school:  1.  Universal screening2. Strong core instruction3. Intensive tailored instruction 4.  Progress monitoring.Our ENL coordinator  works closely with our RTI committee to analyze all data sources to identify students for RTI services. Our ELLs receive  instructional interventions that utilize strategies that are research-based with ELLs. Our ENL coordinator is also trained in  Reading Recovery strategies and uses the research based strategies to guide and integrate into his instruction. Progress  monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and/or services; as well as whether  to consider a referral for special education services. When progress is monitored, the expected rate of an ELL’s progress takes  into account language development and background. The student’s progress is then compared with levels demonstrated by  peers from comparable cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds who have received the same or comparable  intervention. When an ELL seems to be struggling, we ask the following questions to devise a plan for the student’s  improvement:   1.  What kind of instruction has this child already received?  In what language? What were the results?     We ask this question  on all levels of instruction (Tiers 1, 2, and 3). 2.  How can we support the teacher with some new research-based ideas to  deliver effective (core/Tier I)              instruction? 3.  How can we further adjust the Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions to help the  student overcome his/her difficulties? 4.  How can we partner with the family to benefit teaching and learning? 5.  Are there  other factors we can influence, such as motivation?           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         We utilize multiple data sources to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  For example, the data patterns on the  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT reveal that  2.8 %  or 10 out of our 28 students have acquired Emerging/Transitioning Level,  5.6% or 5  of our 28 students are in the Entering Level.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We have the following structures in place to disseminate these finding in order to make adjustments to our ELL  programs:               - our weekly inquiry team and common planning period meetings serve as a forum for us to share out findings and make  adjustments to our programs.  - We discuss congruence of instruction between the classroom teacher and ESL teacher.  - We also review scheduling concerns and make scheduling adjustments to ensure maximum time is dedicated to instruction of  our ELL population.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     In our school, we value the quality education that our ELLs receive on a daily basis and we have high performance  expectations that are aligned to grade level standards.  Our students use critical thinking techniques that are modeled  by our highly qualified classroom teachers, RIT teacher, Content Area teachers and the ELL teacher.  Our population  numbers inform our program delivery.   Since we are only funded for one ELL teacher, and the practice that we  choose has to carefully service all ELLs towards their utmost highest performance targets. Therefore, we utilize the  Push-In-Pull Out model.  Our administration has carefully organized the program models in a way that equalizes the  services provided for all students in small instructional groups that are heterogeneously grouped within their progress  levels.      Our Push-In model pertains to the service of our Kindergarten and fourth grade ESL students.  The ELL teacher pushes  into these grades five times a week and is able to work with Compass Learning in literacy and math, Writer's  Workshop and Ready Gen.  This ensures that the delivery of instruction is of the highest quality and is standards  based.    Our Pull-Out model is utilized with the remaining grades K,1,2,3 and 5.  Since we only service twenty-eight ELL  students our grouping models are heterogeneously mixed.    Our five proficiency levels include: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding.  The students are  grouped according to their grade bands.  Our Entering, Emerging,  Transitioning ELLS receive at least 360 minutes of  ESL instruction within a group setting that stresses quality language acquisition in a low student to teacher  ratio.  Therefore, each student is provided with the opportunity to receive the maximum attention they need in order  to thrive during instructional comprehension of the lessons.  Our smallest group has two students while our average  group size numbers approximately twelve students.     b.  TBE program.

DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our Beginner and Intermediate students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week and our Advanced students 180  minutes of ENL instruction per week, as well as 180 minutes of ELA instruction per week.    ELA support is given to our students through materials in their native language such as native language dictionaries and  content area workbooks, native language translation websites, and native language expression through writing (native  language projects, picture to describe work, and translation practices within the lesson that the ENL teacher utilizes in order  for the student(s) to bridge the language acquisition gap.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The content areas are delivered in collaboration and careful planning of all classroom teachers with the ENL teacher, with  emphasis given to Phonics instruction, reading comprehension and decoding, Social Studies content, Science and Math  content.     The ENL teacher creates the original assessment and study guides for all students in order to bridge the learning gaps due to  the new language acquisition process.  The Ready Gen word content is blended in within all instructional lessons and the ENL  teacher incorporates the Common Core Standards vocabulary and critical thinking strategies techniques within all lessons.    Since a lot of students are auditory and/or visual learners, music instruction is incorporated within many ENL lessons. Realia  are used during vocabulary noun enrichment, visual images through technology and interactive Internet programs (Compass  Learning & Learning A-Z) on the SMARTboard enable students to be active participants within all ENL lessons.   The ENL  teacher aligns all ENL lessons with the Common Core Learning Standards.  The pacing calendar is utilized within all lesson  planning and a strong communication practice is essential with all classroom teachers in order to facilitate congruent teaching  outcomes that enable the students to achieve their leaning goals.   The ENL teacher also incorporates Native language(s) usage  during the deliverance of an ENL lesson.  Throughout the year there is an in-depth study/Project Based Learning/Authentic  Learning on a particular theme (architecture, birds, etc.).  Newcomers and Intermediate students, are brought back on track by  the re-stating of the lesson content in the  student's native language.                 4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     Students are given the opportunity to take the standardized math exam, science exam in their native language.  A translator is  present if the student needs additional help during the exam times.   In addition, we have a bilingual IEP team assigned to our  school. They are able to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year.       5.

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      Our instructional plan for SIFE students include utilizing hands-on activities, such as:    1.  Project based learning, letter to sound recognition with alphabet cards, vocabulary cards with pictures and meanings  printed front to back,  2. Students working in pairs,  3. Utilization of technology with appropriate programs,  4. Individualized instruction with the ENL teacher and classroom teacher,  5. Beginner level reading and writing activities.      The ENL minute instruction for our SIFE students is 360 minutes.    Our newcomers also receive the 360 minute instruction requirement within the ENL model.  We utilize Ready-Gen and Go- Math, Ready A-Z and compass learning.  Our phonics program as well as incorporating these instructional experiences with  interactive websites and Smartboard lesson instruction, while students utilize their notebooks during an activity to enhance  their writing skills.    Our developing students that are here for 4-6 years receive the 180 or 360 minute mandate per week in agreement with their  NYSESLAT level.  The Ready-Gen, Go Math and Phonics programs are also followed in collaboration with the classroom  teachers planning and in alignment with all Literacy Common Core Standards.      Our long term ELLs also participate in our ENL program accordingly within their minute mandates and are provided with  extra support on test taking techniques, adequate explanation of the ReadyGen literacy program that includes step by step  guidance through many required writing processes and vocabulary enrichment through the use of websites and technology.    Also, the Social Studies and Science content area lessons are incorporated within the ENL instruction.  Our former ELLs are also given the extra support within the classroom setting and are provided with reading and  writing workshops as well as content area support within all subject areas as well as vocabulary enrichment through the  classroom instruction and the utilization of technology.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     The teachers of ELL-SWDs utilize an array of instructional strategies and grade-level materials to provide access to academic  content areas and accelerate English language development in the following ways:     - providing small group instruction   - utilizing peer tutoring   - modifying the presentation of content.  - understanding each student's learning style and designing an IEP to maximize learning opportunities  - providing students with access to rigorous material by differentiating the instruction   - integration of assisted technology to support ELL-SWD's modes of learning        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexiblity to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment in the following ways:     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      - ensuring that all ELL-SWD's are flexibly scheduled according to their IEP mandates   - ensuring that groups are formed with smaller student teacher ratios   - addressing ELL-SWD's modes of learning and incorporating web-based technology into their educational plans   - ensuring that instruction is scaffolded and differentiated with multiple entry points          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ESL provider along with our Inquiry teams identify areas of needs for the ELL students based upon data.  Classroom and  ELL teachers implement RTI services for the students.  Close monitoring of student progress is made through data inquiry of  benchmark assessments and classroom assessments.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based upon data and trends and feedback from the Principal's PPO visits, we will deepen our work with Advanced Literacy  focusing on the many different ways of communication for the upcoming school year.  In addition, we will continue the  implementation of our new Passport to Social Studies curriculum. Our ESL teacher will provide scaffolding for our ELLs in the  new social studies curriculum.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All of our ELLs are included and invited to participate in all of our school programs, including test prep classes for grades 3-5,  our Title III programs, BOKS, CASA: Queens College program. ELLs also participate in other school wide programs such as Junior  Achievement and the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).        12.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered within ENL instruction by providing translation dictionaries and websites students can use  as resources. Newcomers are encouraged to express themselves in their native language when writing or communicating with  peers.  We also look for collaboration with Community Based Organizations for additional resources.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our school ensures that all required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by carefully  placing our students into groups of grade bands that are age appropriate and level-based. This method supports the  instruction within the ESL Push-In, Pull-Out model as well as within the classroom setting. Our school leadership, ESL  teacher,inquiry teams, SIT, IEP team all monitor services that are provided to ELL students and ensure that the ELLs are  receiving their required supports and services.       15.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 84Q The Steinway School                                                                              School DBN: 30Q084  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We begin to collect and analyze our data during student registration. With the help of our trained pedagogues,  ENL coordinator, and our Parent Coordinator, along with any necessary translator, parents are interviewed and  assisted with completing the HLIS form, which indicates which language they prefer to receive school notices. This  information is inputted into the students' bio history on ATS, as well as Emergency Record Cards. Our Parent  Coordinator and teachers are notified of these students and their home languages. Language preferences are not  limited to just ENL students. Notices are sent home to these students in English and their perferred languages.  Throughout the school year, we are pro-active with informing parents about the translation services during our  scheduled parent orientation meetings.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57     2.

In order to fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services, we primarily rely on the services of the Department of Education's Translation  Unit. When the need is immediate, we recruit the language expertise of several of our staff members who are readily  available to translate and/or provide written translation for our parents. We also prominently display the DOE poster  in multiple languages at the entrance of our school and in the main office which indicates the parents' rights regarding  translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered languages and instruction language services.   The Parent Handbook is available at all times for all parents. Title I parent involvement meetings are held by the  Guidance Counselor in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator and copies of the Parents' Bill of Rights and Safety  Plan Procedures are available during the meetings and can be found on the Parent Welcoming Bulletin Board.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our intimate school size allows for close and frequent interaction with our parents. Our school coordinator holds  many parent workshops and meetings which creates close parent relationships. Also, parents are aware of the  availabiiity of bilingual staff.  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         We consider feedback from parents in regards to our interpretation needs and we have a "Parent Compact", a written  agreement which is also translated in Spanish. This compact indicates responsibilities to improve and maintain  partnerships, providing parents with their rights of being informed and appropriately aided through the  departmentalized translation and interpretation unit.   Feedback from our parents is always welcomed and we plan accordingly for our future parent meetings in order to  facilitate all language needs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61
