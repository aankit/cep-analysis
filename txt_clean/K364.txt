This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission at Gateway is as follows:   Section 4: CEP Overview      To cultivate a dynamic environment of advanced thinkers, high achievers, and model citizens.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Gateway Intermediate School is a community school housed in two separate academies located in the Spring Creek  section of Brooklyn. At Gateway, our students are provided with a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment that  fosters their academic, social, and emotional growth.       At Gateway we work tirelessly to provide our students with a quality education through immersion in an instructional  program that demands academic rigor in a thinking curriculum. We work relentlessly to develop each of our students  into lifelong learners with a strong personal sense of discipline and social responsibility.       Our mascot is the FALCONS, and at the close of the 2015-2016 school year, all current staff and sixth and seventh  grade students voted on how we would use the FALCONS acronym to define our school values. The winning votes  went to Focus, Action, Leadership, Community/Citizenship, Ownership, Never Giving Up, and Strength. Our Motto is  FALCONS Rise Up by lifting others as we move "Together Toward Excellence"   While our school is housed at two separate sites (Freeport Academy and Geneva Academy) located approximately  two blocks apart, Gateway forges a strong collaboration between the two, thus ensuring that instruction is seamless  and consistent throughout both sites. Our entire learning community, consisting of students, faculty, parents,  administration, service support staff, and our external partners all work collaboratively in helping all of our students  to attain their fullest academic potential, while instilling in them a sense of pride and civic awareness. This partnership  amongst all of the stakeholders in our learning community promotes a continual collaboration, whereby all  constituents take ownership in the process of moving Gateway Intermediate toward becoming one of the elite middle  schools in New York.    Our school includes a 100-minute weekly block to include structured time for teacher teams to meet. This is a  wonderful opportunity to engage teachers in consistent and structured professional conversations surrounding the  teaching and learning practices taking place within our learning community. This time allows our school to implement  a system whereby teachers have a structured way to look at data and student work while examining curriculum and  teacher practice. It also affords our faculty the opportunity to assess/diagnose what changes and supports are needed  to improve performance for our neediest students. This work ties directly into the attainment of our school-wide  goals and serves as a forum where those goals can be monitored and revisited on a consistent basis.   As middle school educators, we fully understand the importance of teaching the “whole” child. Understanding this  delicate stage in our students’ development, as they become more independent thinkers, we are constantly  challenged to seek ways that promote their academic, social, and emotional growth. It is imperative that our learning  environment provide each of our students a nurturing and loving atmosphere, where high expectations are the norm  and each of our children feel safe and supported. To this end, we have worked diligently to create a youth  development and support menu of offerings that serves to accelerate the academic and personal growth of our  students. Our efforts have led us to develop internal capacity as well as build external partnerships specifically geared  toward providing youth development support services for students and their families. Funding for many of these  initiatives has been secured through attainment of grants. Some examples of the grants secured and the numerous  programs offered to our students as a result are as follows:   ● 21 st Century Community Learning Center Grant   ● New York Junior Tennis League Compass Program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Additionally, we have managed to forge partnerships with several outside organizations which allow us to better  meets the needs of our student population as well as support and build capacity amongst our faculty. Some of our  external partners are:   School Response Team - Emotional Wellness     Urban Advantage - Science Education    New York Historical Society - Social Studies Education    Brooklyn Public Library - Social Studies Education      Brooklyn Ballers - Health Education    Community, Counseling, and Mediation - Family Engagement    C.I.T.E. - Teacher Education/Professional Development    Algebra 4All - Mathematics Education    Design 2 Learn - Science Education (Partnership between NYJTL AND IS 364     Literacy Design Collaboration (LDC) - Cluster Teachers and Science Education      Gateway Intermediate School 364 was designated a "Community School" in the 2017-2018 school year. The program  pairs selected schools with community based organization that focus on social and emotional support and  development. Gateway Intermediate School 364 will partner with CityYear for this initiative. Creative Connections has  also worked with Gateway Intermediate School 364 through a marketing and branding project which was  instrumental in creating our Mission Statement as well as our new school logo.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   One major special population we are focusing on for the 2018-2019 school year is our population of Students with  Disabilities. We have a 24% population of these groups of students, which is above the city average, and our 2017  testing data shows this is a subgroup we need to target in order to increase success for all of our students, as ICT and  12-1-1 class performed below the city average.      We will also work to create a Positive Behavioral Intervention Strategy program entitled, "FALCONS Rise Up," which  will be created to ensure that there is a greater emphasis on the positive behaviors that our FALCONS engage in on a  regular basis.        4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of the Framework for Great Schools where we made the most progress over the past year are Effective  School Leadership and Trust. According to our 2017 School Quality Guide, our Supportive Environment score for 2017  was 2.16. Our Framework for Great Schools Report for 2018 has moved that number to a2.61.       The elements of the Framework for Great Schools where we need to focus for the 2017-2018 school year are  Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction. Collaborative Teachers was 3.58 in previous years, and moved to a  2.88 this year.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        For our needs assessment, we looked at our 2018 MOSL Data, our Quality Review, March 2018, our School   Quality Guide, our School Performance Dashboard, our Fall and Spring PPO, our observations and feedback from our  school community. Our strengths, our needs, and our priority needs are listed below.      Strengths     Our students are growing because Mathematics is utilizing Moby Max to track student learning and growth.   o  All 8th graders were assessed frequently using Moby Max, and according to our 2015-2016 Exam   Data, our 8th graders performed on average above the city.     Our students are growing because All-In Learning.   o  Teachers are able to individualize instruction based on the standard-aligned data.    Our students are growing because customized reading instruction is starting to take shape.   o  All current 6th and 7th graders were assessed by June 28th using Teachers College Reading and   Writing Project (TCRWP) Running Records assessments. Incoming 6th graders will be assessed during  September 2017.      Our Teachers indicate that they had the proper resources needed to plan for their instructional units.    Needs     Our students need improved questioning and discussion.   o  According to our PPO, we can grow in 2.2 Assessment. Teachers need to use data to inform   instructional practice, group students and make adjustments to instruction.    o  According to our Central Lead Review, we can grow in 1.2 Pedagaogy. We need to create a common  understanding of rigorous tasks and activities using Webb's Depth of Knowledge and Hess's Matrix.    o  According to our analysis of MOSL data and class assessments, students need to gain a better   understanding of topics enabling them to answer constructive response questions with a deeper  analysis of the questions.      Our teachers need to enhance the quality of student discussion   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      o  According to our 2016-2017 school survey only 49% of teachers had a positive response when it came   to discussion of students responses and how they build upon each others ideas and participate in  classroom discussion.    Priority Needs     Our teachers need to increase the rigor in the questions that they ask their students.    o  According to our school quality guide students indicated that teachers do not ask enough challenging   questions on the test, however less than half of teachers indicated that students respond to  challenging questions.     Our students need an increase in instruction that is strategically targeted to meet their individual needs.    o  According to our Spring PPO, we need to increase customized instruction for our target students. We   need to provide special programs (ex: enrichment, Saturday school) for our target kids.    o  According to our Framework for Great Schools Report, only 61% of teachers indicated that their   students use data or text based references to support their ideas. We need to create rigorous tasks  that ensure that students are taught how to use data sources to complete these tasks.      Our students in ICT and 12-1-1 settings need to achieve higher performance levels.   o  According to our School Performance Dashboard, in 2016-2017, 24% of our student population is   students with disabilities. This is above the citywide average of 21%.    o  According to our Exam Data, our ICT and 12-1-1 classes rank below city averages in every standard   area. Many classes are significantly below.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. I.S. 364 Gateway, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       I .S. 364 Gateway will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   At Gateway Intermediate School 364 our community partnership enables us to build a bridge between home and  school. Parents are given a menu of workshops that take them to a deeper understanding of adolescent development  and provides them with tools that they can use to deal with a teenager. Parents understand the partnership ensures  that children have the opportunity to extend their learning through before the school and after school enrichment.  Students were engaged in a variety of in class and after class opportunities that were both academically and socially  enriching. Lastly, teachers professional development ensure that teachers understood the curriculum and the impact  of planning on student achievement. ]     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At I.S. 364, our LAP involves a clearly defined plan for English language development for our ELL students until they acquire  academic proficiency in the English language.  Based upon data analysis from our LAB-R and/or NYSESLAT, we have 5 ELLs with  a score of expanding and 1 student with a score of emerging.  We utilize Fountas and Pinnell levelling to assess our students'  early literacy skills. With the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System, reading level can be monitored three times  each year. This assessment will yield level (with equivalent grade levels), accuracy, fluency, and detailed information and  scores on comprehension.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teacher meets with the English Language Arts department to discuss the curriculum and determine strategies that can be  used for the English Language Learners.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our goal at Gateway Intermediate School is to ensure that all of our ELL students receive quality ESL instruction via effective  utilization of our ESL teacher in collaboration with their other subject teachers.  The success of the ELL program is measured by  the advancement of the ELLs on the NYSESLAT.  Success for ELL students is determined by the ability of the student to function  successfully in his/her mainstream class. Can the student master the more complex academic language and content of the  mainstream class? Academic language acquisition isn't just the understanding of content area vocabulary. It includes skills  such as comparing, classifying, synthesizing, evaluating, and inferring. Academic language tasks are context reduced. The  teacher's assessments of the student's ability to read, write, and comprehend English as well as their peers on their proficiency  tests is critical.   English proficiency for our ELL students will be achieved through differentiated instruction, maximizing each child’s strengths  and addressing the individual child’s academic deficits.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative data is assessed to determine strengths and weaknesses of students.  Teachers then analyze this data to determine  curriculum updates that are needed based on their analysis.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Currently, as per the NYSESLAT results,  five of our six students are at the expanding level .  All of our ELL students are gaining  proficiency in their speaking and listening skills but require additional assistance in their reading, and writing skills.  Our ELL  population is benefiting from an increase of service from our ESL programs in order to develop proficiency in the targeted  language.    To this end, our push–in/pull–out program provide students with support, academic rigor and critical thinking skills that are  necessary to have our entire ELL population master the English language as well as the other content area subjects.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Regular conferences between the ELL teacher and the content area teacher ensures that the data is accurately disseminated to  all constituents.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.

In the pull out model, our ELL students are pulled out of their regular classes and provided individualized  instruction by our ESL teacher to meet proficiency in the targeted language. Due to the size of our ELL population, we  use an ungraded, heterogenous model.            The push–In model is implemented to provide targeted support to ELLs in content area classes. The ESL teacher  pushes into the ELL students’ language arts and subject classes to provide assistance while the child is in their regular  educational setting.  This method provides students with continuity of instruction and support for both the student  and subject teacher.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              As mandated, all beginning and intermediate ELLs receive 360 minutes per week of ESL instruction by an ELL  teacher.  This is supplemented by the extended day program. The ESL instruction is delivered through small group instruction  with a focus on English language objectives, emphasizing reading and writing strategies. Advanced ELLs receive 180 minutes  per week of ESL instruction as well as 180 minutes of ELA instruction. Transitional ELLs receive supportive instruction in the  same manner.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      With the Push-In Model, the ESL the ESL teacher works with ELLs during content instruction in collaboration with regular  classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time. The ESL  teacher plans carefully with the general education teacher to ensure Common Core curricular alignment.   In the Pull-Out model, ELLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction are brought together from  various classes for English-acquisition-focused instruction. Content area vocabulary is taught in conjunction with English  acquisition.  The ESL teacher plans carefully with the general education teachers to ensure Common Core curricular  alignment        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Assesments for students are provided in translated versions in their native language to ensure fair and credible evaluation.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated according to NYSESLAT score and grade level, as well as by individual student need as measured  by writing samples and general assessments.  Input is also sought from the students’ classroom teachers to further tailor the  class to students’ needs. Focus of the program is on improvement of academic English skills in an effort to aid students with  their overall academic work and preparation for the NYSESLAT.     6a. There is one SIFE student currently enrolled in the ESL program.  This students with interrupted formal education will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      be provided with instructional support specifically designed to meet their particular instructional needs, in the development of  literacy skills and knowledge in academic content areas.     6b.  Based on the results of their LAB-R assessments, newcomers to the English Language School System will receive their  mandated ESL services. There are two  ELL newcomers student at IS 364.   Newcomers/ELLs in school less than three years participate in small group, task-oriented learning activities that guide  the production of language both in verbal and written form.  Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate  needs to facilitate a smooth transition.  In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them  in groups with native English language speakers as well as students who share the same first language as the newcomers      6c.     Plan for ELLs in school 4-6 years   Both the classroom teacher and the ESL teacher use scaffolding to ensure;  •     academic rigor;   •     the use of ESL methodologies during instruction;   •     alignment of all instruction with the NYS/NYC standards; and   •     the recruitment and retention of high quality teachers of English Language Learners.  Academic Intervention Services are provided to students during the extended day plan.  ELLs are offered academic  intervention services in ELA, math, social studies, and science in small group tutorial sessions after school and / or before  school.      6d.     Plan for ELLs in school 6 years completed or more / Long Term ELLs  Long term ELLs will continue to receive their mandated ESL services plus additional support provided through a  Personal Intervention Program that may include additional instructional time through an after-school program and/or an  extended week program    6e. A full range of test accommodations is available to all ELLs and to former ELLs for up to two years after passing the  NYSESLAT.     Accommodations include:  1. Time extensions (i.e., time and a half of productive test-taking);   2. Separate locations and/or small group administration;   3. Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries (word-for-word translations only);   4. Simultaneous use of English and other available language editions;   5. Oral translations for lower incidence languages (languages for which the city or state have no translated written versions of  the   test);   6. Written responses in the native language; and,   7. Third reading of listening selections (only for the State English Language Arts assessments)     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students with disabilities receive differentiated instruction that follows the Common Core State Standards developed for  English Langauge Arts, including English Language Learners. To assist, ELLs meet high academic standards in becoming  proficient and literate in English, emphasis is placed on instructional environments that are language rich and require students  to both understand spoken and written words and be able to express that understanding orally and in writing. Vocabulary  learning takes place through meaningful participation in the content areas. Support services specifically target explicit literacy  instruction across all content areas. Typically, these students perform below grade level in reading and writing, and as a result,  struggle in all content areas that require literacy. These students have different needs from those of newly arrived ELLs and as  such they need to be in separate groups from the newcomers. Long-term ELLs need to focus on literacy in English rather than  on the development of oral language. Literacy in Content - such as Math, Science, and Social Studies - that focus  simultaneously on content and literacy learning are areas of concern. For example, focus may be put on comparing and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      contrasting across content areas. Classroom teachers are prepared to teach language through content. Practice Books are used  to strengthen reading and writing skills       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Both the push-in and pull-out model are utilized to ensure that the diverse needs of the ELL-SWD are met.  In the pull out  model, our ELL students are pulled out of their regular classes and provided individualized instruction by our ESL teacher to  meet proficiency in the targeted language. The push–In model is implemented to provide targeted support to ELLs in content  area classes thus ensuring to maximize time spent in a general education setting. The ESL teacher pushes into the ELL students’  language arts and subject classes to provide assistance while the child is in their regular educational setting.  This method  provides students with continuity of instruction and support for both the student and subject teacher.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Some ELLs require supplemental services to achieve proficiency to meet the New York State Standards in language arts and  mathematics. The New York State English Language Arts test results show that these learners are weak in the following literacy  skills: finding the main idea, sequencing, drawing conclusions, and making inferences. Therefore, extended day activities held  twice a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:25-4:25 emphasize academic vocabulary development, critical thinking,  and writing skills. Preparing for the New York State English State Language Acquisition Test (NYSESLAT) is another important  aspect of the program.  Math intervention includes an emphasis on math definitions and vocabulary, problem-solving practice,  as well as student participation in negotiating meaning for mathematical situations and in mathematical practices that require  output from students. Students will develop mathematical reasoning by making conjectures, presenting explanations, and  constructing arguments.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Future Plans for ELL Programs –Describe changes planned- improvements  To further assist our ELL population in attaining English Proficiency, our pull-out/push-in program will continue to provide  additional instructional support utilizing ESL strategies and the new ELL standards.  We will also continue to implement the  Balanced Literacy prototype.  In addition, we will continue to utilize the data from the Acuity System, ARIS, Items Skills Analysis  Reports, ATS, and in-house assessments to differentiate instruction for our ELL population.  Furthermore, we will conduct  professional development workshops for teachers of ELL students to increase their knowledge of best practices for sustaining  and accelerating the achievement of all ELL students. Common planning time will be programmed to allow the ESL teacher,  language arts teacher and addition subjects to meet and plan instructional strategies to assist the ELL students in the regular  educational setting.  To further develop and execute the LAP, the LAP team will meet to discuss and prepare next steps for the  ELL population.  In addition, if funding allows, we hope to implement after- school program that runs from April-June giving  students the opportunity to focus on intensive speaking and grammar skills as well as the reinforcement of skills acquired  throughout the year      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not Applicable     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded the same eligibility to participate in after school programs as other student. The after school program is  conducted on Wednesday and Thursdays through the school's 120 minute AIS extended day plan.  This initiative is funded  through Tax levy and Title I funding.  Some examples are our NY Junior Tennis League program as well as our 21st Century  Community Learning Center offerings.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We have also concentrated on increasing curricular materials that would enable our ELL students to receive appropriate  instruction that includes both text and technology. Students use a variety of materials to support teaching and learning in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         themes and content specific activities. Computer programs developed for the support of ESL students are also used to bolster  student ability and individualize instruction for ELLs. Instructional Materials and support include: rich visuals, maps,  content  from around the world (multi-cultural realia) used to demonstrate and explain concepts that are abstract and difficult to  understand, sheltered English for Science, and Social Studies, graphic organized and scaffolding support, students work in  dyads and triads, use of charts to break down content.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ESL instruction is conducted in the English language with references made in the students home language, as needed, when  differentiating word meanings and the utilization of context clues. Native Language support is given in the form of peer- interaction and by the use of bilingual dictionaries        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ESL students have the support of their teachers, administration, the parent coordinators, the guidance counselors and all  staff members.  The guidance counselors assist students with middle school and high school requirements.     The parent coordinator works closely with parents to facilitate a positive home school relationship for all students including  ELLs. Information, written and oral, is provided to parents in native language to ensure effective communication and parent  involvement.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    While we do not have a shared building, we share resources and coordinate efforts with our partner schools.  We have also  concentrated on increasing curricular materials that would enable our ELL students to receive appropriate instruction that  includes both text and technology. Students use a variety of materials to support teaching and learning in themes and content  specific activities. Computer programs developed for the support of ESL students are also used to bolster student ability and  individualize instruction for ELLs. Instructional Materials and support include: rich visuals, maps,  content from around the  world (multi-cultural realia) used to demonstrate and explain concepts that are abstract and difficult to understand, sheltered  English for Science, and Social Studies, graphic organized and scaffolding support, students work in dyads and triads, use of  charts to break down content.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Upon verification of entitlement, parents/guardians of newly enrolled ELLs are informed and invited to an orientation.  At the  orientation, information is given to inform parents of programs available to ELL students, state standards, assessments and  expectations for their children.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs are offered the following language elective at I.S. 364: Spanish       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1.  Staff development will include all teachers in the building.  Teachers will receive professional development designed  to  support the implementation of the Chancellor’s initiatives and regional/school goals for the instruction of ELLs.  Workshops  will be conducted by certified ESL teachers and other specialists.   2. Teachers of ELLs with be part of all monthly professional development activities to better acclamate them to the rigor of the  new Common Core Learning standards.  Weekly teacher team meeting will be conducted as part of the SBO voted on  by teachers to provide additional meeting time to deepen their understanding of the shifts that come with the implementation  of the new standards.  Professional Development is provided for all personnel who work with ELLs, including paraprofessionals,  guidance counselors, psychologists, speech therapists, coaches, secretaries, and the Parent Coordinator. Many of the  strategies that are used with ELL students work equally well with non-ELL students. These include vocabulary development,  emphasis on reading comprehension strategies, development of oral and listening skills, and modeling. Staff is also encouraged  to attend QTEL   training and OELL workshops throughout the year.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  3.           ESL teachers will attend ESL staff development meetings and workshops on a monthly basis.  These meetings will  provide teachers with opportunities to discuss current research, best practices, materials, NYS-ESL standards, NYS-ELA  standards, instructional strategies and alignment to core curriculum and the application of the Core Knowledge prototype.    4.          The ESL teacher supports staff needs including: professional development, best approach methodology, ESL  prototype, data analysis, comprehensive needs assessment, parental involvement, compliance and instructional issues,  preparation for the NYSESLAT and program design. A review of teacher records will be conducted to assess need for the  required 7.5 hour training to staff. For those teachers that must fulfill the training requirement, training will be provided on  site by the ESL teacher and/or the ELL Specialist from the CFN.   The training will be facilitated to staff in the spring. Each  participant will be awarded a certificate of   completion upon completion of the training series.     Monthly ESL/Bilingual teacher professional development facilitated by the BNFSC is made available to all  staff.  Teachers discuss current research, best practices, materials, NYS-ESL standards, instructional strategies and alignment to  core curriculum and the application of Core Knowledge.     A collaborative approach including Inquiry Teams will be part of the training where teachers will focus on instructional  approaches that will articulate into long-range teaching strategies.       Teachers will also be attuned to the variables that affect language learning and instruction:  age, grade, placement,  personality, educational background, level of proficiency in both the native language and English, parental support, needs of  the student and resources available to the teachers.     Staff development will also focus on alternate assessments, stressing assessments that are not totally writing-dependent and  specific strategies which have been successful with ELLs            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   1. Parent involvement at IS 364 includes a variety of workshops on several topics offered throughout the school year. A  monthly calendar of parent workshops and meetings is disseminated monthly to all parents.  ELL parents are invited to an  orientation, if needed, and all other workshops throughout the year. A meeting for ELL parents to discuss the ESL program,  NYSESLAT and any concerns of the parents are scheduled.  Families are also invited to visit their child’s classroom to see the  strategies that are taught to the students during our Curriculum Night event during the last week in September..  ELL parents  are invited to participate class trips, and volunteer to assist with special events.  There are parent meetings which take place  throughout the school year. In September and October there are Orientation meetings for ELL parents to introduce them to  the school, the curriculum and other extracurricular events. All ELL parent workshops promote the development of English  language literacy at home. Translators are avaliable as needed.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Gateway Intermediate School                                                                              School DBN: 19K364  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication.

All parents or guardians of newly enrolled students are required to complete a Home Language Identification  Survey (HLIS). This informs us of the language needs of the parents of English Language Learners. The classroom  teachers, testing coordinator and parent coordinator as well as the ESL teacher work together to make sure the  language needs of our students and their parents are met. All official correspondence is sent home in the parents'  native language. In addition, there is an ELL parent orientation meeting at the beginning of the year to answer any  questions the parents may have. The material is presented in the parent's native language and there is also staff  on hand who speak Haitian Creole and Spanish, the home languages of our ESL community. However, if necessary,  The Translation and Interpretation Unit of the Board of Education will be utilized for interpretation services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60     2.
