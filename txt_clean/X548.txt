This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      At Careers in Sports High School (CISHS) we are preparing our students to interact with the larger world effectively.  We not only focus on the academic skills that students need in order to be successful in life but, we also focus on their  social/emotional development through our sports theme and with the help of our dedicated and caring staff.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We believe that in order to prepare young people for the world at large, we must develop them into leaders who are  able to problem solve, communicate effectively and are resilient.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We have 574 students (Grades 9-12) and 79% of our student population is male. This we believe means we are not  really comparable to other schools of equal size. The challenge for boys to engage in literacy and reading and their  under-representation in college makes our work all the more challenging and, in the end, rewarding.   We are 68% Hispanic, 29% Black and 2% White and our ELL students represent 12% of our overall student numbers.   24% of our students (138) have Special Needs. We have committed to an inclusion model with ICT teachers in all  major subject areas to support these students. We have made a commitment to hire ICT teachers who are dually  certified in special education and in the major subject areas so the conversations around curricula and  accommodations can be fruitful and informative.   We are housed in the Mott Haven Bronx Campus that consists of almost 2,000 students and houses three other high  schools and a charter elementary school. While each school has its own classrooms, large areas like the auditorium,  library and outdoor playing field are shared. In recent months we have also had to share our gym. Sharing space can  sometimes be a challenge but we try to be good neighbors.      Our School-wide Instructional Focus is two-fold:   1. Student-to-Student Interactions   2. Higher Order of Thinking Questions   We are striving to make sure all students are engaging in meaningful and consistent student-to- student interactions.  It is our belief that students learn best when provided with the opportunity to work with their peers. For that reason  there are no rows in our classrooms, everyone sits with a classmate or in groups. Students are expected to work in  teams at least once per class period. When we do observations based on the Danielson Framework, we expect to see  that. It is our expectation that teachers’ lesson plans include the rationale behind grouping and provide differentiated  instruction for students with different needs. The Danielson Framework is the basis for our informal and formal  observations with staff. In addition, we have concentrated on asking higher order thinking questions. Danielson 3B  (questioning and discussion) has helped us to provide more valuable and specific feedback. We believe the quality of  the questions matters. We believe through increasing the complexity of questions and student interaction, all  students will improve their thinking, reading, and writing skills accordingly. Our teachers are making meaningful  changes and strides in revising their curriculum and changing their teaching practices.      Some Special Initiatives:   School-wide Grade Criteria/System  In PDs and in conversations with staff, we asked teachers make sure the  assignments are rigorous and aligned with the curriculum. Administration also asked that assessments not merely be  summative but also formative and given throughout the marking period so teachers and students could be informed  on what students had learned and what needed to be re-taught. Each department has at least a minimum number of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      formative assessments they must all give each marking period Each department has clearly articulate the percentage  value of each assessment and weighted percentage of the summative and formative assignments.      Engrade – a digital grade book/attendance system used by all staff in our school. Engrade allows teachers to publicly  share student performance data. This gives all parties a chance to see student achievement data in real time and  make changes. It gives teachers the ability to see how students are performing in specific classrooms and by grade in  their discipline and they can make the necessary adjustments. The school administrator can also see student  performance through weekly checks and talk to teachers about teaching and learning. Students use this system to  check on and improve their grades by handing in missing / late work. Parents, while still the smallest constituents by  percentage of use, also have access.   Some Partnerships:   College Success Center provides students from the Campus with guidance pertaining to all aspects of college. They  also organize college trips as well as college fairs.   Sponsor for Educational Opportunities (SEO) Program SEO Scholars is a free eight-year academic program that gets  low-income public high school students to and through college–with a 95% college graduation rate.   In high school the program offers intensive year-round academic preparation via a carefully-calibrated, rigorously- assessed course of supplemental education. Their Saturday, summer and weekly after-school classes provide the  equivalent of 2.5+ years of instruction in English and 1.5+ years of instruction in math.   In college they continue to support students through each of their four years, providing one-on-one academic,  personal and career exploration support. At the moment we have 2 9th grade student enrolled in the program.   College Confident A comprehensive college readiness program through the ESI grant that provides CISHS with  Brotherhood Advisory Workshops, peer to peer mentoring groups meeting weekly, the execution of College  Confident’s “Brotherhood” Young Men’s Institute Program for participating students and College Visits including  SUNY, CUNY and Private Colleges.   College Now A challenging academic program for high school juniors and seniors where CISHS students take college  level courses at Hostos Community College. Students can take a variety of classes; from Psychology to College Algebra  with Trigonometric Functions (offered at Lehman College through the College Now program). College Now offers  many activities and opportunities, academic courses, campus-based tours and cultural events, such as theater or  dance performances, and even exclusive scholarship offers. The program is offered to 11th and 12th grade students.   Monroe College Dual Enrolment Program A college credit bearing program for high school juniors and seniors to take  college level courses at CISHS as well as at Monroe College. This program is geared for students to challenge  themselves, enhance learning experiences, prepare them for college level study, and graduate from CISHS with  transferable college classes at no cost to CISHS students or their families.   Fordham Step This is a rigorous pre-college program. Accepted students take college prep courses in math and  science beginning in 9th grade. Students are able to continue to take classes through their senior year in college.  Accepted students have the opportunity to take college level courses over the summer and receive one on one  college counseling.   Generation Citizen Generation Citizen is an organization designed to ensure that every student receives an effective  education in civic action that provides them with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in our democracy  as agents of positive change. Generation Citizen's vision is of young people as activists for social justice collectively  working to rejuvenate our democracy. Through an innovative in-class curriculum and guided outreach to community  leaders, students identify community problems, formulate appropriate policy responses and work with public figures  to advance their policy proposals. Through their authentic experiences, our teens are developing their organization,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      communication and leadership skills in ways that are impossible to achieve in the classroom alone. Generation  Citizen's innovative, action-based program can revive and revolutionize civics education; it is helping to develop youth  activists and future leaders who are not only inspired by the ideals of social justice but who also are equipped to  meaningfully pursue their dreams.   Peer Health Exchange Within their advisories, 9th grade students participate in workshops about sex and  relationships taught by students from Hunter College. This 11 week course educates students on the elements of  healthy relationships, the dangerous of abuse, and the importance of communication and information when making  decisions about starting a sexual relationship.   No Kidding: Straight Talk The No Kidding: Straight Talk from Teen Parents Program is a teen pregnancy prevention  initiative of the New York City Department of Health. This program brings actual teen mothers and fathers into  schools to talk with students about their personal realities of having a child at a young age. The ultimate purpose of  this program is to encourage teens to wait until adulthood to have children.   Healthy Relationships The Healthy Relationships workshop series done by Planned Parenthood NYC, informs teens  about HIV and sexually transmitted infections, birth control and condom use, as well as how to establish healthy  relationships with their partner.   New York Urban League The New York Urban League Absolute Success College Access Program (ASCAP) is a  comprehensive college and career access model that holds college readiness at the center of all our education  services. At our participating institutions, we strive to foster an environment of high expectations and encourage  leadership, academic achievement, and social responsibility. Our curriculum focuses on not only strengthening the  concept of personal development, but also reinforcing academic coursework and relevant lessons learned. This year  at CISHS, we met the challenge by adapting our method of delivery when uniquely placed in an Art course. Through  an amazing partnership with Mr. Alago, we have comprehensively looked at areas for synergy with approaching the  curriculum. Working with freshmen weekly, we have sought to connect their use of creativity, critical thinking, and  understanding of the world around them to yield numerous artistic, writing, and research projects that reflect their  personal and social development.   Urban Dove The College All-Stars is a year-round program designed to help New York City public high school students  make their college dream a reality. The program targets high school sophomores, juniors and seniors, and is designed  to educate them and their families on the entire college application process - from success in high school to obtaining  a degree in the field of their choice. Activities include PSAT/SAT prep, financial aid workshops, college tours, guest  speakers, application help, mentoring sessions and career counseling. Alumni of the program then return to speak to  other Urban Dove students about their college experiences.   Urban Dove Hi-Risers Program - 9th and 10th grade students are invited to be trained as counselors to work with  elementary and middle school students after school. They run sports and tutoring programs. Students commit to  working three days a week, while training and receiving tutoring the other two. Orientations for this program occur  once in September and once in February. Students who successfully complete the program during the year are invited  to work at the Urban Dove Summer Program and attend the Camp Lenox program in Massachusetts over the  summer.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   During the 2017-2018 school year our English Language Learner population has increased by 2%. Many of the ELLs we  are receiving have zero knowledge of English which have led us to program in a more strategic way. Aside from the  service provided by the ENL teacher, whenever possible, these students are programmed into classes where the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      teacher speaks their language. That has helped them with the transition. ELL students represent 12% of our overall  student numbers.   24% of our students (138) have Special Needs. We have committed to an inclusion model with ICT teachers in all  major subject areas to support these students. We have made a commitment to hire ICT teachers who are dually  certified in special education and in the major subject areas so the conversations around curricula and  accommodations can be fruitful and informative.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools' element that we made the most progress over the past year was the one around  Supportive Environment. Thanks to the addition of Single Shepherd counselors, we were able to provide our students  with more individualized and timely guidance.       We are still focusing on deepening our work on Strong Family-Community Ties.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X548   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   515   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Area of celebrations as per spring 2017 PPO visit:    You have ensured that the school’s approach to culture-building, discipline, and social-emotional support considers  the needs of each child, resulting in students being known well by at least one adult. You have put structures in place  that ensure that student voice and leadership are welcomed and valued (i.e. through your student government, the  Teaching Assistant program, etc.). You have ensured that you align professional development, family outreach, and  student learning experiences (through the use of the text Lost at School, etc.). (1.4)   You have ensured your staff consistently communicates expectations that are connected to the path towards  graduation and college readiness (i.e. through college fairs, career day events, college trips, alumni presentations,  Kinvo, etc.). Students are also kept well-informed of their progress along their path (through Kinvo, individualized  meetings with counselors, mailings, the website, Kid Talk conversations, etc.). (3.4)   Areas of Focus / Next Steps      Teachers’ plans and tasks are aligned to the curricula and emphasize CCLS defined skills. Additionally, daily tasks are  emphasizing rigorous habits and higher-order skills (i.e. making inferences, historical analysis, reading and annotating  to make informed hypotheses, etc.). Develop teacher capacity to design lessons that sustain student engagement  independent of the teacher and include differentiated strategies that hold all students accountable for participation in  each portion of the lesson (i.e. during a full-class share-out, etc.). In order to increase teacher confidence in students  being able to work independent of teacher guidance for sustained periods of time, focus teachers on designing highly  structured tasks with clear assessment criteria and accountability. In order to gather data to support you in this work,  consider conducting an administrative walkthrough to gather data on how much time students are spending working  independent of the teacher.(1.1)   Across classrooms, teaching practices are becoming aligned to the school’s instructional focus and other  instructional priorities (i.e. academic student-to-student interactions, classrooms where students take an active role,  etc.). Continue to build teacher capacity to implement strategies that support your instructional focus, ensuring  lessons    During the 2017-2018 Quality Review, our school received a proficient on Indicator 1.2 Pedagogy. Here is what the  quality review found:   Across classrooms, students had structured opportunities to engage in tasks on their own or with their peers to build  critical thinking skills through an intense focus on project-based and problem-based instruction. In some classrooms,  however, tasks are still heavily scaffolded and teacher-directed, hindering student independence, and ownership. For   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      example, in a math class, although the lesson plan stated that students would be given tasks on varying levels of  difficulty to work independently, the teacher dominated the lesson, focusing on one problem. Now, there were few  opportunities for students to turn and talk and to work independently on problems that offer extension into more  academically challenged material. Similarly, in a science class, the warm up lasted longer than necessary, and the  lesson did not strategically provide multiple entry points and high quality supports and extensions into the curricula  for all learners to be cognitively engaged.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our 2016-17 School Quality Guide reveals that 93% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they feel safe in their  classes at their school, 88% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they feel safe in the hallways, bathrooms,  locker rooms, and cafeteria of their school, and 74% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they feel safe traveling  between home and their school; however, in the same School Quality Guide there is an area under Supportive  Environment which indicates that there is a need for growth in social emotional areas as the positive percentile is  below the borough and city average. It is our goal to increase this percentage with the inclusion of adult and peer  mentors, Culturally Responsive Curriculum and varying holistic and progressive approaches.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Our 2018 graduation rate including August 2018 was 57%. Now, we have identified different strategies which have  proven to be successful, we want to raise our graduation rate to 67%.   During the 2016-2017 Quality Review, our school received a developing on Indicator 1.2 –Pedagogy. Here is what the  quality review found:   Across all classrooms, there was evidence of clear learning targets and lesson planning aligned to the workshop  model. In most classrooms, teaching strategies included teachers using and requiring students to use academic  vocabulary, scaffolding techniques and student-choice that is encouraged when choosing a strategy to use. For  example, in math classrooms, students are encouraged to evaluate which strategies are most effective for each of  them to use, which will help them be most successful with the problems they encounter.   Across classrooms, students had structured opportunities to engage in tasks on their own or with their peers to  build critical thinking skills through an intense focus on project-based and problem-based instruction. In some  classrooms, however, tasks are still heavily scaffolded and teacher-directed, hindering student independence, and  ownership. For example, in a math class, although the lesson plan stated that students would be given tasks on  varying levels of difficulty to work independently, the teacher dominated the lesson, focusing on one problem. Now,  there were few opportunities for students to turn and talk and to work independently on problems that offer  extension into more academically challenged material. Similarly, in a science class, the warm up lasted longer than  necessary, and the lesson did not strategically provide multiple entry points and high quality supports and extensions  into the curricula for all learners to be cognitively engaged.   Teachers use Smartboards to display visuals and discuss the content and skills being taught throughout the lesson.  Currently, there is an emphasis on Danielson (3b), Using questioning and discussing techniques to engage all learners  and increase student participation in discussions. Because of this, teachers use questions to guide the class discussion.  In a United States History class, the teacher posed to the class, “Which taxes do you prefer – progressive, regressive  or flat tax?” Students compared regressive, progressive and flat taxes and then debated with each other.

As standards rise, we have a need for our teams to meet and re-visit our curriculums (9-12), to identify areas of  improvement such as: classroom management, developing meaningful assessments, and lesson planning. Students  earning 10 plus credits have been an issue in some of our grades.   During the 2016-2017 Quality Review, our school received a Proficient on Indicator 1.1 –Curriculum. Here is what the  quality review found:   The school uses a uniform school-wide template to create lesson plans that include the New York State content  standards and Common Core Learning Standards. The school’s focus is included with essential questions, materials,  literacy and differentiation strategies, vocabulary, content knowledge, language, and performance skills. Thematic  connections and assessments and reflection activities are specified on lesson plans.  · Curricula maps provide evidence that the school develops rigorous academic tasks through the adaptation of  instructional materials from EngageNY, Common Core Library, and the Science and Social Studies Scope and  Sequence. Most lesson plans included differentiation for students, learning objectives, “do now,” Common Core  Learning Standards, vocabulary, aim, assessment, materials, essential questions, and homework.  · Curriculum planning and refinement take place two to three times a year based on data and authentic student work.  Teachers look at student work regularly to determine students’ understanding, and to evaluate and modify curricula  and academic tasks. Moreover, teacher teams regularly engage with data gathered from assessments to reflect  student growth, as well as, gaps in student learning. For example, on a recent English assessment, students  demonstrated skill deficiencies when engaging with informational texts. English teachers adjusted their instructional  focus to include more informational texts, and to explicitly address Common Core Learning Standards that focused on  vocabulary development and comprehending central ideas. Teacher teams have ensured continued improvement of  the quality of their curriculum planning and mapping with the utilization of peer evaluation of unit plans.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Careers in Sports High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the ESSA is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   This will be our first year as a Community School. Global Kids will be an integral part of our whole school community  as their presence will be felt in the cafeteria, hallways and classroom. We will be doing a need assessment walk- through to identify areas of needs.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.     1.  By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in student attendance (from 78% to 83%).      Global Kids will lead monthly attendance competitions (for students who have achieved 100%, 90-99%, and         students who improve attendance by 10% or more).   Initiation of Student Success Mentoring will provide students with adult mentors to monitor attendance.  Success mentors will receive weekly email to identify students in need of attention, students who have fallen  below attendance goals, and students who have met (or exceeded) their attendance goals.   Families will be notified once students have missed five days. We will call parents, send email, and use  Kinvolved messages. For every additional five days missed, parents will be asked to visit the school or a home  visit will be initiated.             2.  By June 2019, all chronically absent students will be assigned a success mentor and develop positive   attendance plans.      Incoming freshman with attendance falling below 90% will be identified using the Heat Map and targeted for  immediate attendance support.      Global Kids will work with counselors to create positive attendance plans.      Students who show improvement will be acknowledged in monthly attendance celebrations. Families will also  be incentivized and acknowledged to maintain improvement.      Home visits will be initiated when students do not meet weekly attendance goals.    3.   In collaboration with the Campus Success Center, Global Kids will support juniors and seniors develop college  and career goals. In particular, Global Kids will support students at risk of being retained or behind in course  credits in order to promote on-time graduation and the development of post-secondary plans.      Work with counselors to identify juniors and seniors in need of support and identify areas in which additional   services would be beneficial.     Provide teachers with per-session pay to provide tutoring for identified students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      4.  By June 2019, at least ¼ of the families at Careers in Sports will participate in one of the following :   schoolwide activities, community school team meetings, volunteer opportunities, parent-teacher  conferences, etc.     Provide advance notice of monthly opportunities for families to participate in.    Use Kinvolved to open lines of communications between families and school.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Global Kids will work with Careers in Sports staff to facilitate lunch clubs related to specific areas of social and  emotional growth among students. There are a significant number of activities which occur after school so Global Kids  will work with administrators and leaders of community-based organizations within the school to coordinate the  activities and make sure they run smoothly.       Global Kids will also attend weekly attendance meetings and work with counselors and attendance teacher to  increase daily attendance and attendance for students who are chronically absent.       In order to achieve our family engagement goals, Global Kids will partner with the parent coordinator, counselors, and  others to build rapport with parents, create a community culture around family engagement, and provide a diverse  array of opportunities for families to become involved.       Global Kids will also hire a social worker to support work around substance abuse among students and lead groups.  The Global Kids social worker will work with counselors to identify students who are appropriate for group counseling  and help those students meet their therapeutic goals.

Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students.

In this programs, our ESL teacher (DeForest Westry) teams up  with our ELA  teachers to better support and help develop the literacy skills of our ELLs.   Mr.  Westry meets with English teachers on Wednesdays  from 10:00 to 10:45 and with Math and  Science teachers on Tuesdays from 12;24 to 1:09. For grades 9-12, the school is using literacy,  reading and writing skills by holding afterschool programs Tuesday through Thursday, 2:50 pm -  3:50 pm. The Principal's Academy is held on Saturdays, from 9 am to 12 noon. In this  afterschool program, our teachers  work closely with the ELL population to ensure that they are  learning the development skills needed to improve their ELA skills. The teachers will work  closely with the ELL students in small groups in the selected subject areas. The teachers use  informational texts, bilingual dictionaries, and educational software material, in addition to other  instructional materials. This will allow high academic impact with all groups of ELL students  (beginners, intermediate and advanced students). As materials in the classroom, these will be  used in the Title III program which is taught English.  ESL teacher will co-teach with an ELA  teacher in the After School Program and with a Social Studies teacher in the Saturday  Academy.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teachers have their own in-house assessments to determine the proficiency level of each one of our students.  As a school, we  are also able to see where they are at through assessments and programs such as NewsEla.  Thirteen of our  ELLs are at  the Entering level. These thirteen students mainly struggle with the writing process and speaking.  Our teachers are instructed  to provide students with materials both in English and the student's home language.  Most of our ELLs (86) choose English over  any other language.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         General education teachers are provided time to co-plan with the ENL teacher, Mr. Westry. Textbooks and books are  purchased in students' home language. Students are provided with Ipads or laptops to use in their classes.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Upon student arrival, student is given the NYSITELL (if they are entering NYC Dept. of Ed. for the first time). We also look into  their class,  NYSESLAT and Regents performance.    We are finding that a lot of our ELL students are mainly struggling with  reading and writing.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students are programmed according to their levels and need. We have a stand alone ENL class as well as a push-in approach.  Students are for the most part scheduled together into the same block to provide them with the opportunity to support each  other.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers use the data to group students based on academic level. It also allow us to see which students need additional push- in assistance and extra support (e.g., after school and lunch period study group).      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the EDAT report, it seems like the reading and writing components of the exam are the toughest sections for  students (only seven students scored high in the writing modality and three in the reading modality).  Based on their regents  and class grade, students are also struggling with mathematical skills. Whenever we have to administer the NYSITELL, it is  found that the student needs ENL services.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The findings generated by the data is provided to the school programmer to make sure students are scheduled appropriately.  This information is also shared with the ENL teacher who then disseminate the information with the teachers to meet  students' needs.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our Freestanding ENL program consists of a standalone ENL class taught one period a day (45 minutes) and integrated  ENL, where Mr. Westry (ENL Teacher) pushes in the ELA and History classes. He is required to assists all ELL students  and use the co-teaching approach. We provide these services to all ELL students depending on their proficiency level.       b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   -Entering level students are receiving a minimum of 180 minutes of standalone ENL and a minimum of 180 minutes of  integrated ENL, a minimum of 180 minutes of flexibility that consist of standalone or integrated ENL.  -Emerging level students are receiving a minimum of 90 minutes of standalone ENL and a minimum of 180 minutes of  integrated ENL.  -Transitioning level students receives a minimum of 90 minutes of standalone ENL or integrated ENL. We adjust this based on  each student depending on what works better with their schedule.  -Expanding level students receives a minimum of 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  -Commanding level students receives a minimum of 90 minutes of integrated ENL        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are delivered in the English language.  Our ENL meets with the rest of the staff members and provides them  with updates in terms of each of our ELLs.  The ENL teacher also co-plans with his colleagues in order to differentiate the ELL's  instruction.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    We ordered standardized test in their native language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status         a. We currently have about two students that are SIFE.Our school will provide all the resources necessary to make sure that  their needs are met.  Resources such as individual tutoring, buddy system, before and after school programs, differentiated  instruction and proficiency level software will be made available to all students.       b. In our school we will accommodate newcomers.  We are a school who currently offer ENL classes based on parents'  choice.  All our ELLs will benefit from tutoring, a buddy system, before and after school programs, differentiated instruction  and softwares.         c.  All of our students who have been receiving ENL for 4 to six years are provided with the services needed.  We use in- school assesments as well as the NYSESLAT results to identified the area they need help with.  Once we know their  weaknesses, it is easier for eveyone to help them out.  All these students are scheduled into an ENL class and in some of their  cases, our ESL teacher goes and serves as a co-teacher in some of their main courses.       d.  Our Long-Term ELLs will received all services mentioned above, plus different academic interventions.  This population  tends to drop out of school and that is why counseling and constant dialogues with students, their family and teachers will be  taking place.       e.  Former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL and testing accommodations.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Mr. Westry uses Spanish-English dictionaries, books on tape, the use of common sight words and different interactive websites  that focuses on language acquisition.  Material use are grade and age appropriate.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL and SWD students receive push-in intruction as well as individualized instruction while following an inclusion  model.  Many of our staff are bilingual and are able to provide additional classroom support.  Additional periods of ENL  support above and beyond   traditional classroom instruction. SWD received services mandated on their IEPs.  ICT classes, resource room, etc.                    8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Every teacher in our school is aware of the fact that they need to work with our ENL teacher to modify the instruction given to  our ELLs.  As stated before, our ENL teacher goes into main subject classes (English, Social Studies, Math and Science) and  provides support to our ELLs population.  Those students also receive support from bilingual classmates.  The classroom  teachers identified hard working bilingual students and sat them next to our ELLs.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new program or improvements are being considered for the upcoming school year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No program will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELL population is invited (mailings, orientations, etc) to participate in every single one of the programs offered during and  after school hours.  We have organized team sports, internships, community service, after school tutoring as well as after  school and Saturday school classes among many other programs.  All of our students, without any exception, is able to benefit  from these  programs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Some of the instructional materials used in the ENL class are:  Hit the Ground Running:  Exploring Idioms in English           Options Publishing  Comprehensive Reading Assessment                   Options Publishing  Finding the Main Idea                         McDonald  Practical Grammar Activities                     McDonald  Building Vocabulary                         McDonald  Study Skills: Book A&B                                  McDonald  Visions: Language, Literature, Content                 Thomson-Heinle  Reading Skills                             Instructional Fair                                                              Language Practice                         Steck Vaughn  Comprehension: Skills                         Steck Vaughn    All of our classrooms are equipped with smart boards which can be used for interactive lessons.  Every teacher has access to  laptops and desktops for students' use.  Our ESL teacher also meets with the main subject teaches and provide them with  material relevant to their classes which they can provide to our ESL population.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All of our students are required to one year of a foreign language.  In our school that foreign language is Spanish.  All of our  ELLs take Spanish classes and are able to further develop their native language.  They also benefit from the fact that more than  half of our staff members speak Spanish.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         All teachers look at the proficiency level, age and grade of each student and based on that determine the services and support  needed.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Some of the instructional materials used in the ESL class are:  Hit the Ground Running:  Exploring Idioms in English           Options Publishing  Comprehensive Reading Assessment                   Options Publishing  Finding the Main Idea                         McDonald  Practical Grammar Activities                     McDonald  Building Vocabulary                         McDonald  Study Skills: Book A&B                                  McDonald  Visions: Language, Literature, Content                 Thomson-Heinle  Reading Skills                             Instructional Fair                                                              Language Practice                         Steck Vaughn  Comprehension: Skills                         Steck Vaughn    All of our classrooms are equipped with smart boards which can be used for interactive lessons.  Every teacher has access to  laptops and desktops for students' use.  Our ESL teacher also meets with the main subject teaches and provide them with  material relevant to their classes which they can provide to our ESL population.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All of our ELL's and their families are invited to come into an open house (late August) where services and support systems are  explained to all of them.  This allows those students the opportunity to meet their teachers before hand.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer any language elective, but we do offer a one year of Spanish.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   Over the course of the school year 2017-2018, our English, ENL teacher, will conduct a series of 4 workshops focusing on how  staff can adapt their methodology to best meet the needs of ELL students. This workshop is present to ALL staff members.     WORKSHOP 1: They will ensure that a list of the names of all students classified as ELL learners is distributed to the staff at the  beginning of the fall term.  The committee will lead an introductory to ELL workshop for the staff as a whole.  Within this  workshop, they will outline the rights/needs of ELL students.  They will make clear that ELL is not considered a learning  disability and that being an ELL student does not reflect upon a student’s intelligence or potential.  This is an important point  to understand because sometimes ELL students see any help offered to them as a slight and are resistant to seek the additional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         support to which they are entitled. They will also outline a basic list of ways that a teacher can support ELL students within the  classroom.     WORKSHOP 2:  This workshop will be conducted through a discussion on the progress that teachers have noticed being made  by ELL learners within their classrooms.  Teachers should bring examples of student work.  Teachers will discuss difficulties that  they are having in reaching ELL students and brainstorm ways that they can improve their relationships. They will also discuss  the one to one instruction with these particular students within their classrooms.  Our English teacher, who will supply  published materials to support these discussions, will facilitate this workshop.     WORKSHOP 3: This workshop will be an investigation of what it feels like to be an ELL student.  Our English teacher will  conduct the workshop as a class in which she is the teacher and the staff is the students.  Our English teacher will teach the  class in a foreign language, with the full expectation that the students will understand everything that she says and will be  penalized for not being able to follow the class.  This exercise will be followed with a discussion of what it felt like to be the  students and what it felt like to be the teacher.     WORKSHOP 4: This workshop will be a follow up on the progress made by ELL students throughout the year.  It will also focus  on ELL students and the Regents exams.  Teachers will have a chance to reflect on themselves as practitioners and how they  can improve for the following year.      During weekly meetings, teachers and staff members discuss different issues concerning students.  Everyone is informed of the  academic and social status of each individual student in order to collectively determine how to get better results from each  student.  The ELL teacher shares with the rest of the staff improvements being made by the ELL students. The teachers then  respond with any improvements they have noticed in their own classes and suggestions they may have for helping ELL  students do better.       It is extremely important for a teacher to know the performance level of each one of his/her students and to see how their  students are performing in other classes.  This is an opportunity that our weekly meetings provide our staff members.  There  they can discuss different strategies that will, in the short and long run, help each one of our students.  Aside from our weekly meetings, the ELL teacher, as well as the rest of the staff attends different regional meetings and  workshops offered by the Office of English Language Learners to gather more information on how to best serve our students.  We will also organize more workshops where people from our network come to our school and talk to all our teachers about  ELLs.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Mr. Westry, ENL teacher, attends ENL CTLEs provided by the Borough Office . The information from those CTLEs is turnkey to  the staff at our weekly professional development (PD) meetings by Mr. Westry (with administration's support)  All staff  members participate in in this weekly PD meetings. In a year, we have approximately twenty PD's (1 hour and 15 minutes each  ) of which five of them are pertaining to ELLs. Those five ELLs meeting are presented by Mr. Westry, our certified ENL  teacher.  It is an expectation that all our teachers will implement the methodologies, strategies and suggestions given in this  meetings. Agendas and minutes are kept on file by the Principal's secretary.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELLs need to be informed of the programs offered at the school and that is why at the beginning of the semester in  September we have orientation sessions for parents of newly enrolled/identified ELL students.  At this orientation we explain  all three program choices to all parents in attendance.  There we let every parent know about the services we can offer their  children.  For instance, if their children are newcomers, they will receive all the support necessary to be successful in  school.  The same programs are offered to long term ELLs and those students with special needs will be offered what is stated  on their IEPs.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Aside from orientation and workshops involving ELL Parents, we invite them to our school-wide celebrations and our PTA  meetings.  About 40% of our ELL parents are active participants at these events.  Our Parent Coordinator (Mr. Santana) is  key.  He makes calls and does mailings (using parents preferred language) to invite families to these events.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Johanny Garcia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Careers in Sports High School                                                                              School DBN: 07x548  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      As part of the admission process, parents are interviewed to complete the Home Language Identification survey  (HLIS). This information is used to determine parents’ preferred language of communication. Our Pupil Personal  Secretary generates the ATS RAPL report and request the RCPL report to identify the language preference of our  parents. With the help of the parent coordinator and Pupil Personal Secretary we also rely on the Emergency  Contact Cards to update information.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
