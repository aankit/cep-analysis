This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission at PS 206, is to prepare every student for college and career readiness in a stimulating, challenging, safe  environment with high standards and current technology. We are committed to helping children become creative  thinkers, lifelong achievers, and well-rounded citizens. PS 206 fosters a collaborative approach where students,  teachers, staff, parents, administrators, and community leaders work together in partnerships to support the student  learning community.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 206, has approximately 1500 students in grades K through 8 th grade. One of our greatest achievements is our  teacher collaboration which has resulted in a comprehensive curriculum designed by teachers for teachers. This  cohesive curriculum has guided teachers to impacting positive student outcomes. Staff members work together in a  warm and nurturing environment where students thrive. We are committed to giving students opportunities to be  heard. Students’ voices are an important part of our school culture and we collaborate to assist students both socially  and emotionally. We have created individual programming for out middle school students, added Sanford Harmony  Character Development program and staff has been trained in Restorative Circles to address the social emotional  growth off all students in the school.    We are proud to say that we have eight certified arts teachers in the areas of dance, music, theatre and visual arts.  This has enabled our students to have multiple years of arts study which will enable them to further develop and  enhance their skills in the arts. We also have a school band which increases in size each year. Performances allow  parents to see students’ talents and encourage an increase of engagement between the home and school. This year,  we had our first ever Evening with the Arts where we were able to integrate all disciplines with multiple time periods  into a spectacular show for our community. We offer enrichment activities in all the arts both during the school day  and after school.    Some of the other highlights of the school include:    In response to the Chancellor’s vision of a deepening parent engagement, we continue to have an open house each  month followed by a workshop to parents on a topic that is relevant to their children. This year the parent groups will  be choosing the topic, presenting and developing the workshops for parent workshops. There are many parent events  throughout the school year for parents and students including dances, family nights, workshops, ELL Fridays and  Saturdays.     In response to student needs, the school has integrated enrichment into student schedules throughout the grades.  Students are given opportunities to choose their own enrichment activities. The school has also implemented  individual programming in the middle school and teachers have developed the cluster schedule based on the needs of  the students.     Parent communication and student communication integrate technology through the use of Skedula, blogs and exit  tickets online. The school has also integrated days of code on all grades. There are several teacher professional  development partnerships in the areas of STEM and STEAM. The school is also working with Urban Advantage  partnership in Science in the middle school.    We have Student Government Organizations for both elementary and middle school. These students have the  opportunity to discuss student issues and recommend school changes that impact their quality of instruction. We  have developed a debate club and law program alongside our development of our student government. . The law club  also participates in mock trials in our developing partnership with Madison High School.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.

Every year we review all data sources including pre and post assessments, performance series, item analysis, running  records, and classroom observations to find trends and patterns in our school wide progress. We are making progress  however the progress is not consistent across all grades, subject areas and progress in all sub groups. We also have  added many new staff members to the school and the student population as increased along with the number of  English Language Learners and students with IEPs. State Scores indicate that we are make steady movement in ELA  while we have a rise in scores in the 2017-18 school year, our math scores increased in third and sixth grade while the  other grades have demonstrated slight decreases and a basic flat line in scores. We are also offering Regents Math  exams to more eighth graders and as result we need to analyze and revise our eighth grade curriculum.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Assessment is embedded in all unit plans and lesson plans however the assessment often is not timely meaning that  by the time all the students are assessed the data is already outdated and not meeting the current needs of the  students in the classroom. There is a clear need for quick assessments that provide teachers with the evidence of  student current knowledge and need. These quick assessments can then be used to immediately inform and revise  instruction as needed in the classroom. There is also an inconsistency in assessment results across the core subject  areas.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, there will be a 10 percent increase in student performance from pre to post assessment based on  effective targeted assessments that assess the ongoing needs of all students in the school with ongoing revision as  needed.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Trends in our parent environment survey and in house school survey indicated the desire of parents to be more fully  involved in the academic progress of their children. One of the indications was that some parents were still unclear of  the expectations of the Common Core Learning Standards. We traditionally hold a monthly open house, followed by a  workshop targeting a particular interest of parents. These opportunities for parent engagement were met with great  enthusiasm, but there was limited turnout of new parents who were not proficient in English, even though we offered  simultaneous translations. Our Parents’ Association began to offer more opportunities for translation on a daily basis  and we saw our parent involvement increase. One of the most immediate ways that we were able to have constant  interaction with parents was our ability to create an email distribution list on a class, grade, and school wide level.  Additionally, we used Title III funds in order to promote English proficiency for parents.   Parent engagement has increased in the school, parents are ready to take a more active role in meeting directly with  teachers on a joint advisory board.

High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   We have implemented many structures to solidify our Professional Learning Community:   ● Professional Learning Groups- Teachers joined study groups based on their interests. They considered aspects of  their teaching they would like to further develop. Student work is reviewed regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of  the learning and how it impacts students. Study groups have three annual cycles that are turn-keyed to the entire  community at the end of the cycle.    ● Lateral Planning Time- All grades have multiple collaborative preparation periods each week to communicate best  practices, analyze data, and plan for implementation.    ● Teacher Teams- Our teams work together to design instruction that increases student outcomes. We design push-in  models for service providers and ENL teachers. The administrative team constantly monitors these teams ability to  work effectively and efficiently through observations, walk-throughs, and conversations.    ● Mentoring- Experienced mentors work with new teachers, observe lessons, model effective teaching practices, and  co-teach with the first year teacher in an effort to assist them in enhancing their skills.    ● Professional Development - Staff members attend professional development workshops and turn-key their learning.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      ● School Leadership Team -Our school leadership team is an extension of our teacher teams and includes  administration, parents, and teachers. We work collaboratively to ensure all decisions are made in an effort to raise  the level of student achievement.    ● Peer Leadership - Administrators schedule intervisitations to reach a wide variety of teachers and grade levels. We  discuss our findings and identify teachers who have expertise to share and should be supported as leaders. We  encourage inter-visitation in classrooms where teachers have demonstrated motivation and strengths in specific  areas.   ● Each grade also has a teacher leader willing to establish grade goals and how to achieve them.    ● Instructional Team – Due to budget cuts, it has been difficult to maintain an extended instructional team that  includes various constituents. Presently our instructional team includes administrators, our literacy coach, guidance  counselors, our IEP teacher, and an ESL teacher. We have successfully made attempts to include teachers that are  pursuing their administrative degrees and value their input since it brings various perspectives.

Parents will be invited to share their individual needs with school staff by inviting new parents to current parent  events and workshops.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33       4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     PS/IS 206 has a UFT liaison team that meets monthly to discuss structures and policy for all decision making including  assessments. Teachers have created portfolio templates and assessments to go with them in for both pre and post  assessments. These assessments are shared on google docs with all of our school curriculum. With respect to  mandated assessments, we also meet to discuss what works best for our students and school. We want assessments  to drive instruction, not to replace it. We teach test taking strategies but do not teach test preparation.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       PS/IS 206 Parent Involvement Policy and School Parent Compact    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s various programs. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent  Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.

All ELLs eligible for ENL services will receive their mandated CR Part 154 ESL  instruction  during the school day. ELL Enrichment program will be in addition to their mandated programs.  The ELL enrichment program was developed and implemented over the past two school years  and was very successful not only in  developing language skills for our ELL students but also for our parents. By inviting parents to  the program, the  language skills of the parents were also developed as one ENL certified teacher taught a  beginner’s  course to adults.  The program was formulated based on the needs of our students to develop their vocabulary in  all content areas. Prior to formulating the concept for ELL Enrichment, academic data, informal  observations, and conversations with classroom teachers were carefully used to formulate a  curriculum  that best addresses the needs of our school’s ELL population. Data has shown ELL students  engage  positively with the Arts and enrichment: they are willing to take risks in enrichment activities  that focus  on their interests and strengths rather than their academic needs. English Language Learners who  infrequently express themselves in a regular classroom setting are often responsive to an Arts  focused  environment as they work with a group.  Our academic data shows weakness throughout the ELL population in terms of acquisition of  academic language, vocabulary usage, and literary comprehension. This is also part of our  Instructional  Focus this year. Based on this data, we have created a program that builds on students’ joy and  comfort  with the Arts and Enrichment activities; including but not limited to song, dance,painting,  cooking, sports and acting. We plan on implementing the Title III program, ELL Enrichment, to  facilitate  high level learning through engagement and the Arts.  The school’s English Language Learner Enrichment program will include students in grades K-8  and will take place in the Fall and Spring of 2018-19. All ELLs will be offered a seat in this  program and  classes will be set up based on parent and student response.  Goals/Objectives:  Our primary goals are to improve both cognitive academic language proficiency and basic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   interpersonal communication skills in ELL students through the Arts and Enrichment. Other  goals  include encouraging academic risk taking and increasing comprehension in all four modalities;  listening,  speaking, reading, and writing. All after school activities will be aligned to the CCLS and the  Blueprint for  the Arts. Instruction will be differentiated according to students’ needs. Learning will include all  four  modalities of English acquisition; listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Students will be  expected to    create a product based on a chosen theme and present their work to the group.  STRUCTURE  Students will be grouped by grade level and assigned to an ENL teacher and/or common branch  teachers, and teaching assistant to work with the group. They will participate in activities that  will  address the needs of all levels of learners, through movement, games, and art.  SUBGROUPS AND GRADE LEVELS  All ELL students from grades K-8 at all levels.  Parents and family members of ELL students who are interested in developing their English  language  skills.  SCHEDULE AND DURATION:  The Fall and Spring sessions will include grades K-8. All classes will meet on Wednesday and  Friday  at 2:30pm-4:30pm Beginning in November through June.  Parents will be invited to participate in the After School program as well.  NUMBER AND TYPES OF TEACHERS  Teachers: 5 certified ENL teachers and 1 arts teacher working collaboratively with 10 common  branch  teachers and 7 teaching assistants.

Because  our teachers have had a great deal of training in curriculum development and performance  assessments, time will be devoted for them to construct a curriculum that integrates the CCLS,  Blueprint  for the Arts and English Acquisition under the guidance of our ENL teachers and administration.  Teachers will attend citywide and borough wide trainings that focus on the Arts, ESL  methodology,  language development and family engagement. The teachers will also plan collaboratively along  with  the teaching assistants to plan activities to increase student engagement and to build the  speaking,  writing and vocabulary skills of all students. There will also will be workshops for parents in  language  development, homework assistance and other workshops based on needs assessments completed  by  the parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The formative assessments used by our school to guide instructional planning for ELLs in Grades K-5  are Fountas and Pinnell  for reading and Eureka/Engage New York for math. In addition, students in grades K-8 are given the Performance Tasks Series  which measures their growth in ELA and math. In grades K-5, the reading assessments are given in September, January, and  May.  Math assessments are given prior to and after the completion of each module. For writing, students complete an on  demand and post-assessment for each unit according to the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP)  curriculum. In addition, students complete a pre and post assessment portfolio piece per unit in all content areas.  Schoolwide,  students participate in Mathletics which allows them to self-assess their skills in math. This also informs their teachers about  their progress as well as academic needs. NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores from the previous year are analyzed to drive instruction  and place students in appropriate and flexible learning groups.  In grades 6-8,  students follow individualized schedules which   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      place them in classes according to their scores from the previous year’s ELA and Math tests. Middle school students complete  a pre and post assessment for each math unit. In ELA, middle school students follow the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing  Project (TCRWP). Students complete an on demand writing assignment prior to each writing unit as well as a post assessment  after each unit.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support planning for our ELLs, teachers meet weekly to implement and revise structures and curriculum currently in place.  This in an ongoing process in which ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to implement structures to best support  our ELLs.  Students are provided with materials to support their learning in all classrooms. For example, ELLs in grades K-5 are  provided with an “I Can Read” Binder. This binder contains scaffolds needed to foster their independence and new language  acquisition such as: sight words, days of the week, vocabulary list, content based supports with visuals, anchor charts, and  modified texts.  In grades 6-8, students have an ENL binder to support them in content area learning as well as their language  acquisition. Students are provided with leveled scaffolds  to support their independence in all classes. In addition, the  leadership team looks at the areas where the students are performing above and below standards to provide additional  supports and professional development.  Teachers are given planning time to collaborate and share ideas, strategies and  supports for our ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We look at the data from the NYISTELL, NYSESLAT, results of the New York State ELA, Math, and Science  assessments.  Teachers use daily conference notes, checklists (both teacher and student made, as well as student work with  rubrics to identify progress and areas of need.  Fountas and Pinnell assessments, baseline and benchmark unit assessments,  performance tasks are also analyzed to discover student progress.  Additionally, students complete portfolio work and projects  in all subject areas.  Many of these assessments are ongoing such as running records, portfolio projects, and conference  notes.  Data spreadsheets are created monthly and contain current reading levels and conference notes which inform us how  much progress our ELLs are making, as well as areas of need.           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered, the following structures are in place to ensure that students’ needs are met: After  school ENL opportunities are offered including art club, cooking club, origami club, imaginative play, theater, and literacy  centers.  A partnership between the older students and the younger students is established to support struggling readers.  Upper elementary students will come at their lunch hour to read with lower grade students and to go over sight words and  reading strategies.  During lunch, teachers offer extra tutoring for students in need.  ENL teachers are given flexibility to to  provide support in a variety of ways depending on the needs of the students. For example, co-teaching with the classroom  teacher, parallel teaching, small-group instruction, and stand alone ENL services.  Summer school enrichment is offered to all  ELLs to ensure their continued language acquisition over the summer months.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   .             The data provided from assessments in the classroom informs us of the current performance of ELLs as well as their progress  in their literacy and math skills.  When the data indicates that our current ELLs are scoring at a significantly lower level than  our non-ELLs, a committee consisting of the principal, assistant principal/special education supervisor, the school psychologist,  the school social worker, occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech providers, ENL teachers, SAPIS counselor, guidance  counselor, AIS/SETSS/IEP teacher, and classroom teachers meets to discuss ways to intervene.  The results from assessments  are also used to assess the need for Tier Two and Tier Three interventions.    RTI interventions go as follows: Tier 1 –Intervention in the classroom- Adjustments to the classroom setting, teaching  methods, or teacher support from an ENL teacher are used at this level. Students can be placed in small groups, they can  receive peer tutoring, they may participate in guided reading groups, and they may have multiple entry points to help them   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         progress using targeted technology (chromebooks, iPads). Teachers will differentiate instruction to reach all learners. Tier 2 -  intervention in addition to the classroom intervention is given twice a week for fifty minutes each day in groups of four to six  students. In grades K-2, additional instruction is provided by an AIS teacher.  State test scores, local assessments and  classroom assessments are used to determine student needs of tier 2 interventions. Programs include Wilson, Fundations, and  guided reading are used Tier 2- Intervention in addition to the classroom intervention. In order for students to move from Tier  1 to Tier2 and above, teachers must present the students to the School Implementation Team. All students including ELLs must  complete Tier 1 through Tier 3 services before moving to the special education services.  PS 206 has Arabic, Chinese, Russian  and Spanish speaking staff including teachers and paraprofessionals who assist in determining the need of services for  students.  ELL Students that are referred for special education services are evaluated in their native language.                 6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our ELL programs are determined by a variety of factors such as NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math scores. Based on this data in K-5,  our ELLs are placed in heterogeneous classrooms to foster inclusiveness with their peers and language acquisition. ENL  teachers use the NYSESLAT scores to create their instructional small groups. In middle school, students’ state test scores as  well as NYSESLAT scores are used to create individualized programs for each student. Students who excel in math may be  placed in an advanced math class, and students who need support in ELA are placed in a class to support their needs.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teacher teams look at data across grade levels and make adjustments to curriculum as necessary to support our ELLs. For  example, teachers are currently working on aligning content area units to our ELA reading and writing units to make learning  more meaningful for all students. Additionally, we have departmentalized fifth and fourth grade and have individualized  scheduling in middle school.  This allows students to receive higher quality instruction in all areas. ENL teachers analyze the  NYSESLAT scores by modality and proficiency level to create small groups based on students needs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered through either integrated or stand-alone models. Students are heterogeneously grouped in  their classes with a mix of ELLs, FELLs, and Non-ELLs. All Entering and Emerging students are placed in ENL groups- according to grade level-or grade bands (kindergarten, grade 1-2, grade 3-4, and grade 5).  Entering students receive  360 minutes of ENL instruction. 180 of these minutes are integrated and 180 minutes are stand-alone. Emerging  students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction: 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL, 180 integrated ENL, and 90 minutes  of flexible ENL instruction. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction; 90 minutes are integrated  and 90 minutes are flexible. Expanding students receive 180 integrated minutes of ENL instruction. Commanding  students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction.                  Our Freestanding ENL Program is a rigorous, systematic program of English language instruction using second  language acquisition methodologies such as: The Natural Approach, providing access to content area instruction  through the use of various instructional supports, e.g., scaffolding (modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema  building, graphic organizers, questioning, text re-presentation, metacognition and working in cooperative groups) the  Balanced Literacy model, and thematic units of study. .  New York State regulations determine how many units of ENL instruction each student receives according to his or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         her English proficiency level on the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test.  All ELLs participate and are afforded equal access to all school programs including the general education and special  education programs.                   All ELLs are expected to engage in their daily lessons and participate in activities that are fully aligned to the  Common Core Learning Standards. Our entire ENL program features high quality instructional practices that assist in  the academic development and achievement of ELLs.  All ELLs participate in a comprehensive approach to Balanced  Literacy and Math.  The Balanced Literacy components include: Think-Aloud, Read Aloud, Accountable Talk, Shared  Reading/Writing, Guided Reading/Writing, and Independent Reading/Writing. All ELLs are placed in print rich  classrooms with leveled libraries.                  Teachers provide instruction to engage ELL students in rigorous academic activities that promote conceptual  and linguistic development in all disciplinary areas such as science, social studies, the arts, physical education and  technology to achieve college and career readiness skills.    In Math teachers utilize the Engage NY Math  using manipulatives, technology and the workshop model.          b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                  c.  DL program.  If applicable.        The 2018-2019 school year will be the Second  year we will be offering a Russian dual language program with a  kindergartn and first grade class.  The program will be a self-contained classroom that will be half day in English and  Half day in Russian (50/50)  The class will be made up of 50% of Russian native speaking ENL students, and 50% of  non-ENL students.  The program will be implemented as such: reading, fundations, and writing will be taught in  English only.  Shared reading, read alouds, social studies and some math will be taught in Russian and English. We  have also order Passport to Social Studies Russian editions for the 2018-19 school year.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                As per CR Part 154, our staff is organized to ensure that all students receive at least the minimum mandated number of  instructional minutes according to their NYSESLAT proficiency level. In order to do this, before school starts, the ENL staff and  the administration looks at the NYSESLAT data and groups the students by grade level and proficiency level. We then add in all  the new admits and transfer students within the first 10 days of enrollment. We ensure all students are identified by running  the RLAT in ATS. This report gives us the scores on the NYSESLAT so we can verify that all students are put on the entitled list  to be serviced. The number of students and periods will be determined when we receive NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results..     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In freestanding ENL and Dual Language, students are taught core content in a variety of ways to make it comprehensible to  all learners. ELL receive content areas instruction in alignment with the units of study and curriculum of their current grade  level. Students are provided with a variety of supports including visuals, realia, bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, leveled texts,  word banks, conversation and writing prompts, and technology. Scaffolds may be added or removed according to the needs of  the students. The goal is to foster independence, so when a student no longer needs a scaffold, it is removed.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Once the students are assessed through the NYSITELL, Spanish speaking students are evaluated in Spanish through the Spanish  LAB.  Throughout the year the students receive translated versions of tests as needed and where there is not written  translation, oral translation is used.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    There are numerous ways we differentiate for our ELLs on a daily basis.  Many factors are taken into consideration when  teachers plan for their ELLs.  Their proficiency level, the amount of time they have been in the country, whether they have had  any interrupted education, and their literary level in their native language all come into play.    A.   According to CR Part 154, a Student with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) is defined as students who: come from a  home in which a language other than English is spoken and enter a school in the US after grade 2; or are immigrant students  and enter a school in the US after grade 2 have had at least two years less schooling than their peers; function at least two  years below expected grade level in reading and mathematics; and, may be pre-literate in their first language) or in the  scenario where a student returns to his native country and attends school with no English language instruction and then  comes back to our school, attention must be given to address the learning gaps in his/her instruction.  Our instructional plan  for the situation where we have SIFE students is made in conjunction with the parents, ESL staff, the administration, the  classroom teacher(s), AIS teacher, and guidance counselor.    SIFE students need intensive special support and assistance.  Whenever available, SIFE students are placed in the ICT class to have the benefit of having two teachers and often a  paraprofessional as well to provide extra support.  After taking everything into account, one option is to place the student in a  lower grade.  This is done on a case by case basis and with informed parental consent.  When placing the student in a lower  grade is not an option, instruction will be accommodated by providing an extra period of ENL daily, as needed, in addition to  the mandated unit as per CR Part 154 regulations, providing academic intervention services from our AIS teacher, providing  counseling services by the guidance counselor, attending the extended day program for small group instruction based on  assessed needs, attending after-school reading/math programs to improve literacy and math skills, attending our ENL Title III  after-school program and providing access to computer assisted language learning programs.     B.     At PS 206 we are constantly differentiating instruction for all our ELL subgroups.   Newcomers are students who have recently immigrated and have very limited English language skills. They are at the Pre- Production stage of Second Language Acquisition. Instruction is modified for newcomers by focusing on building vocabulary,  developing listening comprehension, modeling reading and writing, using visuals, realia, and providing active contextualized  engagement activities.  A combination of different second language acquisition strategies (The Natural Approach, TPR,  scaffolding) are used to introduce the students to school routines and basic English language skills. At this stage, teachers may  utilize the student’s native language to ensure the students’ understanding of content area subjects while the student is  acquiring English.  We also have available bilingual picture dictionaries on CDs in many of the languages spoken at our school.  Students have access to many computer programs and subscriptions to assist in their language acquisition such as RazKids,  MyOn, Reading A-Z, and BrainPop and BrainPopJr.  We also have a collection of bilingual/native language reading books in the  school library that all students can check out to read during the reading block or to take home.     Some strategies employed to support our newcomers are:  •             modeling reading and writing through read aloud and think aloud  •             pairing beginners with a more dominant English speaker who can guide and support them while also modeling grade  level appropriate language. Students may also be paired with speakers of their native language to offer comprehension  support.  •             providing cooperative group activities that beginners can participate in by performing tasks such as listing, labeling,  categorizing, responding and answering questions  •             supporting shared reading and writing with visuals  •             participating in shared experiences such as trips, neighborhood walks, and shows  •             planning instruction around themes to maximize opportunities for ELLs to acquire language and concepts  •             introducing and developing vocabulary by using visual supports as well as context based examples  •             encouraging ELLs to use bilingual dictionaries for native language support during reading and writing activities in order  to clarify meaning     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      C. For our developing students, who are able to respond in simple sentences and have greater receptive skills in comparison to  their expressive abilities, instruction will focus on activities that are designed to:  •             Develop higher level of language use in the content areas by supporting the development of Tier II and and Tier III  vocabulary  •             Encourage the use of reading comprehension strategies (summarizing, sequencing, inferring, comparing and  contrasting, drawing conclusions, self-questioning, problem solving, relating background knowledge, distinguishing between  fact and opinion, finding the main idea)  •             foster self-monitoring skills  Strategies used for these developing students are:  •             Modeling the writing process through brainstorming activities that are visually displayed via graphic organizers, charts,  and think-alouds  •             Explicitly teaching grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, as well as, the format for writing essays, reports, poetry  and letters.  •             Conferring with students to identify strengths and areas of need . These conferences provide data to drive instruction  to further support our students.  •             Small group instruction    D.            Long Term ELLs have been enrolled schools for more than six years, who are not progressing toward English  proficiency, and who are struggling academically due to their limited English skills. The leadership team, along with input from  previous and current classroom teachers, meet to discuss each student that falls into this sub-group. Most of the students in  our school who require 4-6 years of ESL instruction fall into four categories:  •             LEP students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction  •             LEP students held over in grade  •             LEP students who have not met the performance standard in reading  •             LEP students who have not met the performance standard in writing.  When an ELL has been enrolled in an English Language School System for more than two years, they no longer have  promotional criteria based on their ELL status and therefore can be held over if they do not meet grade level standards. For  students who are identified as needing extension of services (4-6 years) because they did not meet the performance standard  because they are held over s/he begins receiving Academic Intervention Services (AIS) by one of the specially trained AIS  teachers in addition to the instruction they receive from a certified ENL teacher.   These students are discussed at monthly School Implementation Team meetings to ensure progress is being made in Reading,  Writing, Listening, and Speaking. For the students who fall into the sub-group of not meeting the standard in reading both the  classroom teachers and ENL teachers work collaboratively to improve reading comprehension, fluency, accuracy, and decoding  skills by using the workshop model as a foundation of all reading instruction.   Students are grouped according to their reading level (as measured by Fountas and Pinnell) and according to the skill they are  working on.  All lessons are aligned to the CCLS to ensure that students have access to grade level texts. Short-term and long- term goals are set for each student with the ENL teacher and classroom teacher.  Curriculum maps have been designed by  grade level teams with input from the ENL staff that incorporate the CCLS. Teachers confer with students one-on-one and then  group students according to specific strategies that need to be practiced and mastered. Mentor texts are used to introduce the  new genre of the unit.   Each new writing unit begins with an on-demand writing task and culminates with a writing piece that shows the entire  process. Personalized word walls with visual supports are used to help individualize instruction and assist students with their  daily writing. Students are immersed in a print-filled environment                  Some strategies to support these developing ELLs are:  •             Providing context-enriching activities  •             Engaging students in small group activities  •             Providing multiple opportunities for students to learn through modeling  •             Modifying materials, activities, and assignments based on level of proficiency  •             Modifying lessons to develop skills in all the modalities    E.     Former ELLs are required to receive 90 integrated minutes of instruction per week. ENL teachers collaborate with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      classroom and content teachers to ensure that these students are receiving continued support, despite having demonstrated  proficiency in the English language. Some structures put into place to support these learners are:  •             Modified/leveled activities  •             Bilingual dictionaries  •             Glossaries  •             Continuing to focus on building academic language through the use of modeling and visual support     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students that are identified as ELLs and SWDs receive support in a variety of ways. These students can be placed in  heterogeneous classrooms and receive the support of an ENL teacher, a special education teacher, or both. Students with  disabilities may be in an integrated co-teaching classroom or a self-contained classroom for part of the day, with the  opportunity to participate in advanced math, ELA, and content classes. Students may receive leveled texts to support their  learning in academic content areas, along with visuals, word banks, and glossaries. Material will also be presented to students  through the use of technology to engage and appeal to all students.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Middle school students are programmed individually to suit their strengths and areas of need. Students may be in an advanced  ELA class, and receive ENL integrated instruction in their social studies class.  Grades K-5 use curriculum maps, and vertical planning to know and prepare for the year to come and expectations of the  following year.  An example of this would be that struggling students might receive toolkits that would be provided for  previous grade as a scaffold.  ENL teachers collaborate with the general education teacher to modify lessons to have multiple  entry points to meet the needs of the diverse learners in the classroom.  Additionally, teachers use assessments to create  groups for guided reading, and flexible groupings for strategy lessons.  Students are serviced based on IEP needs not program needs.  Students are mainstreamed and placed in the the least  restrictive environment.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  he targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are available to students as after-school  programs.  These programs have a low student-teacher ratio.  Students are grouped based on their ELA level, their NYSESLAT  proficiency level, their F&P reading level and several other factors.  All ELLs who fall into one of the categories are required to  attend.  This includes beginners, ELLs with special needs, SIFE, and long-term ELLs. Programs include Fundations, Targeted  Guided Reading.  All intervention programs are taught in English with native language support.  Middle school teachers offer  support for struggling students during lunch hours.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are available to students as after-school  programs.  These programs have a low student-teacher ratio.  Students are grouped based on their ELA level, their NYSESLAT  proficiency level, their F&P reading level and several other factors.  All ELLs who fall into one of the categories are required to  attend.  This includes beginners, ELLs with special needs, SIFE, and long-term ELLs. Programs include Fundations, Targeted  Guided Reading.  All intervention programs are taught in English with native language support.  Middle school teachers offer  support for struggling students during lunch hours.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are not considering discontinuing any ELL programs or services at this time.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL’s are integrated in the general education classrooms.  There are no self-contained ENL classes.  Students are taught the  same curriculum as all other students.  An ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher to provide modifications to the  lesson plans, and co-teaches with the classroom teacher.  Also, notices that are sent home, are offered in all languages that are  represented in our student population.  ENL after-school program is an enrichment program intended to expose students to  new experiences while developing language. The after-school program offers cooking, art, drama, origami, imaginative play,  literacy centers, as well as a few others.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use a variety of instructional materials to support our ELLs. We use Teachers College literacy curriculum which is based on  leveled classroom libraries at appropriate reading levels.  Students choose books based on interest and unit of study that is on  their reading level.  Additionally, students are provided with ENL binders that are used to provide supports, such as vocabulary  lists, graphic organizers, and various other scaffolds that foster independence in the classroom during the time in which ENL  teachers are not present.  Students are also provided with access to various paid computer programs, such as, RAZ-kids, Myon,  BrainPop, as well as lexia for upper grades. All classrooms have a smartboard, and have a set of chromebooks, and ipads.  We  also have a Teachers College coach that provides support to teachers to differentiate and meet the needs of their  learners.  We use Fundations phonics program to help students with phonemic awareness.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is incorporated into ESL instruction throughout the day.  We accomplish this several ways.  One  strategy we utilize is partnering ELLs with a native language speaker.  We provide word-to-word glossaries and bilingual  dictionaries in students’ native languages.  We have books in classroom libraries in their native language.  We provide  translators-either peer or staff members when needed.  During class discussions, group instruction, small group instruction, or  one-on-one, students can use a variety of ways of communicating-pictures, representations, drawings, technology programs  that offer translations and an interpreter to help them in both languages.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels as per CR-Part 154 and are scaffolded using ENL  methodologies and best practices.  The ENL teachers use the same Common Core Learning Standards that classroom teachers  use to plan lessons and guide instruction.  At times, we scaffold the content to make it more accessible to our newcomers by  providing high interest, low readability articles and books.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher and  shares resources.  These resources look like the resources that you would find in the general education class.  (For example,  you will not see cartoon ABC worksheets in a 5th grade class in our school.)         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?         Our school does not share a building with another school.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).             PS 206 is dedicated to promoting a safe, comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for newly enrolled ELL students.  Our plan to  assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year includes the following:    •              Early Registration for newly-enrolled students is done prior to the opening of school in September.  •              Students who register in the last week of August get to meet with an ENL teacher, parent coordinator , and/or  assistant principal (J. Mendelsohn) and get a brief tour of the school.  Students can see the main parts of the building, cluster  classrooms, arrival and dismissal entrances and exits, and any other place so they can see how the school runs.   •              Parents are invited to a formal, parent orientation meeting where they can learn about our ENL program. They also  have an opportunity to learn more about the school curriculum and programs during the September Curriculum Night.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         •              For students who registered earlier in the summer or the previous spring, within the first ten days of school starting,  the NYSITELL is administered to students whose home language is other than English.  •              During the registration and NYSITELL process, ENL teachers, the pupil accounting secretary, the parent coordinator,  administrators and translators work as a team to assist parents, address their concerns, understand and complete forms, test,  and assign placements for ELL students.  •              Classroom teachers have been trained to provide additional help to newly enrolled ELL students with their transition  into a new environment. Newly enrolled ELLs are paired with a buddy student who speaks their language to help develop a  support system for them. Our school has a large immigrant population so there are often many English speaking students in  most classes who also speak the same native language as new ELL students. These students have proven very valuable in  helping to assist the new ELLs.   •              Students are partnered up with other students to form triads so that during a discussion, the new student can  participate in their native language and also benefit from listening to a genuine conversation in English.  •              Starter packets are given to our older new admits that teaches them important information about their new school,  their home, and the neighborhood.                   17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Fifth grade students receive Spanish instruction; it is an enrichment course to provide foundational skills for middle school  Spanish. Students in grades 6-8 are offered Spanish and Latin.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a) The Russian-English dual language program will be a self-contained class, with 50/50 model. The  classroom will contain ENL students whose home language is Russian, and the other half of the class  population will be composed of non-ELL’s.  b) Reading, writing, foundations, math, science, and social studies will be taught in English.  Shared  Reading, Read alouds, and some math, science, and social studies will be taught in Russian.  c) The languages will be separated for instruction using the 50/50 model- half the day instruction will be  taught in English, while the rest of the day will be taught in Russian.  d) Literacy will be taught in the child’s home language first.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for all ELL personnel (ESL teachers, general education, and special education teachers,  cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, related service providers, guidance counselor, SAPIS worker, secretaries, and anyone else  that have ELLs in their classes) is coordinated by our administration in conjunction with the staff.  Teachers are encouraged to  seek out Professional Development opportunities which they feel will help them become more effective teachers.  The  administrative staff collaborates to combine ideas and find opportunities for teachers to participate in effective professional  development and planning for teachers. Teachers take initiative to share best practices with their coworkers to support our ELL  population.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Additionally, ENL teachers upload resources into a shared folder on Google Drive which is accessible to all members of our  school staff. Staff may access these materials and use them at any point in the school year to support their students.  Professional development is presented by the principal, assistant principals, and ENL teachers throughout the year.  The  tentative schedule for professional development for all personnel who work with ELLs is described below.  The professional  development is presented to the entire staff, including but not limited to:  paraprofessionals, common branch teachers, cluster  teachers, special education teachers, ESL teachers, Guidance counselor, psychologists, occupational and physical therapists,  speech therapists and the parent coordinator.  Professional Development is provided on Monday afternoons and Chancellor  Conference Days.  Many teachers are  also participating  in a Fordham University program, where half the tuition is supplemented, to receive  their ENL extension certification.  The school principal is working with closely with the BFSC, along with attending workshops at Fordham University to further  develop the professional development of ENL teachers.  Administration and teachers are attending ELL training as part of our  partnership with Teachers College. Teachers College is supporting instruction with a focus on our ELL students.  The school is part of the District Charter Collaborative, where we partner up with public schools and charter schools. Though  an inquiry based approach, we observe where the school needs support, develop a learning focus area, create a goal, and  make an action plan in order to meet the goal. We also participated in ongoing inter-visitations, where we shared our best  practices and conducted discussions focused on areas of improvement.  District 22 is also part of a pilot program called Ambassadors where teachers in all content areas meet monthly to discuss best  practices, and have study groups to strengthen their pedagogical practices.                   2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Staff attends ongoing professional development sessions offered by the Brooklyn Field Support Center. Staff developers from  Teacher’s College collaborate with classroom teachers in curriculum development and monthly professional development  sessions. The ENL teacher collaborates with his or her respective grades during these sessions.  Administration also encourages  all staff to seek out additional professional development that they believe will improve their practice.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At P.S. 206 we recognize the importance of parental involvement in the education of all of our students.  We offer many  opportunities for all parents to learn about the curricula and education that their child receives.  Parents are invited and welcomed into the school. The Parent Coordinator sends out a monthly newsletter and daily emails  keeping parents informed about what is going on in the school and/or in the community.  Each grade also sends out a  newsletter with the units of study, strategies to help their children, and upcoming events.   We keep parents informed of their children’s academic progress (reading level and math level) through the academic updates  sent home in November, March and June. We send home a mid-year Progress Report in January which was created by the  school to provide parents more feedback on their child’s academic progress. In our report cards, parents receive the RISA  report indicating their child’s attendance data.  We have a strong Parent Association and we have 8 parents that participate on the School Leadership Team.   Many workshops specifically target ELL parents, such as ELL Parent Orientation meetings where parents are introduced to the  different ELL programs, Title III meetings (orientation for ELL parents on Title III after-school programs and special ELL Family  Events), and Title I parent meetings. All information that is distributed to the parents of ELLs is translated into as many  languages as possible, and translations services are provided whenever needed. In addition, parents are invited and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         encouraged to participate in Family Game night where parents participate and learn the value of playing games with their  children, Family Sports Night where parents participate and learn about different sports and activities they can play with their  child, teaching them the importance of physical activity, living a healthy lifestyle and good sportsmanship.   Informational meetings to help students achieve in all academic areas are offered throughout the year.  Informative testing  meetings in both ELA, Math, and Science, SESIS meetings, Schoolnet meetings, STARS information, the School Implementation  Team process and information, Promotional Criteria meetings, Middle School informational night, and Kindergarten  Orientation meetings are a few ways that we help parents stay informed of the standards and high expectations that we  expect from all or students.     The parent coordinator reaches out to parents of ELLs to discuss their concerns and questions with the help of a  translator.  Parent Association meetings and School Leadership Team meetings offer a venue for parents to have their voices  heard. The administration, Parent Coordinator, and school representatives at these meetings bring issues and concerns back to  the ENL teachers and a plan is made to address the subject. Staff who serve as translators attend these meetings to translate  to a variety of languages. Reflection forms are distributed to parents after workshops and used as exit slips to ensure that we  are meeting their needs and addressing their concerns.  From this data, many opportunities are provided to our ELL parents to  become more involved in our school and their child's education.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Enrichment programs and extracurricular activities such as: music concerts, Science Fair, Arts Fair, Kindergarten Fair, Transition  from Pre-K to Kindergarten parent workshop,  Pajama Read Aloud where Pre-K through grade 2 students read with their  parents and friends on blankets spotlight the hard work of our students and shared with parents both during school and at  night to accommodate all families.  Many families attend and look forward to joining the school community and supporting  their child’s school. Through our Halloween parties and Talent Show we have increased parent involvement and have raised  funding to purchase extra materials and programs.  We offer our non-English speaking parents an adult education class so that  they can learn conversational English and speak to their family and school community members as part of our ENL after-school  program.  We also invite parents monthly to participate in “parents as learning partners,” they visit their child’s classroom and usually  work with their child in an engaging hands-on activity that informs parents on current unit of study.  Additionally, parents were  invited every other month to an open house during family engagement time. Parents are also invited to all publishing parties  to celebrate their child’s success and completion of a unit of study.  Our school works with a variety of Community Based Organizations that provide programs or services for parents of English  Language Learners.  We teach the children the importance of being part of a community and helping others through our  fundraisers for American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and St. Jude’s children’s hospital. Students collect  pennies for Penny Harvest and collect canned goods for City Harvest. We have an affiliation with the Food Bank of New York.  The first grade piloted a healthy cooking and eating program called Cookshop, where the teachers instructed the students  about fruits, vegetables and healthy eating. This program also has a parent component (Cookshop for Families) where the  Parent Coordinator holds a monthly class starting in January and parents learn the same curricula that their students are  learning are provided with healthy recipes and are given the ingredients to go home and cook with their children.                  Our Parent Coordinator works closely with our local Brooklyn Public Library Branch to assist ELL parents in completing  library card application forms and obtaining library cards. The Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn Public Library also offers free ESOL  materials, classes and conversation groups which our parents are happy to take advantage of.                   The Salt Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park serves a vital role in our neighborhood.  The parent coordinator assists  classroom teachers in arranging field trips to the Salt Marsh Nature Center and many ELL parents accompany their child on  these visits.  The Urban Park Rangers use the plants and animals of the salt marsh as object lessons in a variety of subjects,  including ecology, botany, and ornithology. Also, our school offers several other workshops and meetings throughout the year  that are presented by outside agencies.    The local precinct presents a Crime Prevention Workshop as well as attends our community safety meetings.  The Department  of Health presents a workshop entitled Healthy Homes which focuses on child safety.  Many of our primary classes participate  in Cookshop Classroom which also has a parent component where parents come to our school and learn how to cook healthy  meals for their families and then the participating parents receive all the food necessary to make the meals in their own  homes.                   Finally, Learning Leaders present a parent workshop on Storytelling and Bookmaking where parents learn how to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         incorporate these literacy activities at home with their children.  We have a partnership with our local homeless shelter where  we donate books, clothes, educational materials, and supplies to the families that are in transitional housing.  These parental involvement activities meet the needs of the ELL parents in several ways. They give parents an opportunity to  interact with other parents from the community and the school.  Parents can feel comfortable and included because  information is presented in English and is translated into their native language when needed. Parents learn valuable  information at the meetings as well as have the opportunity to see their children interact with other classmates and school  staff. These family nights, meetings, and information nights help our ELL parents become a part of their child's education  which, in turn, will help the ELL family realize that they are an essential, integral part of our school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ellen Quigley, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/IS 206                                                                              School DBN: 22k206  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We conduct our assessment of written translation and oral interpretation needs through our annual needs  assessment survey, informal interviews of parents and staff, Parents’ Preferred Language Survey, and data from  the Home Language Survey that is filled out by every parent when they register a student in the New York City  Department of Education. This document states any languages spoken in the student’s home and provides an  accurate census of the languages spoken by both the parents and students. The Home Language Survey also  shows whether or not a child and his/her family speaks English to a proficiency level high enough to understand  school communications without translations. These documents provide us with the necessary information needed  to communicate with the parents in the parent’s preferred language for both oral and written communication.  This information is collected and entered into ATS by the Pupil Accounting Secretary. A report is run in ATS (RAPL)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      which shows the language of preference for oral and written communication. Teachers are given a list of the  preferred language of the parents of the students in their class.                    2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication.

Above is a breakdown of  the data collected from  RCPL. The data suggests  that more parents are  comfortable having  information that is  presented orally in their  native language. One  reason for this is some of  our parents are not literate  in their native language.  We inform the teachers of  this information by giving  them a class list. Next to  each student a language is  written which indicates  what language the parents  prefer to have verbal and  written communication  with the school.           3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
