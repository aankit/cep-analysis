The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Middle School 301 is a small school located in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York. Thirty percent of our student  body have IEP's, seventeen percent are English Language Learners and seventy four percent are entitled to free lunch.  MS 301 is a learning community with clear standards and procedures known to staff, students, and parents. Educators  at MS 301 believe that a student’s intellectual growth must be stimulated in pursuit of academic excellence. Based on  the unique and diverse needs of the middle school student, we strive to provide an approach which encourages the  development of the aesthetic, social, physical, creative, and emotional aspects of each student. According to our  mission, we believe that all children can learn when empowered by teachers, supported by parents, and lead by  administrators who provide a nurturing, yet engaging environment. The instructional focus around writing from last  year will be fine tuned to include planning and refining to address the needs of diverse learners. We will refine our  practice by using discussion techniques across all classrooms that build and reveal new understanding of content and  practice by requiring students to fully explain and justify their thinking and their writing, constructing viable  arguments and critiquing the reasoning and writing of others. This will be done to improve discussion techniques  across all classrooms that build and reveal new understanding of content and practice by requiring students to: 1)  Fully explain and justify their thinking 2) Construct viable arguments 3) Critique the reasoning of others      MS 301 currently has 96 students: 69% Black, 15% Hispanic, 15% Asian, 5% White, 1% American Indian/Alaskan, and  5% Pacific Islander. Our school articulates from various Brooklyn communities as well as neighboring elementary  schools: PS 305, PS 44, PS 93, and PS 54. We began as a middle school program in Public School 305 in 2002 with  seventy five students. The school has developed a core academic program where students are challenged to  demonstrate higher level thinking skills. There is an Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) class on each grade. The  instructional program includes:      Junior Greatbooks     EngageNY Grades 6-8    Expeditionary Learning      Project Based Inquiry Science Program    Urban Advantage Science Initiative    Teacher's College Writing Project    myOn    Passports to Social Studies        iReady  Imagine Learning   Attaining proficient student progress has been a significant challenge for our school community. Therefore this has  become our area of focus. With the charge of providing our students with rigorous instruction, the data and evidence   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      indicate that we must consistently continue to provide our students with scaffolds and differentiated instruction as  we monitor all areas of progress.       The curriculum at Satellite East continues to evolve in content and implementation of various instructional programs  and special initiatives to engage our learners and to help our students show progress. Teachers will make revisions to  formative assessments. They will consistently use data to make instructional decisions based on student need.  Teachers will make adjustments and revisions to curriculum or the pacing of curriculum when needed.      Our school will be involved in the initiatives below:    Entrepreneurship(6-8) & Finance      Mathletics      Data Wise Inquiry Process    New Victory Theatre    Middle School Arts Initiative   We have worked hard to include our families in the academic progress of their children. We have articulated and  established clear expectations for parent roles in their children’s academic achievement. We also have provided  supports to help families understand student performance and have noted an increase in attendance and  achievement through our Shining Stars program. This year Partnership with Children will continue working with our  school community as the Community Based Organization partner. We are excited about continuing to strengthen the  home-community-school bridge with increased parent involvement on teams and forums for shared vision, to ensure  that our school meets the needs of all its students. Monday through Friday students will be provided with at least one  hour of extended learning time for additional academic support. During that hour long period students will have an  opportunity to use the iReady online program for ELA and Mathematics and Imagine Learning for our ENL students.  The iReady program is a progressive online tool that differentiates instruction and provides teachers data on student  growth and helps them to facilitate improved student outcomes. To ensure students are engaged in rigorous learning  experiences they also use Junior Great Books for shared inquiry of quality literature.   Professional development is an integral part of our learning community. Our teachers are active learners and regularly  seek opportunities to enhance their craft for providing intellectually stimulating content to ensure students are  engaged in the learning. We are participants in job embedded Lab-Sites and inquiry learning using the Data Wise  Model. Additionally, three members of the instructional cabinet have become certified in Data Wise training.  Teachers have attended sessions at Teachers College for executing their Writing Units of Study, Math Solutions, and  various sessions offered by the Office of School Renewal and District 13.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K301   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   99   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Our instructional focus is to continue to infuse writing in the content areas. Writing was the instructional focus for 2017- 2018. The instructional focus around writing from last year will be fine tuned to include planning and refining to address  the needs of diverse learners. We will refine our practice by using discussion techniques across all classrooms that build  and reveal new understanding of content and practice by requiring students to fully explain and justify their thinking  and their writing, constructing viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning and writing of others.       Upon completion of the Renewal Program we envision that our school will show improvements with tailoring and  supplementing the curriculum across content areas using Teachers College Writing Units of Study, myON digital  libraries, and EngageNY in Mathematics, informed by the regular use of data analysis from formative and summative  assessments. Our school teams will strengthen their use of inquiry and the Data Wise model to make more timely  adjustments to the curriculum and lesson plans in response to ongoing formative assessment data and memorialize  those adjustments for future use.      The Instructional Cabinet Inquiry Team set its focus to review and revise school wide practices based on gaps in teacher  practice illuminated in the inquiry process. The cabinet level inquiry practices were informed by the use of student  achievement data. In the past, significant chunks of time elapsed between administering formative assessments, scoring  and analyzing those assessments, and using that data to inform instructional decisions. The team made the decision to  adopt an immediate turn around time practice.      During the 2017-2018 school year, we instituted small instructional groups to provide academic support and growth to  students who were on the cusp of attaining academic proficiency and those who we feared might fall below proficiency.  The Instructional Cabinet looked at students summative data. The school uses summative data from benchmark  assessments including the iReady program, running records, and math performance tasks. Based on a review of ongoing  math common assessments, it was determined that eighth grade students demonstrated difficulty in solving equations  and using integers because of their lack of fluency with multiplication and division. Similar patterns were reflected in a  review of seventh grade data. As a result, curricular adjustments were made to include more opportunities for  practicing these skills during small group time. During classroom visits, administrators pay close attention to the work of  those students in the small group cohort to look for growth, trends, advancements in work, and revisions made by  teachers.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17      Consistent use of protocols in classrooms will promote active participation in discussions and debates where students  are challenged to explain and justify their reasoning of others. Teachers will model and facilitate the precise use of  language to extend students’ understanding of complex text. Multiple means of representation, expression, and  engagement will be required to provide all students with a differentiated pathway into rigorous content. On-going  checks for understanding will be incorporated into the beginning, middle and end of lessons, using a variety of  techniques to monitor student learning. Teachers will provide timely, detailed and constructive feedback to guide  students towards improved performance along common core aligned learning progressions. Twenty 7th graders are  taking course work to prepare them for taking the Algebra regents in eighth grade and twenty-two eighth graders will  take the Algebra regents in June.   We will utilize iReady and Ready to analyze and monitor student progress throughout the school year. iReady is a  progressive differentiated program that provides instant student data that teachers will use to fill in the instructional  gaps students have. Our staff will analyze work/data on a weekly basis, within horizontal and vertical teacher team  structures. They will use the data to make informed instructional next steps. The data reports from iReady will contain  common core expectations for student mastery of the material, identify which students met or did not meet the  criteria, help teachers utilize the Ready instructional material to bring students closer to mastery.   Monday through Friday students will be provided with at least one hour of extended learning time for additional  academic support for lesson retention, homework help as well assignment recovery or enrichment. In order to ensure  students are engaged in rigorous learning experiences, the school along with the community based organization,  Partnership With Children will support our students using the iReady ELA and Mathematics Program and Imagine  Learning for our ENL students (new for the 2017-2018 school year).   We envision that 10% of our student population will show measurable growth in ELA and Math.         What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   To narrow and deepen the scope to ensure more time and energy is spent teaching the concepts in prioritized  standards. Adjust the curriculum to ensure a coherent flow of the standards. We will utilize the integrated collaborative  teaching model, utilizing anchor charts, and rubrics for students to receive timely feedback, reflect on their work and  make adjustments to increase student ownership of their academic growth.   Teachers will be focused on implementing the instructional programs with fidelity from last year. Our steps this year will  be to modify and make adjustments to curriculum units of study, lesson plans, and also memorializing the work from  based on the needs of students, and incorporating strategies shared during professional development sessions.            What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  Regular practice with complex text, academic language, reading, writing, and speaking grounded in evidence from  literary and informational texts will continue to be provided through The Teachers College Writing Units of Study. The  new social studies core curriculum and the expanded adoption of science units of study through PBISCI will support  building knowledge through content rich non-fiction.   In grade 6 ratios and proportional relationships, early algebraic expressions and equations will be prioritized. In grade 7  ratios and proportional relationships, and arithmetic of rational numbers take precedence. In grade 8 linear algebra and  linear functions are the major focus. Overall, students will engage in a variety of tasks in mathematics : fluency routines,   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      utilizing the problem solving process of real world situations, making connections between prioritized domains of  standards to close conceptual gaps identified in short frequent formative assessments.          What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   The school community will continue to build upon integrating a common understanding of rigorous and engaging  instruction through the use of the Rigor and Engagement rubrics from the International Center for Leadership in  Education, through formative observations and feedback from school leaders and peers. These observations coupled  with video analysis of standards driven instruction that provides high level tasks promoting questioning, discussion and  embedded assessment practices will be used to improve delivery of instruction. We will also convene, provide ongoing  feedback and revisit classrooms to see how the revisions of lessons have addressed student deficiencies.   Teachers will structure their classes for independent work, pairs, groups, and whole class in thoughtful and deliberate  ways to scaffold independent and collaborative completion of rigorous task.         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  There is a plan for special education and ESL teachers to collaborate with multiple school staff members to lead  professional development on multiple entry points and ESL strategies and techniques.This is to build upon the work  teachers began with students ensuring that they use rubrics to set goals and become more reflective through self  analysis of their work and peer evaluations of writing. In mathematics teachers will build upon the work using  performance tasks and mathematical discussions. This collaboration will result in a menu of Multiple Entry Point  strategies that all can pull from.   Students should have multiple opportunities to use a variety of representations to communicate their ideas followed by  written justifications. Students will also connect their current learning to previously learned standards.   Students will utilize higher order thinking skills and be able to problem solve when they encounter unfamiliar context.  Students will also read academically rich text from across content areas to gather evidence to develop an understanding  of the content.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  There is a school-wide assessment plan for the 2018-2019 school year. This revised assessment calendar includes iReady  for ELA and math and Imagine Learning for our ENL students in addition to all other assessments- diagnostic, baseline,  benchmark, and formative tests. We will also decrease the amount of time spent between administering, scoring and  analyzing assessment data to modify instruction and monitor impact on student achievement and teaching practices.  Our school will utilize the ALL In Learning tools to assist us in using the data in real time.    * This year we will modify and make adjustments to curriculum units of study, lesson plans, and also memorialize the  work based data focusing on the needs of students, and incorporating strategies shared during professional  development sessions.

Staff and teacher teams help  students and families understand student progress and offer feedback to prepare them for the next level.   School leaders consistently establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and  families and provides feedback and guidance to them.   Parents shared the many ways they communicate with the school and spoke of the open door policy that exists with  the teachers and the administrators. Parents receive information about their children’s achievement and school-related  activities via emails, phone calls, quarterly progress reports, report cards, monthly calendars and newsletters. The  school also uses Jupiter Grade, an online tracking and grading system, and invites parents to sit in on lessons (The staff  sets the tone in the school for what is expected from students. The Shining Stars awards assemblies and breakfast  promote student academic and citizenship growth. Guidance counselors meet with students individually and in groups,  organize high school fairs for seniors, and sit in classrooms to observe students in an academic setting to better support  them. An overage class is offered to the large overage population in the school to best help the staff meet their unique  needs.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          26       Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?  Middle School 301, would like stakeholders to view us as a school that creates a classroom and school culture where  students feel safe, supported and challenged by teachers as well as their peers. To this end, we will continue to develop  and advance our collaborative strategies which will include having transparent dialogue to improve student learning, to  promote the safety of our students, where students help to mobilize their peers to exhibit appropriate classroom and  school behavior while pushing for an environment that is academically rigorous and supportive. This environment is one  that employs the support our partner organization-Partnership with Children, Morningside Heights and the We  Organization. Within these organizations we have collaborations to ensure that students feel safe, classroom behavior is  appropriate, and conducive to learning. It is important that everyone pushes towards academic achievement, is  knowledgeable about our students and is fully supportive of the rigorous academic work that must be done. It is an  environment therefore, that provides parent informational sessions and workshops, parent handbooks, and student  handbooks to share the type of environment that will aid in students’ achievement and help to deepen their  understanding of college and career readiness so that they can be empowered to support the school and their children  in maximizing their full potential.    For the 2018-2019 school year, our primary support organization, Partnership with Children, will provide data driven  support to strengthen the emotional, social, ethical, and cognitive skills of our students especially those who are at risk,  so that they can succeed at Satellite East Middle School, in society, and in their lives. They will also provide counseling,  family engagement, referrals, and collaborate with additional community organizations. Teacher training/coaching will  be provided to support and develop the various working systems within our school. In addition, students will be  encouraged so that their voice will be promoted and supported through the use of student government. Student  government will work to plan activities for the student body as well as help to identify opportunities and mobilize their  peers to participate in socially successful activities like service learning (We Organization), student led Parent Teacher  Conferences as well as support their representative(s) on School Leadership Team.   Satellite East will use Restorative Circles (Morningside Heights) as our Social-emotional learning framework. This  program is a community process that will be used for supporting students in conflict. We will use Restorative Circles to  bring together the three parties to a conflict – those who have acted, those directly impacted and the wider community  – within an intentional systemic context, to dialogue as equals. This framework will be used to foster the dialogue  process which is shared openly with all participants, and guided by a community member. Most importantly, as a circle  forms, they invite shared power, mutual understanding, self-responsibility and effective action.   Lastly, without the presence of students in school, our efforts would be useless. We will therefore address attendance.  Attendance and absenteeism rates will improve using Morning Announcements to encourage punctuality and Success  Mentoring. Various incentives will be awarded to students who have 95% punctuality each month. Students with Perfect  Attendance will also be recognized. In addition, each student receives recognition for improved effort at monthly  Shining Stars Assemblies. We will also implement a monthly competition among classes and grade levels and provide  incentives for those students who possess excellent attendance facilitated by our Community School Director-Amal  Alassari.         Who are your CBO partners? How will each CBO sustain and support the social-emotional and academic growth of  your students?

Provide incentives to help promote and improve attendance rates.   n/a   n/a            How will you in partnership with your CBO will create a supportive environment and engagement for your students’  families?  We will collaboratively use the New Vision Data Sorter to monitor the impact of attendance, academic and social  supports. The New Vision Data Sorter and Heat Maps will be used to monitor the impact of the attendance and social  supports our CBO has provided. We will also provide families with support in the form of monthly workshops and  meetings.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks.  By June 2019, through the active outreach and involvement of success mentors, there will be a 10% increase of at risk  students attendance as evident in the New Vision's Data Sorter.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Supportive Environment Annual Goal:  Which Renewal and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks do you expect will improve by meeting your  Supportive Environment Annual Goal?   With the support and assistance from our Success Mentors, the average daily attendance will improve by 10%.    With the support and assistance from our CBO, expect to increase our parent involvement by 10%.

Grade level teams look  at and monitor student  achievement,  attendance and  progress data and plan  in an effort to improve  student outcomes.    In teams we analyze all  areas of student data- demographic, student  learning, perception,  and process so that all  stakeholders are able to  understand the needs  of all students. We  utilize data to support  student social and  emotional health. Some  examples are:    Attendance team  works with over-aged  students with  attendance and  lateness issues.

Daily morning assembly  promotes regular and  punctual attendance.  Classes with the highest  attendance and  punctuality rate are  given incentives like an  additional gym period,  pizza party, or dress  down day. Incentives  gradually progress.   Our school uses  behavioral intervention  plans (BIP) designed for  specific children to help  them learn to change  undesirable behaviors  in a respectful and  caring way. Once the  function of a student's  behavior has been  determined, the  Individual Education  Program (IEP) Team  develops the behavior  intervention plan. We  use behavioral  intervention plans to  support students in  order to help them  change their behavior.

Areas of Strength:    Quality Review Report Findings 2017-2018   Across classrooms, teachers use and create rubrics. Their assessment practices reflect the use of ongoing checks for  understanding, opportunities for students to self-assessment and teachers providing actionable feedback to students.   The majority of teachers are engaged in teacher-led structured inquiry based professional collaborations during which  they look at student work and there are opportunities for staff input into instructional decisions.    The teacher inquiry collaborations promote the achievement of school goals and the implementation of the Common  Core. They result in improved teacher capacity and student progress towards goals and help teachers to have a voice in  key decisions .   Teachers meet at minimum two to three times a week in grade teams, content teams and for professional development  sessions. During the teacher teams, they rotate their roles to allow every teacher a chance at facilitation. The roles on  the teams include facilitator, time keeper, and recorder. Minutes are shared with the staff online for feedback and  transparency. All teams use a common protocol to facilitate the work in team meetings.

Needs/Areas for Improvement:    Quality Review Report Findings 2017-2018   The school’s instructional core beliefs center on providing students with opportunities to engage in  tasks where productive struggle exists and engaging students in discussion and in working in  groups. In an Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) English Language Arts (ELA) class,  students were discussing a text as a class where they connected the content with the author’s  narrative techniques. During the discussion, students compared parts of the text and determined  how and why the author used techniques, including inner thinking and description, to illustrate  parts of the text. However, this level of engagement and discussion was not prevalent across all  classes.            Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     At Satellite East Middle School, teacher collaboration occurs through various team meetings throughout the year.  Teachers collaborate based on content/subject area; grade team meetings: teachers who teach multiple grade levels  alternate between grade meetings weekly or monthly; scheduled mentoring sessions, where an experienced teacher is  paired with a new teacher, in order to provide necessary support; and common planning with co-teachers, where  lessons are planned, revised, re-taught, and accommodations made, based on student data. During these meetings,  teachers engage in professional conversations about student’s work/performance, and academic decisions are made  based on these findings.   Teaching is based on the Danielson’s Teaching Framework. Lessons entail real-world applications of the Common Core  Learning Standards, (CCLS). Teachers create standard-based, rigorous lessons that meet the different learning styles of  students. On-going scaffolding and modification for all students, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and students  with disabilities (SWD) are done. Lessons are tiered to ensure rigor is established for all students at any levels. The  learning environment is one in which students are engaged in small and whole class discussions; students lead these  discussions, while teachers act as facilitators. Students complete independent as well as group work, and actively make  presentations in class. The underlying principles that influence the creation of units and lessons are student data, the  requirements of the curriculum, and the CCLS, on which lessons are based. Teachers do work collaboratively to create  unit plans according to subject area and grade. This allows for interdisciplinary teaching across the grades, as teachers  are responsible for teaching reading within their content areas. This also helps to strengthen students’ knowledge and  abilities, as they are able to integrate learning across content areas. Students are placed in flexible groupings based on  various data.       Performance tasks in math are more real-world based. In ELA these students are exposed to the 9-grade CCLS and tasks.  They are also expected to make deeper –level inferences as they explore and write expository and argument responses  to texts. Higher-level achieving students head/lead group discussions, engage in peer-tutoring, and make power point  presentations. Overall, students are exposed to tasks above grade level. The opportunity further includes these students  participating in the Urban Advantage Teaching Program, which allows students to visit science institutions for free.  Students explore science related fields, activities, and hands-on explorations.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          35      To ensure a safe learning environment, there is a safety team that discusses safety concerns and makes  recommendations. During the transition between classes, teachers stand at their doors, and actively monitor the halls.  When classes resume or at lunch periods, the dean and those on hall and lunch duty, circulate the hall/lunch room/yard,  during the designated periods. There is open-access to someone in authority in the main office at all times, in the case  of an emergency. In addition, the school has a discipline referral ladder. When a behavior incident occurs, the teacher  conferences with the student; the next step may be that the parent is contacted; there is a conference with the parent,  child and guidance counselor or social worker.    Teachers review a variety of data regularly to ensure that they plan for individual student needs. These are reviewed  and discussed in teams. The data is based on observations as students work or conference with teachers; and students’  written work and assessments, including diagnostic tests, and exit slips.       We invite various community professionals and leaders to our College and Career Day event, as we try to expose mainly  our senior students, and widen their options for high school and the world of work.           How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  Our school's Instructional Leadership Team include teacher team leaders and administrators. The Instructional  Leadership Team meets weekly to discuss and monitor goals and structures that have been established. The cabinet will  look at the work of teams from the previous year and determine what worked, what did not. As a school we will make  adjustments and revisions to our curriculum, unit plans and lesson plans.         How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Each vertical team rotates the role of facilitator using the Data Wise Model to monitor the impact of teacher practice on  student achievement in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies.         How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   We use Google Docs to share data.     What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)

Multiple structures are in place to address the academic and social needs of students to achieve school-wide goals on an  ongoing basis. We increase teacher capacity to ensure improved instructional strategies and delivery through job- embedded professional development provided by educational consultants who work with teachers on data analysis,  instructional best practices, and implementation of the Common Core Instructional shifts. Gap and item analysis data  from student assessments will be used at data meetings to inform teacher improvement strategies and monitor the  areas targeted for improvement with the educational consultants providing teacher assistance. In cyclical inquiry teams,  teachers will assess the quality of students’ work through reviews of homework assignments, organization of course  content notes, student understanding of specific course content, and quiz grades . Common planning meetings and  grade level meetings focus on student work and provide support across grade levels. School leaders conduct formal and  informal observations and walk-through of classrooms to assess instructional practices, and we provide timely feedback,  electronically and through informal conversations.   Partnership with Children- our community based organization, will conduct assessments of student needs by gathering  information from a variety of sources including school administrator, teachers, parents, direct observation of and  interaction with students, and analysis of relevant student data. Under the direct care of social workers, students are  triaged into the appropriate level of care, with parent consent. Social workers meet with assigned students once a week  for 45-min sessions to work on social, behavioral, emotional, academic, family, and attendance goals. Social workers  may have more frequent contact with these students for urgent behavioral intervention or crisis intervention. Social  workers also facilitate social-emotional learning lessons that help students build social skills, provide tools to effectively  express themselves and manage conflict, and teach students leadership skills.   Social workers also provide classroom-based interventions around topics such as Respect for All, Anti-Bullying, and  Healthy Relationships. Partnership with Children staff are available to direct all students and families to needed concrete  resources such as health care clinics, housing resources, legal aid, and emergency assistance programs. Social workers  will attend appointments with families to act as advocates and to assist in navigating systems. Partnership with Children  also participates in planning and hosting school-wide events and field trips that promote positive school culture and  expose students to activities that enrich their lives.    We allocate resources to promote and support the academic achievement of students. We also provide support services  for English language learners during the after-school program to keep students on the path toward academic readiness.  We have an English as Second Language (ESL) teacher and general education mathematics teacher to work with small  groups of students in the program. We have been consistently proactive in devoting resources to areas of need, allowing  the school to support student achievement.      We support the academic and social achievement of our students with monthly recognition as our school's Shining  Stars. The Shining Stars Assembly is held at the end of every month where students are recognized for their efforts and  abilities. At the conclusion of the school year, students are invited to participate in a Shining Stars Scholars Ball.

The school’s instructional core beliefs center on providing students with opportunities to engage in  tasks where productive struggle exists and engaging students in discussion and in working in  groups. In an Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) English Language Arts (ELA) class,  students were discussing a text as a class where they connected the content with the author’s  narrative techniques.           What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Curricula-aligned rubrics are regularly used by teachers to gauge student understanding of a task.  A review of student work reflects feedback that provides students with suggested areas of growth  and next steps to improve the quality of their work products.          How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  The school will utilize the online communication system-Jupiter Grades to ensure participation of parents. Parents can  log on to see student data and grades.         How often will the school leader conduct observations?  How quickly will school leader share actionable feedback with  teachers? How will school leader ensure accuracy and provide support to teachers based on observation feedback?

Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families  feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their  schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family  engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

Additional task of the Educational Specialist will be the following:   • Explicit reading instruction and practice   • Student mastery of the reading skills in one book before progressing to the next   • Daily recording of student attendance, progress, and mastery   • Analyzing progress data to monitor success and identify and communicate areas of    concern   Partnership with Children social workers conduct assessments of student needs by gathering information from a  variety of sources including school administrator, teachers, parents, direct observation of and interaction with  students, and analysis of relevant student data. Under the direct care of licensed Master level Social Workers,  students are then triaged into the appropriate level of care, with parent consent. Students with the highest level of  need, for example, students with debilitating psychiatric issues, are referred to mental health services outside of the  school. The next level of service is individual counseling. Social workers meet with assigned students once a week for  45-min sessions to work on social, behavioral, emotional, academic, family, and attendance goals. Social workers may  have more frequent contact with these students for urgent behavioral intervention or crisis intervention. The next  level of service is small group counseling. Social workers facilitate social-emotional learning lessons that help students  build social skills, provide tools to effectively express themselves and manage conflict, and teach students leadership  skills.   Our extended learning time program is designed to support student and school community success, and provide new  and enriching experiences for students that would not be offered during school day hours. Our  collaboration/partnership with Partnership with Children during the school day will be a true collaboration, with goals  and expectations determined in tandem with students, and families so that all stakeholders have a clear  understanding of, and are invested in, the program activities. Partnership will implement multiple methods of  communications feedback collection to improve the effectiveness of our after-school program. The program director  will have bi-weekly check-in meetings with the Partnership with Children site-supervisor (school day program) and  school administration to address any concerns, and allow time for suggestions/questions to move the program   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          59      forward and improve student outcomes.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title I School Improvement  1003(a)  Title I Priority and Focus  School Improvement Funds   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   155,570.00           0    0    0    921,136.00                          Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)                         1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          67     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K301, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Middle School 301 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          69      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy skills are assessed using running records. This assessment provided insights into reading comprehension  weaknesses and inform instructional practices regarding reading skill needs for all three grade levels. In addition, teacher- created assessments are implemented in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of English Language Learners in the  four language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) The assessments serve in aiding instruction by helping to  develop instructional plans and creating teacher and student goals to meet the linguistic, cultural and educational needs of all  ELLs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          77         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Through active monitoring, the ENL teacher and content teachers confer a separate occasions several times throughout the  year to discuss the specific needs of  ELLs in their content area classes. Based on those meetings, appropriate strategies are  determined and implemented to help the students access the content.  In addition, throughout the year the ELLs receive  formal teacher-created assessments to track their progress in acquiring and strengthening their language skills in all four  modalities. At the end of the year NYSESLAT score is compared to the NYSITELL and are analyzed to evaluate the success of  each student as well as the ENL program at 13K301.The school administration conducts classroom visits and reviews student  scholarship data to support teachers in their instructional best practices.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on the results of the NYSITELL between the and 2015-2016 2016-2017 school year. The data patterns reveal that a  majority (about 75%)  the students showed weakness in reading and writing. Half of the students received their best scores, in  listening and speaking, about 77%. They received intermediate scores initially on the NYSITELL and later received emerging and  expanding scores on the NYSESLAT, which shows some progress in their language acquisition.  The other half of the students  received very low scores for all four language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) These students initially  received entering level scores on the NYSITELL and they are currently entering level proficient. The NYSESLAT data reveals the  typical results of a second language learner in their first three years of language acquisition. The students are stronger in  speaking and listening and need more support in reading and writing.   The data suggests that vocabulary acquisition is needed to assist the students in becoming more proficient in reading and  writing.   The data reveals that our students need to make greater strides from year to year on the NYSESLAT on all grade and  proficiency levels.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The goal of our ENL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive classroom environment. Instruction is  delivered in both a Stand-Alone ENL model and Integrated ENL model of 45 minutes periods with small groups of no  more than six students over two consecutive grade levels, who are also on the same language proficiency level.  Students follow the same curriculum as monolingual students and the ENL teacher collaborates with the monolingual   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          78         to share assessment data and next steps. This provides the students, preparation for transition to monolingual  settings. During specified teaching periods the ELA and ENL teacher have collaborate. The ENL teacher will push-in as  needed to fulfill each students required minutes as mandated by CR-Part 154 to provide support and scaffolds for the  ENL students in their content area classes. In order to ensure that the mandated instructional period of time is  provided according to proficiency levels, the ENL teacher is provided the data showing each student’s NYSESLAT  scores and corresponding mandated requirement of instructional time. The ENL teacher creates the ENL schedule  which is approved by the Principal of the school to ensure compliance. Students at the following levels: Entering  (formerly known as Beginning), Emerging ( Low Intermediate), Transitioning (formerly known as Intermediate), and  Expanding (formerly known as Advanced) receive 360, 360, 180, and 180  minutes respectively of ENL instruction  which includes ENL instruction in Literacy and content areas per week. Students at the Commanding (formerly known  as Proficient) level receive two 45 minute periods, totaling 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week. ENL instruction  utilizes hands-on activities and use of graphic organizers in small groups. The Integrated Model provides mandates for  students according to their proficiency levels/grades. The ENL certified teacher provides support in the integrated  class using small group previewing lessons, strategies/methodologies using the four modalities. Content teacher and  ENL teacher collaborate to make content instruction consistent and accessible.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 Ms. McCormick, ENL teacher, incorporates both Integrated ENL (collaborates with content area teachers and works  with the students in their content area classrooms) as well as Stand-Alone ENL services (students meet in a freestanding ENL in  small groups), which allows for more individualized lessons that cater to student needs.  MS. Taylor schedules both her pull  out classes and Integrated ENL sessions in order to meet the individual mandates of CR-Part 154, of each student according to  their proficiency level entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding. The entering and emerging students  receive 360 minutes (entering- 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL / emerging- 90 minutes  Stand Alone ENL, 180 minutes of Integrated ENL, and 90 minutes of either Stand-Alone or Integrated), the transitioning and  expanding students receive 180 minutes (transitioning - 90 minutes of Integrated and 90 minutes of either Stand-Alone or  Integrated ENL / expanding - 180 minutes of Integrated ENL), and the commanding students (former ELLs) receive 90 minutes  (either Stand-Alone or Integrated ENL) per week of mandated ENL services. For the Stand-Alone model, students are grouped  according to their proficiency levels. The entering and emerging group is provided with ample opportunities to develop  vocabulary, learn vocabulary building skills, and fluency skills. Social and situational speaking is encouraged in a small group  setting for students at these levels. The transitioning and expanding level students are supported in continuing to build their  fluency skills, and academic vocabulary development to improve reading and writing skills, and acquire more skills (effective  questioning and use of context clues) to assess their own learning in order to encourage them to become more independent  learners.  In addition to that, the commanding level grouping continues to work on class discussion skills, and writing skills. All  students are given their mandated services and are given extra time during the 37.5 minutes. All students are being supported  in the Common Core Learning Standards for all the core content areas: ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies. The students  also participate in after school supplemental programs in ELA and Math. In addition to their mandated ENL services the ELLs  also receive intervention services twice per week to support ELA and Math during the school day.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Ms. Taylor is using Differentiated Instruction in order to individualize instruction for all learners ( groupings based on levels,  varied activities and techniques are used to provide meaningful engagement in the classroom). Ongoing professional  development in the content areas by lead teachers and coaching is provided by Ms. Hazlewood, Assistant Principal in order to   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          79      provide solid instruction due to the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. The school is using CMP3 Math  Curriculum and Expeditionary Learning for their ELA Curriculum and ongoing professional development is provided and turn  keyed to the teachers throughout the school year.   In order to maximize language acquisition for ELLs, Ms. McCormick, ESL teacher and classroom teachers work closely to deliver  literacy instruction as well as tailor additional content instruction to meet the needs of the ELLs. Ms. Taylor, ESL teacher also  assists in the acquisition of language using the supporting materials ( Continental books) on to assist the ESL students in  achieving success in the Common Core Curriculum. Students use dictionaries and glossaries to support vocabulary  development activities. Classroom libraries which celebrate the multilingual and multicultural students in our program are  available in the ESL class.   The ESL teacher uses the DOK and patterns the questions after the ELA, Math and Science common core state exams.   Students receive content area instruction from monolingual teachers who incorporate ESL strategies throughout the day. All  students participate in hands-on experiments and projects, cooperative group work, and visuals to support learning and make  the content comprehensible and enrich language development. ELL students receive two periods of ELA Academic  Intervention Services per week and are encouraged to participate in our after-school and Saturday school programs. Our plan  includes individual plans to facilitate the growth of students in the modalities that they must master in order to attain  ‘Proficient’ level on the NYSESLAT and then transition into a monolingual program. Teachers consistently analyze the data to  address the academics needs of these students and provide differentiated instruction to support growth in academic  vocabulary and  written language. In addition, teachers focus on developing higher order thinking skills to enhance their  reading comprehension skills. Our targeted intervention program for the ELLs in ELA, Math, and other content areas include:   • ELA Academic Intervention Services (all language levels)   • Math Academic Intervention Services (all language levels)        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Students are evaluated in their home language short reading and writing exercises, as well as listening and speaking  activities, that will be administered about three times a year, once every two months.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The SIFE are pulled separately periodically to ensure to provide holistic support. These two students are given emergent texts  to support increased decoding and reading skills. These students are in the early production and speech emergent stage and  are encouraged to produce short phrases and focus on listening and absorbing vocabulary. Discussions are encouraged to  support listening and speaking skills using think- pair share models and previewing are encouraged. There is an emphasis on  vocabulary development and increasing written work from phrases to longer sentences. The class-work and activities are  differentiated based on student levels.   Newcomers will receive intervention and progress monitoring to review intervention needs. The instruction will focus on  vocabulary development as well as comprehension. and writing skills. The focus is on demonstrating opinions and analysis of  text. It is important improve fluency and vocabulary knowledge.   Ells receiving service from four to six years and Long term ELLs are in need of enhancing reading and written communication  skills, vocabulary development and sentence patterns. Based on the data these students need support in the reading and  writing modality.   Former Ells are provided with the support of testing acomodations for two years after testing as proficient. They continue to  receive intervention support as needed twice weekly along with their mandated peers in Math/ELA.   In order to help students make academic progress, we utilize the following practices:   • Collaborative planning between ENL and ELA teachers   • Assisting students during work periods, conferencing with students in and out of class, Informal   Assessments, and Running Records.   • Additional small group intervention sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          80      academic language.   Differentiation throughout the ELL program is done through a varied content of assignments and reading materials. Students  are given different text covering the same topic as well as varied leveled assignments. All students focus on learning academic  vocabulary, reading and comprehension skills, listening, reading and writing with understanding, and facts and details.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use various strategies and grade level materials to teach ELLs and accelerate their English development. Think-Pair- Share, small group instruction, Stand-Alone services, and individual work with teachers. Continental Press materials include  Vocabulary Links (for vocabulary development), Phonics and Word Study materials which are both age and proficiency level  appropriate. They materials are geard to vacabulary development and phonics word study for the beginner. New York ELLs by  Continental provides support in language acquisition in the four modalities with lessons on storytelling/using dialogue for  listening and speaking and informational/literacy texts for reading. The writing component includes essay writing ( descriptive,  argument and informational fact based), short responses. The Pearson Learning English Learning System is our newest addition  to help furth support our ELLs to have access to lessons based Common Core Standards. Materials used from this system  includes 6  th  -8  th   grade appropriate Keystone textbook, workbooks , and reader companion, as well as Pearson Language  Central materials for vocabulary building. This system is used primarily during the Stand-Alone ENL classes Differentiation is  used for each subgroup, SIFE, Long Term ELLs (LTE), Newcomers strategies are also used to provide individualized instruction  and support the academic levels of the students. A variety of D.I. activities provide for various ways students can indicate  learning and skill mastery. The ELLs-SWDs are supported by Ms. Taylor the ENL teacher and are provided with mandated  minutes as beginners (360 minutes), intermediate (360) and advanced (180 minutes). Software technology is used to  supplement phonics, reading comprehension, and sequencing. These materials support student understanding of academic  language and language acquisition by helping students decode and analyze texts and write about sequence of events in a story  They are supported in content area instruction for during the Stand Alone ENL and in the Integrated ENL classes which give  them the least restrictive environment.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our policy for special needs students includes:   • Ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with students’ particular needs and all services are   provided accordingly to the IEP mandates.   • Collaboration between the ESL teacher and classroom teachers   • The delivery of intervention services, after school and as part of our Saturday Academy to ensure the students can be moved  to the least restrictive environment.   The students are also pulled out for services with the general education students. The ELLs-SWD's are in Integrated Co  Teaching Classes.   Flexible programming is used to provide for maximum time spent with non disabled peers and the students are in the ICT class.  The criteria for placement is guided by the SOPM and flexible programming mandates for students with disabilities. The School  Implementation Team will begin the process of compiling information on students for review in order to provide evidence to  place students in the ICT class based on attendance, behavioral needs, academic and socio- emotional needs. It is important to  look at the class needs and inclusion of the parents in the conference on least restrictive environment. The SIT members make  recommendations to the SBST regarding flexible programming for upcoming students in preparation of the students' IEP  Meetings. The school ensures that this practice takes place by documenting team meetings and involving school  administrators and teacher leaders on the SIT team.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  After School Support/ Targeted Instruction ( ELA/Math)- offered in English - All ELLs   Small Group Instruction - Intervention Class for ELA and Math twice Weekly Offered in English - All ELLs   Extended Learning Time (ELT) - weekly math/ELA support   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          81      The targeted intervention in ELA and Math ar based on the Core Curriculum of expeditionary Learning (ELA) and CMP3 Math  which has exploration and varied practice activities leading to mastery for middle school students. The science program is  more hands on and provides for an increased amount of exploration activities which can be extended beyond the classroom.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The programming will basically remain the same.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of the programs/services will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and academic and extracurricular services in the building. The students  can participate in the Algebra Class which ends in Regents credit or the Pre-Algebra Class and Spanish Class. Students  participate in the Chance- Karate Program which is after school ( three times per week). They also participate in School Art  Program which incorporates graphic art and news print production. Students display their work in the building on the walls  which serve as an Art Gallery. The program also teaches students to use other mediums such as painting and sculpture. We  also have a STEM after school program motivates students that are interested in science careers. There is a SAT-FIT exercise  programs for students and teachers to maintain a healthy lifestyle by jogging and or walking in the gym. This takes place twice  per week. ELLs are invited to participate and the parent coordinator/language access coordinator sends letters to parents in  their preferred language.

Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Computer Lab, Laptop Carts, SmartBoards, language specific dictionaries, calculators, English and Math software programs,  translated textbooks, translated articles ) These materials are used to support the ESL and general education teachers in all  content areas to support all of the ELL subgroups. The native language materials are increasing and the ESL teacher has a  variety of materials in the pull out classroom ( Continental, Curriculum Associates and translated articles and materials are  used).       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Some classroom teachers can scaffold native language support in Spanish. Parents are supportive in working with the school  for the growing population of Arabic students ( materials, books and cultural events). Teachers bring in materials which are  culturally relevant to students to enhance their knowledge and promote a positive learning environment. it is imperative that  teachers get to know students and for building relationships and trust with families. Technology is used to deliver native  language support ( (Internet, programs and Google translate).       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ELLs are primarily adolescents that come to the school community with a variety of needs. The guidance counselor, and  teachers work collaboratively to provide social emotional supports for grades 6 - 8. The Brooklyn North Borough Field Support  Center has a wealth of resources for parents and ELLs which are provided by Youth Development. Resources divisions in all  areas of student development are provided to the parent coordinator and guidance counselor to aid in supplying the social  emotional needs of the students. Related service providers are available to provide guidance in the areas of speech and  language, physical development, occupational therapy and social work in order to aid parents and students.        15.

For example, to help them transition into middle school, content area teachers are given tips as to how to  appropriately provide scaffolds for class assignments and projects, such as breaking up an assignment into manageable  parts.  Whereas for transitioning into high school students are provided with the skills necessary and are encouraged to take  notes quickly and to jot down questions, in either English or their native language to ensure that their questions are answered.  Also content area teachers are provided with Continental Press English workbooks  to give our ELLs for additional English  support in the classroom, which may be used for independent practice, as necessary. Brooklyn North Borough Field Support  Center  has assigned staff to support the Guidance Counselor with professional development needs.      13K301 meets the professional development requirements for all teachers by providing the aforementioned services of hourly  professional learning opportunities. Records are kept for professional development activities (agendas/attendance sheets       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At our school, we value and support parental involvement, especially related to the parents of ELL students. During   Parent Teacher conferences and Orientation meeting for new ELL’s invitation letters are sent in native languages   and agenda of the meeting is also prepared in native languages. Programs for the ELL’s form an item of discussion   in the agenda for the meetings. Bilingual teachers translate at the meetings. LAP Team members and bilingual teachers are  also provide help in understanding the structure of LAB-R testing, NYSESLAT, and NYS Intermediate Level School Testing in ELA,  Math, and Science. Translation and Interpretation Services are provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ELL Parents are invited to participate in all of the parent involvement activities.  The parent involvement activities featured this  year are as follows: Curriculum Night, Parent Orientations for ELL Parents, Orientation for New Students, Family Night, Game  Night, Fitness Night, Informational Meetings, and Parent Teacher Conferences with Guest Speakers. Our ELL families are  invited to all school events, our ELL information sessions, and to visit our ESL Program so that they are aware of the  format of  the ENL program. We also plan and conduct parental engagement activities related to ARIS and literacy to attract the  participation of ELL families.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    To assess the litearcy skills of the ELL's Ms. McCormick, ESL teacher uses Fountas and Pinnell to determine their reading levels.   The data assists in providing meaningful insights to how the students can decode the language. However, it does   not assist with the comprehension of what was read. Ms.McCormick, ESL teacher along side with the ELA teachers collaborate and  work on vocabulary scaffolding. The instructional plan is determined through thorough analysis of the students reading level,  comprehension level and student critical thinking and analysis skills. The plan is then tailored to included various inputs and  outputs based on group need.   The data reveals the students have an excellent command on BICs communication and have difficulties in the   reading and writing comprehension. Students still need to improve CALP.   The patterns across the NYSELAT modalities affect instructional decision school wide because it is a noted trend   school wide, that reading comprehension and writing are an overall need. The school had addressed this issue   through various initiatives to promote reading and writing throughout the ELL population as well as the rest of the   school.   In the Free Standing ESL program, the students are moderately proficient in speaking    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          84                       and listening but are below proficiency in reading and writing as evidenced by the daily interactions of Ms. Taylor, ESL   teacher.           2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          86                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Satellite East MS 301                                                                              School DBN: 13K301  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the beginning of each academic year any new students entering the New York City school system, specifially  MS 301-Satellite East for the first time completes the HLIS form as a part of their Registration packet. On Part 3 of  the HLIS the parent indicates their preferred language(s) for oral and written communications with the school and  teachers. Also a Parent Survey and the DOE Blue Cards are distributed to every students home inquiring about  preferred oral and written language for their communications. Of the 167 students this year, parents speaking  Spanish, Bengali, and Fulani have asked for translation of written documents.All DOE communications (HLIS,  Parent Brouchures, Entitlement letters, Non-Entitlement letters, Continued Enttlement , ect) already come  translated and are provided in the appropriate and requested languages. Immediate oral translation is available  from pedagogical and non-pedagogical staff members in Spanish, and Arabic for any parent calling in, or coming in  for information about their child. Additional ways to collect data to support parent communication are as follows:  ATS report of preferred languages, parent surveys, and teacher surveys (collect by class).        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          88       2.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school will fulfull parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services by posting a  Welcome poster in a visible area in the Main Office and Guidance Counselor's office, as well as other various main  points in the school. All parents of ELLs will be notified of their rights, as well as how they pertain to their child's  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          90      education, in a letter format. A record will be kept of which parents have received this information to ensure that all  parents are aware of their rights. Parents will be invited to attend the PD given to staff on the resources available for  native language access. All notification documents are available at the Translation and Interpretation Unit intranet  site.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Surveys will be periodically sent out throughout the year in order to maintain up-to-date information on the needs of  our English Language Learners (ELLs). Non-native English speakers will always have the option to request that any  correspondance sent from the school be written in their native language. In addition, they will always be given the  option prior to all meetings to have an interpreter, either on site or over the phone, during all face-to-face meetings.  These surveys also help to anticipate the needs of our ELLs and non-native English speaking parents. The school  administration with schedule a focus group of parents inclusive of all culture and languages represented in the school  to gather feedback and best practices.         2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          91
