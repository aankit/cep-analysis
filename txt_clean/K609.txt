This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice seeks to prepare young women for success in college and career. We  provide an academically rigorous curriculum that reflects the core set of knowledge and skills necessary for admission  to the nation’s top universities while honing necessary skills that will prepare them for their post-secondary careers.  Embracing the theme of empowering women, we develop our students into critical thinkers who rely on evidence,  logic and sound reasoning to formulate ideas and to support them. These critical thinking skills will serve them well in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      any field they eventually choose to pursue. Our school community, with its committed staff, allows adolescents to  transition into adulthood in an environment which supports emotional, physical and intellectual growth.               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice (UASCJ) is an all-girls’, grades 6-12 public school located in Boro Park,  Brooklyn. This is the 12 th year of our school’s existence and our 12 th grade will be our sixth graduating class. The  mission of our school is to provide our students with the learning opportunities that will allow them to acquire the  knowledge and skills necessary for college and career. We currently have 554 students across the seven grades, and  our diverse demographic make-up is: 45% Asian, 19% Black, 19% Hispanic, 13% White and 1% Hawaiian/PI. Our  students come from all over Brooklyn, and a few students come from the outer boroughs.   We have established partnerships with a number of organizations that allow us to provide students with various  enrichment opportunities including: College Now – City Tech, Exploring the Arts, Sponsors for Educational  Opportunity (SEO), Minds Matters, Opportunity Network and Urban Assembly. Of great importance to our school are  the summer enrichment opportunities we secure for our students. These include Camp Fuller, Steve’s Camp, and  Smack Mellon Arts Camp . We have also secured positive relationships with corporate partners such as Crowell and  Moring Law Firm, NYPD's Explorer Program and PAL, and more recently, Barclays Bank.    Our strengths lie primarily in two areas. Instructionally, we have spent many years establishing and refining our  critical thinking/ literacy framework that includes close reading, critical discussion and writing for argument. This  framework has given us a structure through which to introduce rigorous texts and concepts while developing our  students’ critical thinking and reasoning skills. For the coming school year, we are incorporating a research writing  component in our core classes from grades 6-12 to further prepare our students for college. We have also expanded a  benchmark assessment system to better track student progress on specific instructional goals. Using UDL (Universal  Design for Learning) principles, teachers provide students with the specific supports they need. These approaches  have contributed to our above average results on state exams in middle school as compared to the city and a 92%  graduation rate for the class of 2018. Among our 79 graduates, 45% graduated with an Advanced Regents diploma  and/or with Honors while 75% graduated college-ready.   College readiness is our second area of strength. With our college counselor, we have developed a 4-year curriculum  that prepares students to understand what they need to accomplish in order to graduate high school and how to  apply to college. The college application process is a full-school process, with teachers supporting students not only in  writing high-quality personal statements but also in editing students' essays and preparing them for interviews. It is  also important to note that the college counselor is the primary point person for all student enrichment activities as  we believe that student enrichment – both after school and during the summer – is essential to college readiness. All  Seniors are enrolled in a credit-bearing College Readiness class where they are provided with instructional support for  their college essays as well as support on managing the FAFSA process. In addition, we have partnered with College  Access for All for both middle school and high school to increase college awareness and readiness throughout the  school.   To further our students' readiness for college and career, we currently offer five Advanced Placement courses  including AP Calculus, AP US History, AP English Lit, AP Environmental Science and AP Spanish. In conjunction with the  Urban Assembly Support Network, we are piloting a CDOS program to ensure all our students learn critical and  necessary career skills. We are also embedding career readiness programs in our seventh grade and 12th grade  classes so that students are well prepared for post-secondary success.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We endeavor to provide our students a well-rounded liberal arts education with a strong focus on argumentative  writing and the use of evidence to support thoughts and ideas so they can make informative decisions and advocate  for themselves as they prepare for adulthood.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our English Language Learners, students with IEPs, native language speakers and general education students are all  held to the same high standards. To better support their needs, we offer a small-group English class for our beginner  ELLs in 9th, 10th and 11th grades. We also offer one elective class for our middle school ELL beginners and two  elective classes for our high school ELL beginners, where students are provided with intensive English Language  acquisition instruction.   Students with IEPs are supported through various co-teaching models with instruction that includes Universal Design  for Learning practices. We also provide AIS services for all eligible students. We will continue to provide CDOS classes  that include career training to better meet their needs to succeed beyond the classroom. We are also using the  Wilson's Reading Program in middle school to to better target our neediest learners.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the School Quality Guide, In 2017-2018 we scored highest on Rigorous instruction where we earned a  score of 4.36 which was significantly higher when compared to the District-wide (+0.57) and Citywide (+0.62)  averages. Our Common Core shifts in literacy, particularly, have enabled students to progress on to the next grade as  evidenced by a score of 4.41 in Common Core Shifts in Literacy as compared with the District-wide average (+1%) and  Citywide Average (5%) Our 92% graduation rate supports the fact that we have a rigorous curriculum that promotes  student engagement and success. AccordiWe will continue to enhance teacher collaboration so that best practices  can be shared to better support the Common Core Shifts in Social Studies, Math and Science. To support this effort,  we will continue to use our two Model Teachers and one Peer Collaborative Teacher as resources who will open their  classrooms as labs and support the Professional Development of our teachers.    We will use department meeting time to focus on two initiatives or areas of focus for the year; using formative  assessment to drive instruction and set student goals and incorporating research writing in English, Social Studies and  Science classes.    Also, though we scored well overall on the school quality guide for Rigorous Instruction, our least positive was on  Common Core Shifts in Math (84%), therefore we have teamed up with the Urban Assembly Middle School Math  Support program for the coming school year as well as AP for All to refine curricula so that it is vertically aligned.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K609   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   556   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths: Our students use our critical thinking framework – close reading, critical discussion and writing for  argument – across the four major subjects (grades 6-12) to engage with complex texts in English, social studies and  science and with complex concepts in math. Because our critical thinking framework is aligned with the Common Core  Standards, our proficiency rates by eighth grade were 64.62% in ELA and 39.4% in math for 2017-2018 school year  which are above the city average. Our Regents pass rates were as follows: ELA-80%, Global and Geography-80%, US  History-92%, Algebra-80%, Algebra II-79%, Geometry-40%, Living Environment-59% and Chemistry-40 %. This year, we  had a 92% Graduation rate in high school, with 43% graduating with honors or an advanced regents diploma.      Needs assessment: While our success, particularly in the Humanities, is cause for celebration, we need to  continuously examine our practices by increasing the rigor of the daily objectives and allowing students to problem  solve. Teachers will conduct inter-visitations to provide feedback using the lens of rigorous objectives that allow  students to problem solve and discover relationships among concepts. Departments will also use student work to  address gaps in understanding and continue to refine curricula so that it is vertically aligned.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, we will deepen rigor of our longitudinal literacy framework and vertical math scope and sequence across  grade levels as evidenced by a 2% increase in students performing as proficient on middle school math summative  assessments, so in grade 6 from 30% to 32%, in grade 7 from 39% to 41% and in grade 8 from 34% to 36% and a 2%  increase in students meeting college readiness benchmarks in both ELA and Math Regents from 75% to 77%.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Strengths: In conjunction with our after school Community Based Organization (CBO), Neighborhood Improvement  Association (NIA), our middle school students are offered homework help and are immersed in enrichment activities  that challenge them mentally, physically and artistically. Our high school has several clubs that have helped establish a  classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported and challenged by their teachers and peers. These  clubs include Student Council, Peer Mediation, Good Will, and Senior Activities and are rooted in community service,  service to school, and enriching the school experience with social activities. We also have monthly celebratory  gatherings where students are acknowledged for their academic and social-emotional successes. The effects of this  nurturing and supportive environment can be seen in our high school graduation rate which, over the past 5 years, is  at 93% as well as in our school quality guide where 95% of students agree or strongly agree that they feel safe in their  classes. This year we are focusing on giving all our students an opportunity to visit a college campus and infusing  career readiness skills into our curriculum.      Need: Though the school provides opportunities for enrichment and has many systems and structures in place to  support students to succeed in high school and beyond, our school’s chronically absent rate for middle school is 18%  and 33% for high school for a combined average of 25.5%.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths: During the 2017-2018 school year we asked teachers to better outline the supports given in co-taught  classrooms which enabled more precise use of UDLstrategies and offered the Principal and instructional Assistant  Principal a clearer understanding of the scaffolds being provided.    The sharing of best practices was encouraged and supported by Administration and the Peer Collaborative Teacher  through in-house and outside Professional Development, inter-visitation of classrooms and a sharing of best practices.   In response to teacher feedback, we allotted more co-planning time during the professional development hours in  school and on professional development days in June. Due to this, according to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide,  91% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that their professional development experiences included opportunities to  work productively with colleagues in their school.   Need: According to our 2017-2018 School Quality Guide under the heading, Collaborative Teachers, 89% of teachers  agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences had been sustained and  coherently focused, rather than short-term and unrelated. This is an increase of 6% from the year before. To further  enhance our teachers' professional learning opportunities, our Peer Collaborative Teacher will survey teachers on  professional development interests and create a professional learning calendar that incorporates their needs.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In 2014-215, we worked closely with Lauren Kraus from the Office of Teacher Recruitment and Quality on strategies  to improve hiring highly qualified teachers. Through this work, we have developed a comprehensive interview process  including standardized questions, reference checks, and demo lessons when possible. We also attend Borough-wide  and City-wide hiring fairs and advertise vacancies on Open Market and New Teacher Finder.   Furthermore, to increase retention we are;   a) providing Mentors to new teachers and teaching buddies to teachers new to our school but not new to teaching.  We also believe that by providing teachers a highly structured, nurturing school environment as well as opportunities  for professional growth, our teachers will seek to stay at UASCJ.   b) we have added two Model Teachers and one Peer Collaborative Teacher to work closely with our teachers so they  have a clear understanding of effective teaching practices as measured by the Danielson Rubric. These teachers will  also open their classrooms to new teachers so they can view best practices. By setting clear expectations for teaching  and learning through modeling and offering professional development sessions aligned with our school's instructional  focus, we hope to minimize ambiguity and misunderstandings.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our professional development opportunities include:   Co-Planning time for our co-taught classroom teachers (40 different pairs) for 35 minutes on Monday and 30 minutes  on Tuesday   ● Department Teams who meet weekly for 45 minutes and includes all teachers. Teams work together to refine  curricula so that it is vertically aligned, they look at students work to analyze trends and gaps in understanding, they  look at formative assessment data to guide their instruction and help students create goals, and they conduct inter- visitations to provide feedback on pedagogical practices.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● Grade Teams who meet for 40 minutes each week and analyze trends in student attendance and scholarship  reports   ● Since last year, we have two model teachers whose classrooms will be used as lab classrooms for their peers where  they will get a chance to see best practices in action. We also have a Peer Collaborative Teacher who will help create  and implement our differentiated professional development series.   ● Differentiated Professional Development sessions on Mondays for 40 minutes broken into topics based on needs  asessment and teacher survey responses.   ● Whole staff PD as needed. We also have three full day Professional Development sessions–November 7, January 29  and June 7 – that allow us to delve more deeply into realizing our goals.

A Google document is used to track the work done during this time.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice , in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.          School-Parent Compact (SPC)             The Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school communi   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school.

We strongly believe that reading and writing  skills are imperative for academic success. Our program is designed to use an appropriate skill- based curriculum that will allow our ELLs to develop their language skills in a variety of  academic contents. The curriculum will be adapted to the Common Core ELA standards. Our  focus on reading will include a variety of non-fiction texts that will provide an opportunity for  students to build their skills. This includes acquiring the use of academic vocabulary, close  readings, identifying important concepts and events, and building background knowledge. Our  writing component will develop our ELLs’ skills in non-fiction pre-writing activities, paragraph  development, and the practice of revising. Overall, our goal for the program is for students to  significantly improve their academic reading and writing skills to support them in their content  classes and formal New York State assessments.    The ENL team designed the curriculum based on data from the NYSESLAT 2017 and 2018. In  addition to NYSESLAT data, the team analyzed trends from the middle school ELA exam (for  our ELLs that qualified to sit for it) and the ELA Common Core Regents for our grades 9-12  students.     Our supplemental program will take place after school on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays  starting November 30, 2018-January 23, 2019. The program will resume on the same days after  school from April 19-June 7, 2019.   The program will take place between 3:00pm - 4:15pm. Our high school ELL students will  participate inNYSESLAT Prep as well as  Regents Prep courses which may include Algebra,  Geometry, Living Environment, Chemistry, Global History and US History. Our middle school  ELLs will participate in ELA, math and NYSESLAT prep for to support their content classes and  New York State exams.     While all ELLs will be grouped together, our supplemental program will focus on differentiation  and modifications for two subgroups of ELL students in grades 6-12. Students will be recognized  as entering/emerging or transitioning/expanding. Students will be identified based on their  designated NYSESLAT score, or if they are a new student, the NYISTELL and/or the Spanish  Lab-R.  Our program provides one hundred percent of instruction in English, however,  home  language support will be included in lessons for students at all NYSESLAT/NYISTELL levels.  For example, the ENL team will explicitly teach students that are literate in their native language  how to use the New York State glossaries and word to word dictionaries that our school has  purchased. Our materials to support these program will include a wide variety of resources, using  non-fiction texts from credible reading sites, such as NewsELA, New York Times (student  edition) and Read Works. We selected these examples to highlight because the lexile level can be  adjusted to match the reading levels of students (Fountas and Pinnell). Additionally,  materials included will be non-fiction leveled texts such as National Geographic for Kids, Write  Time (Time Magazine for Kids),  and Scholastic Non-Fiction passages.

On Saturday March 3, 2019 from 10:00am-1:00pm we  will hold a mother/daughter Arts and Beauty Day. During this activity, mothers and daughters   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    will have a chance to present an artistic skill from their native country and have an opportunity to  teach others. This provides our UASCJ mothers of ELLs to take part in a cultural appreciation  activity. On March 23, 2019 and March 30, 2019  from 9:00am-12:00pm, the ENL teachers will  host two sessions of Saturday English Language classes for parents of ELLs.   Topics covered will include themes of common vocabulary that will benefit our parents in  everyday life. This includes, a family unit, directions, transportation and medical. During the  spring semester, we will incorporate grammar and an emphasis on reading and writing. The last  hour of each session will be dedicated to teaching and helping the parents use our school based  technology systems. This includes how to access Jupiter Grades to check their daughter’s daily  assignments and homework. Additionally, we will help parents set up a gmail account and have  parents practice writing teachers emails. We will review a list of helpful questions parents can  ask via email or during parent- teacher conferences.     Information for Saturday Parental Engagement Activities will be provided on an informational  flyer that is translated into Spanish, Urdu, Bangla, Russian and Arabic. Additionally, using  translation services, we will call the parents of ELLs to inform them of the events and document  on a Parent Contact Log saved on Google Drive.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     Our primary assessment tool our school uses to assess early literacy skills is Degrees of Reading Power, also known as the DRP.  We complete this assessment three times throughout the school year. The DRP provides teachers with a measure of how well  students have the ability to process and comprehend increasingly more complex test. The DRP also provides students with a  lexile range for texts that they can read independently or with the help of the teacher. In addition to the DRP exam, the middle  school ELLs are assessed with Fountas and Pinnell running records and the high school uses Gates/McLeod assessment.      The literacy data we have collected has served as an essential tool around instructional planning. Baseline goals have been set  that each ELL student will grow at least 1.5 - 2 years in their reading level. We decided this is a practical, yet critical goal for the  students as they develop their reading skills while acquiring English. One way that instructional planning has been impacted is  that teachers are consistently implementing reading strategies in all subject areas. Our school applies a close reading practice   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      which allows students to use various reading strategies to further their comprehension. This may include chunking the text,  annotations and using context clues. After close reading, students participate in a critical discussion, which leads to an  argumentative writing piece. This cyclical routine has provided students with consistent opportunities to use reading strategies  to further their comprehension of the text while developing their writing skills.      If our ELLs do not reach their goals and/or demonstrate growth on their assessments, we incorporate the Wilsons Reading  System (Just Words)  and/or the Great Leaps program during an elective class. Additionally, for the 2017-2018 school year, we  have added the Just Words Program as an elective option for both middle school and high school.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) dates planned and placed on the school calendar before the school year begins  to ensure we allocated the proper amount of time for this particular assessment. For example, for the 2017-2018 school year,  students took the first round of the DRP by September 15th, 2017.  We have one week windows established for teachers to  administer the exam. Additionally, teachers  discuss and analyze literacy data in Department and Grade teams, which meet on  Mondays afternoons throughout the school year. Also, we have elective periods designed to implement our programs  mentioned in the above question.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  AT UASCJ, we evaluate the success of our program based on the results of New York State assessments, such as the NYSESLAT.  Additionally, we evaluate individual student achievement according to growth in content areas and results on summative  content and English assessments. Based on the NYSESLAT scores from the 2016-2017 school year, 22.4% of ELLs in grades 6-12  tested out of our ENL program at a commanding level. The results show that our program continues to be successful despite  the change in the rigorous demands of the assessment, including alignment with the Common Core standards. Also, the data  shows that all ELLs from 2016-2017 that entered our school at an entering or emerging level moved at least one or more levels  and tested at a higher level, at the transitioning or expanding level. The data shows that all of our students made gains, we did  not have any students score at a lower level than they were already at.  This data ensures that our program is successful at  moving ELLs at all levels. Additionally, all of our ELLS participate in New York City MOSL assessments and Content Benchmarks  in their content classes. MOSL and Benchmark data is tracked by department which skills our students have mastered or need  further supports.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered, the ENL team meets during their department time to analyze the trends. The team  creates spreadsheets in Google Drive to share with administration and teachers. The team analyzes NYSESLAT trends and  monitors student growth from the previous years. In addition to NYSESLAT data, during department time, the ENL team  monitors benchmark exams and tracks growth over time in all content areas.  Based on this data, the ENL team can then  discuss how to best support our ELLs in their content courses and plan professional development for the staff.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      According to the outcome of assessments and data patterns, each grade has a unique profile based on the results of the  NYSESLAT AND NYSITELL scores, as well as content area data. For the 2017-2018 school year, we have adjusted our ELL  program to ensure our students' needs are being met. We hired an additional ENL teacher to support our ELLs in the content  areas that our data shows students need further support. For example,  due to a trend in low math state test scores, our  ELLs will now have an ENL certified co-teacher in middle school math classes. Additionally, based on  the NYC MOSL assessments, the former 7th grade middle school ELLs demonstrated the need for extra support in social   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         studies. As a result, we now have an ENL teacher with this particular class in 8th grade social studies to support their needs. In  the high school, our data particularly showed that our students struggled most as a result of the Global History and United  States History Regents exams. We adjusted ENL teacher schedules this year to accommodate further supports and for the  current school year, there will be an ENL co-teacher placed in Global 9, Global 10 and U.S. 11. As the year progresses, we will  continue to use the outcome of assessments to evaluate our ELL programs.            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Based on this data, we determine our ENL servicing needs. Before the school year begins, the ENL team meets with  administration to begin to plan for ENL programming. Using the most recent NYSESLAT data, we individually look at each  student and their level to determine how many minutes and in what capacity they will be serviced (ex: self-contained and/or  co-teaching). We determine how many minutes our students require of ENL servicing based on the CR Part 154 New York State  agreement. Once we determine this, administration places the ENL teacher in both self-contained and co-teaching classrooms  accordingly. We keep track ENL services and student minutes in a Google Doc spread sheet and adjust minutes as necessary.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      Our school offers an ENL program that is implemented as per CR Part 154.2 with one hundred percent of instruction  in English with native language support built into the program. In the middle school, in each grade (6-8) has one  cohort of ELLs ( at heterogeneous levels) that travel together throughout the day. They attend all content and  electives courses as a group. This model provides the ENL teachers, Ms. Ortiz and Ms. Casey an opportunity to co- teach, and implement a stand-alone model as well as integrated for the students appropriately based on mandated  NYS minutes. In the high school, students do not travel in cohorts, however, all ELLs receive Mr. Carroll or Ms.  Cojocarita as a co-teacher in their grade level ELA class. Additionally, entering, emerging and transitioning students in  high school receive an extra .5 elective of stand alone ENL with Mr. Carroll or Ms. Cojocarita.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              As per the CR-Part 154 mandate, our school ensures that the mandated number of minutes is provided according to NYSESLAT  proficiency levels. In middle school, ELL students that scored at a entering or emerging level are group to receive a "beginner"  course led by Ms. Ortiz which provides students with ENL self-contained for 360 minutes a week. Additionally, all ELL students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      at all levels in the middle school will receive integrated ENL for a minimum of 180 minutes a week. The entering and emerging  students will receive 360 total minutes of ENL a week and the transitioning and expanding students will receive 180 minutes a  week. Our F-ELLs will be grouped in the middle school ELL cohort, which will allow for our F-ELLs to receive 180 minutes of  services a week.      As per the CR-Part 154 mandate, in the high school, our entering level students receive a total of 540 minutes. Everyday,  students at this level receive 2 period of self-contained ENL (by Mr. Carroll or Ms. Cojocarita),  in addition to  1 period of  integrated ENL with Mr. Carroll or Ms. Cojocarita. Our emerging students also receive 1 period of ENL (in a self-contained class  with the entering students) and 1 unit of integrated ELA. The transitioning students receive a total of 180 minutes per week,  serviced fully by integrated ENL. Similar to the transitioning students, the expanding students also receive integrated ENL for  180 minutes per week. As stated, all integrated ENL classes are co-taught by ENL teacher Mr. Carroll or Ms. Cojocarita. Our F- ELLs are grouped with the ELLs in their ELA class, which allows our F-ELLs to continue to receive services, which amounts to  180 a week.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All content area instruction is delivered in English, except our entering and emerging students receive modified material,  which sometimes may be translated into their native language. We do this specifically for the students that are pre-literate in  English. This helps nurture the natural process of English language acquisition. We use online translators such a Google  translate to do this. In addition, we have help from Spanish, Bengali and Urdu speaking paraprofessionals in our school. As the  students continue through our program and they develop stronger English literacy skills, we begin to scaffold these  assignments to include more English.      Our transitioning and expanding students do not receive translated assignments, however, we will translate if necessary to  demonstrate instruction and comprehension. Additionally, these students develop their native language development by  translating their notes and vocabulary. Our school uses these methods to foster native language development while meeting  the rigorous demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, which are implemented into daily lessons, assignments and  homework. Also, during our lunch period, former ELL high school students volunteer to tutor ELLs in their native language.  Typically, this includes reviewing class material, practicing problems and developing skills that will transfer to English. This is an  instrumental component that allows our ELL community to come together and foster their native language while developing  Common Core skills.     Additionally, all ELLs have the option to use the New York State Bilingual Glossaries in their content classes. The ENL teachers  print these before the start of the school year and work with teachers and students to show them how use them  appropriately.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   When an ELL enters our school as a first time admit, we administer the Literacy Evaluation for Newcomer SIFE (LENS). This  assessment helps determine and measure the home-language literacy skills that students have when they enter our school.  This data provides us information about their range of skills in literacy and math. Additionally, our students are evaluated in  their native language throughout the year with the assistance of our staff. This includes an Urdu, Bengali and Spanish speaking  paraprofessionals. Also, our technology teacher is fluent in Arabic and French.    It is important to note that every teacher knows the level and native language of the ELLs in our school. This information was  provided for teachers at an ENL PD before school started and it is shared in a Google Doc. At weekly grade team meetings,  teachers determine the different ways native language support can be provided to individual students. For example, all  beginner ELLs receive translated class work, projects and homework. We recognize that these students need their native  language to understand the content while acquiring English. Our intermediate and advanced students receive less translated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      instructional material on a daily basis. However, teachers encourage these students to take notes in both languages and write  in the language of their choice. If a student chooses their native language, we provide translation services. Additionally, all ELL  students are encouraged to read in their native language during Silent Sustained Reading. Our school provides an ample  amount of fiction and non-fiction texts in multiple languages for the teachers and students. This includes bilingual dictionaries  so that our students can translate vocabulary from their native language to English.              5.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       A.  Our instructional plan for SIFE students begins with the LENS evaluation in their native language to determine how SIFE has  impacted their education and discuss how our school can meet their needs. This help begins the process of understanding the  needs of the individual student. If the student is a newcomer, or has had limited education, we will pair them with another  student that speaks their native language. This allows for the SIFE student to learn directions and the culture of the school. If  necessary, depending on the level of the NYISTELL exam, the SIFE student may become part of a newcomer group (see below).      B. Our instructional plan for newcomers involves these students becoming involved in the newcomer group, led by Ms. Ortiz.  This group meets twice a week for a period and they explore the culture of the school, their community and New York City.  The group takes two cultural field trips to discuss adjustments to living in New York City. Lessons are created to help acclimate  the students to the United States and provide them with structures and routines for them to become successful students at  UASCJ.      C. Our plan for developing students is to implement extended academic supports that are founded by using our Title III funds  to create a Saturday Academy taught by Ms. Ortiz and Mr. Carroll. The focus of the Saturday Academy is to further develop  reading and writing skills through Common Core Standards. While we invite all ELLs to participate, we strongly encourage  these students to attend Saturday Academy because often these students are in the process of developing their academic  language. This program provides students with an opportunity to focus on acquiring and applying tier 2 and 3 vocabulary  words to their reading and writing assignments. When lessons are designed, teachers confirm that there is an entry point for  developing students to access the content of the lesson. Without an entry point, these students often miss the objective and  therefore can’t comprehend the main ideas. Typically, this is a direct result of language overload without access to the lesson.  Some example of differentiated instruction include the use of media, such as video clips, turn and talk (use of native language),  filling out the K&W of a KWL chart or a quick write that is connected to the previous lesson.      D. Our plan for long-term students is to focus and receive individualized plans for learning. Often, we find our long-term  students need more support in reading and writing. We encourage these students to attend Saturday Academy to continue to  develop their skills. Also, during pull-out sessions, the ENL teacher can focus on specific skills that a student may be struggling  with. Our goal for long-term students is to discover what is preventing them from testing at proficiency level and work on that  specific area of need.         E. Our plan for former ELLs is to provide the mandated service minutes as per the CR- Part154. ENL teachers will continue to  provide services and accommodations as well as monitor their growth for up to two additional years. Our schools ensures  proper scheduling so these students are in a cohort with other ELLs (in grades 6-8) and an ELA/ENL class so that they can  receive the benefits of having co-teacher and extra support in the classroom that provides accommodations.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      We have various instructional strategies and grade-level materials that our teachers of ELL-SWD’s use to provide access to  academic content areas and accelerate English language development. We have 22 ELLs that have classifications of SWD. The  ESL and Dean of Special Education Services, Ms. Alicia Escobar determine the specific needs of each child to determine (based  on their IEP) what material is most appropriate. Currently, under the guidance of Ms. Escobar and the special education  teachers, we have established for students to develop their reading and fluency skills using Great Leaps and Wilson Reading  Program led by Special Education certified teacher Heather Clarke and Amanda Cardone. Also, in order to support their writing  assignments, students complete pre-writing activities to provide them with scaffolds and modifications that develop their  language acquisition while meeting the needs of their IEPs. Grade-level materials include appropriate leveled lexile text from  non-fiction NEWS ELA, National Geographic, and ReadWorks. When, and if appropriate, such materials are translated into  native language.        Additionally, several of our ELLs-SWDs receive speech services. The speech teacher, Brandy Mac combines both standalone  and integrated models to service the ELL students. She meets weekly with the teachers to further modify curriculum. Also, she  works with the students out to focus on specific skills for individual students, this includes phonetics, subject-verb agreement,  etc.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     Our ELLs-SWD’s are always in the least restrictive environment, as all students are in heterogeneous classes with general  education native English speaking students with the exception of the stand alone entering/emerging course. ELL-SWD’s receive  additional instruction through integrated models to meet their diverse needs. Schedules are designed around student needs so  that we are able to provide them with the necessary curricular and instructional support. Scheduling is overseen by Sage  Norman, the assistant principal, and Alicia Escobar, our Special Education Coordinator, to ensure our ELLs with SWDs are on  track to achieve their IEP while obtaining language proficiency. All ENL teachers are included in the IEP goal planning to ensure  that language goals are incorporated.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     In Grades 6-8, our ELL students are scheduled into a heterogeneous cohort with native English speakers, which includes  general education native English speaking students. Ms. Ortiz and Ms. Casey are responsible for providing modifications and  instructional support to the ELLs in this cohort in all core content areas. Before school begins, a schedule is created and  organized for teachers to send her the lessons ahead of time, which allows her to provide modifications or alternate  assignments, especially for the beginners.      Some examples include, In math, the notes are already printed off a powerpoint slide for our ELLs students so that they can  spend more time problem solving and less time worrying about note-taking. Also, lessons are often presented on Educreations  (video), which allows our ELLs to pause and restart the lesson at their own pace. Also, quizzes and exams that include word  problems are translated into their native language so that students can demonstrate their mathematical skills rather than  language skills. In social studies, our ELLs keep a separate vocabulary glossary list of common Tier 2/3 words that are used in  this course.  They translate these words into their native language and if necessary, they are allowed to refer to it during  essays and exams. Also, DBQ’s are translated for beginner/intermediate students and they use a DBQ graphic organizer to  scaffold the information. In science, all ELLs use vocabulary sheets that require students to write down the word, translate it,  and provide an image. Also, if the class is reading a non-fiction article,  ELL students receive differentiated readings with  modified texts at their appropriate lexile reading level (often modified from the website NEWSELA).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         In the high school, since our ELL students are not scheduled into cohorts, except in ELA, Mr. Carroll or Ms. Cojocarita (ENL  teachers) supports their courses by co-teaching alongside with the ELA teacher in grades 9-12. In order to further support  content areas, Mr. Carroll pushes into 10  th   grade Global and 11th grade United States history, twice a week, to co-teach,  modify and work closely with ELLs in social studies. Also, Mr. Carroll works with the high school science and math teachers  during specific co-planning time provided by the principal.  In math, Mr. Carroll supports the ELLs by working with the math  teachers to create daily printed notes (which may include translations) and Educreation videos. In science, ELLs are supported  by receiving modified readings based on their designed reading levels.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?         One new program that we implemented in the 2016-2017 school year that we plan to keep is our ENL Saturday School  Academy.  Our data trends from the Degrees of Reading Power assessment show us that nearly all of our ELLs are reading  below grade, which is also impacting their ability to write academically. As a result, we created a special Saturday School  program for our ELLs (at all levels) to practice reading and writing strategies.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.     ELLs at UASCJ are fully integrated into the school and participate in all school and after school activities as part of the student  body. All ELLs are actively encouraged to get involved in extracurricular activities at our school. For example, our middle school  has a partnership with the NIA Community Services Network, which provides academic and enrichment after school clubs that  take place Monday-Friday from 3:00pm - 5:30pm. We ensure that the parents and guardians of our ELLs receive information  about NIA in their preferred language, which encourages enrollment. Additionally, many of our high school ELLs are active  members of our Student Council, Cheer leading team and Track team. In addition to after school, ELLs are also afforded an  opportunity to attend Saturday school. Ms. Ortiz and Mr. Carroll provide academic support on Saturdays throughout the  school year and our ELLs attend to receive additional academic English language instruction and homework support. This  program runs during the fall and spring semester for 10 sessions from 9am-12pm.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     Ms. Ortiz, Mr. Carroll, Ms. Casey and Ms. Cojocarita work with the content area teachers to determine which instructional  materials and resources should be used to support ELLs. In the middle school, the teachers and students have access to use  SuccessMaker by Pearson. This digital program provides teachers and students with a digital curriculum which includes lessons  and assignments based on individual student instructional levels determined by diagnostic exams. SuccessMaker is help for all  of our ELLs, however we find that it specifically benefits our SIFE students by providing supplemental lessons and activities  which meet their specific needs. For example, SuccessMaker has helped our SIFE students learn the math basics of addition,  subtraction, multiplication and division.      In math and science, the content teachers incorporate video lessons on the IPAD through the program Educreations. This  program allows the teacher to create and review lessons that students can watch and work at their own pace. Teachers of all  content areas have incorporated Plicker and/or Kahoot, which is an application to help students track and monitor checks for  understanding. This program helps our ELLs engage in the lesson, participate and assess themselves without feeling self- conscious. Teachers also support ELLs with access to Khan Academy video lessons which can also be used at home. The ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      teachers provide professional development opportunities to show teachers how students can watch the videos in their native  language, which reinforces the content while developing their first language. Teachers also use the literacy based website  NEWSELA to provide students with non-fiction articles that provide students with an opportunity to read the same article that  is modified based on their individual lexile level.       Other instructional materials include copies of the NYS language glossaries and teacher generated vocabulary lists that  students keep in their binders that include key vocabulary words along with translations.            13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      While our ENL program teaches content in English, native language support is supported and implemented into ENL and  content lessons. If a student is entering or emerging, teachers provide lesson translations for students that are pre-literate in  English but have literacy skills in their native language. Generally, Google translate is used along with the various keyboards of  Arabic, Urdu and Bengali. During group work, teachers purposefully group students so that they have an opportunity to speak  and learn in their native language with their peers. Teachers also encourage students to take notes or translate their notes into  their native language to help reinforce concepts.     Aside from the NYS language glossaries, our school also purchases fiction and non-fiction books in Spanish, Arabic, Urdu,  Bengali and Russian for our ELL and F-ELL students. Often, teachers use these books for supplemental material in content  courses.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.       Our school regularly evaluates our resources to determine that they are age and grade level appropriate, including resources  for students that may be well below grade level. The ENL teachers work with content teachers and service providers for our  ELLs that receive IEP or counseling services. Resources are evaluated to ensure that they are targeted for students in grades 6- 12.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    UASCJ shares a co-location with the Montauk School (J.H.S. 223).  Our school operates on the fourth and half of third floor,  which we share with Montauk. We have our own gym, computer lab and several resource spaces. We share the auditorium  and library. Administration works together to coordinate efforts to ensure that all students, including ELLs needs are met.  Once a month, administration from both schools meet to discuss builidng logistics to ensure our students have access to our  shared spaces.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      Newly enrolled ELL students are invited to attend a welcome student orientation that takes place before the beginning of the  school year. The ENL teachers are present and an active participant of the orientation, often running a specific session for  parents of ENL students. Also, the orientation includes getting to you know activities amongst students and staff, a tour of the  school and an informational session for parents (school staff fill in as translators). We believe this orientation fosters a warm,  inviting atmosphere for our ELLs to adjust. If an ELL enrolls mid-year, they are paired with a buddy that is in their grade and  speaks the same native language. Guided by Ms. Ortiz, Mr. Carroll, Ms. Casey or Ms. Cojocarita the buddy and new student  tour the school and the buddy makes sure any questions are answered and that they feel comfortable for the first few weeks  of adjusting to our school.  Our school guidance counselor, Natalie Cazeau also checks in with all newly enrolled ELLs to ensure   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         that their adjustment is going well and to determine if they need any further supports, such as small group counseling.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       In middle school, there are currently no language electives offered for all students. In high school, Spanish is offered to all  students, including ELLs.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   Our school offers both in-house and outside professional development opportunities to ensure our ELL staff has access to  professional development and learning the best practices for teaching and working with English Language Learners. Our school  secretary, Aretha Jones attends borough-wide training sessions to become familiarized with ELL compliance and the important  ATS reports that need to be updated or checked.  Additionally, our Parent Coordinator, Cristina Bonet attends training sessions  and workshops related to ELLs. For example, Ms. Bonet attend a yearly conference led by the Division for Family and  Community Engagement . This workshop focuses on how to better connect with parents, including parents of ELLs. Ms.  Bonet also attends professional development seminars on using Kinvolved, our technology application which helps parents  text school staff in their native language.      Our teaching staff regularly attends professional development trainings and workshops. In the past, our ENL teachers, Ms.  Ortiz,  Mr. Carroll and Ms. Cojocarita have attended an ENL Professional Learning Community that met for two hours after  school monthly, on Wednesdays led by Duane Wardally, an achievement coach for the Urban Assembly Network. Also, ENL  teachers attend outside of network PDs throughout the school year.      Ms. Ortiz, Mr. Carroll, Ms. Casey and Ms. Cojocairta turnkey this information to content area teachers  throughout the school  year. Administration has scheduled designated time during our allotted Professional Development minutes to have a monthly  PD related to ELL topics (see question two for details). All teachers of ELLs (grades 6-12) are required to attend.              2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As per the CR Part 154.2, our school ensures that 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for ENL teachers  receive ELL specific professional development. Our school ensures that all teachers receive this during our mandated  professional development minutes. This occurs the 2nd Monday of each month throughout the academic school year. During  this time, Ms. Ortiz, Mr. Carroll, Ms. Casey and Ms. Cojocarita take turns to  present an ELL related topic. For the 2017-2018   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         school year, in September the topic will about ELL co-teaching. October will focus on an introduction to language acquisition  theories, November will focus on vocabulary acquisition and we will end the year in December with using technology for ELLs.  In the start of 2018, in January, we will focus on best practices for teaching ELLs at various levels, in February we will cover  building independence with ELLs and in March we will focus on a NYSESLAT overview. In April, we will present increasing ELL  voice in the classroom, in May the writing process and we will end the year in June with planning for our ELLs for the 2018- 2019 school year.  These monthly PDs account for the 15% of total PD hours along with any additional outside PD support  related to ELLs. Our ENL teachers receive 50% or more of their PD by participating in the ELL Professional Learning Community  and attending outside PDs throughout the school. Additionally, the ENL teachers attend all borough-wide training sessions  related to the administration and scoring of the NYISTELL AND NYSESLAT. Ms. Jufer keeps record of the PDs and workshops to  ensure our school is meeting the requirements. All staff must sign in on an attendance sheet and an agenda is provided to Ms.  Jufer and the administration staff.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      As of the 2017-2018 school year, parents will be provided with annual individual meetings to discuss the goals of the ENL  program and their students results on the NYSESLAT, Regents exams, state exams, etc. We scheduled these meetings during  our school-wide designated time for parent involvement, which takes place on Tuesdays from 8:00-8:45 am. If a parent is not  able to attend during this designated time then an alternate time is rescheduled. We begin with the 6  th   grade parents and  then advance through the grades. If language interpretation is needed, first we ask our school staff which includes speakers of  Spanish, Urdu, Arabic, Bengali and French. If we need other language translations then we call the NYC DOE Language  Interpretation Unit and use Language Line.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      ELL parents are encouraged to participate in all opportunities available for parent-school collaboration. One of the ways we  ensure ELL parent involvement is by offering parents an opportunity to join our PTA. Our PTA President, Cristina Bonet, uses  KinVolved (a translation language application) to text with parents to discuss the importance of joining and attending school  related events. All parents are able to discuss the events in their preferred language, which fosters parental involvement.  Additionally, during the school year, we host events to further foster parental involvement. One example is our annual  Thanksgiving Potluck. Parents and families of ELLs are invited to bring a cultural dish and have dinner with school staff and  other ELL families. Also, we host a field trip every spring and invite both our ELL students and their parents or guardians.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nathalie Jufer, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Urban Assembly School for Crim                                                                              School DBN: 20K609  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At UASCJ, we use home language data from the ATS (RHLA Report) and RCPL to determine the home languages  and home language preferences of our ELLs, former ELLs and students that are not identified as ELLs but speak  another language at home with their parents/guardians. When a new student enrolls from outside of the DOE,  the ENL Coordinator conducts a family interview, which requires filling out the Home Language Identification  Survey (HLIS). This information is then updated into ATS accordingly. In addition, we review our student  emergency contact cards to ensure the family language preferences align with our ATS reports. Based on the  results of the above data, we are able to determine our translation needs to ensure that all parents are provided  with appropriate and timely information in a language. This data provides us with information for our areas of  need in translation and interpretation. Prior to the start of the school, we have a Parental Orientation, which  includes all parents of ELLs. We use this meeting and Parent/Teacher Conferences to ensure that our language  data is accurate and that we have the most up-to-date information about our students, which includes who they  are living with and the correct home language of their parent/guardian.We also note if one of the parents or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      adults in the family are able to communicate in English for our records. We ensure that our language preferences  for the parent community are accurate through various sources of data.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

However, if they are not  available, we will request for  translation services through DOE  vendors. We also request translators  for our lower-incidence languages as  listed in our data. If we are not able to  secure a DOE vendor, we use  Language Line to conference with the  parent and family.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68     Meet the Teacher Night / Curriculum  Night   September 26, 2017   Parent Teacher Conferences   November 30, 2017   Parent Teacher Conferences   March 6, 2018   In-house translations will be provided  in Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, and Urdu.

Our administration and staff are aware of the goal. We establish the procedures for ensuring that Limited English  Speaking parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and  services critical to their child’s education. We ensure this happens by discussing necessary translation requirements at  cabinet meetings, SLT and PTA meetings and during our in house professional development time.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

The Parents' Bill of Rights and Guide to Language Access is  hanging in the main office by the desk of the Parent Coordinator, Cristina Bonet. We make sure each parent has a  copy of: Parents' bill of Rights, Achieve NYC Guide and a copy of Parents' Guide to Language Access. Additionally, at  parent engagement events, the ENL Coordinator, Michelle Ortiz speaks about rights as parents that are limited-English  Proficient. At these events, we have our in-house translators or DOE vendors for low-incidence languages.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       ENL Coordinator, Michelle Ortiz monitors a Google Drive to ensure all Language and Interpretation services are up-to- date. Additionally, a parent survey is provided in the home language (including low-incidence languages) to gather  feedback formally at the end of the year. Informally, parents are invited to discuss the quality of services at events  hosted by the PTA or SLT.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
