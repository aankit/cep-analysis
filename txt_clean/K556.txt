The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Bushwick Leaders' HIgh School Mission Statement: Bushwick Leaders' High School for Academic Excellence will  provide ninth through twelfth grade students with a quality secondary education, fostering active leaders with an  emphasis on academics, college preparation and career readiness. In collaboration with parents, teachers, and the  community, students will develop skills to become critical thinkers and problem solvers who will reach their highest  potential enabling them to compete in the 21st century. The school will take advantage of its small size to develop  strong interpersonal relationships based on trust and shared high expectations for students.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Bushwick Leaders’ High School for Academic Excellence is completing its fifteenth year of providing quality education,  having opened its doors for the first time in September of 2003. The school was founded as a collaborative effort  between the New York City Department of Education, East Brooklyn Congregations, and a community based  organizing effort consisting of 50+ member congregations in the East Brooklyn area, and local community educators.  Bushwick Leaders’ High School for Academic Excellence was founded to provide a quality education enabling students  to graduate and compete in the global economy as well as to encourage students to become active elements of  change within their communities. Bushwick Leaders’ High School for Academic Excellence utilizes the small learning  community to support the goal of developing strong interpersonal relationships between parents, teachers, students,  and the community.      The school primarily serves the Bushwick community where the majority of its students live. However, students from  surrounding communities such as East New York, Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Cypress Hills are  also serviced by the school. As per data provided by ATS 98% of our students are eligible for free lunch and 76% of our  students are of Latino background and 19% are black, with 89% having Spanish as the language at home and English  the language at school. 87% of our incoming 9 th graders are level 1 or 2 in Math and 87% of our incoming 9 th  graders are level 1 or 2 in ELA. For this reason we have provided our incoming 9 th graders with a double period of  Math, in preparation of the Common Core Algebra Regents in June. We provide our 10 th graders intensive  instruction in ELA, using the HMH curriculum, in preparation for the Common Core ELA regents exam, which we offer  to our 10 th graders. We also offer a group of 9th graders the opportunity to sit for the CC ELA Regents and all  students sit for the US History Regents, the Living Environment Regents and the CC Algebra Regents. Several students  acquire all four regents exams with 4 receiving college readiness in ELA and Math as well. This is partially attributed to  our use of AVID strategies and the AVID elective class as a support for students. This year will begin year 4th of AVID.      Our work has been around fostering student academic growth and development by challenging them and by having  high expectations. At BLHS we believe that students learn best when they are actively engaged in their learning.  Teachers present students with unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions or dilemmas, resulting in continued  growth within these skills. Additionally, in collaboration with East Brooklyn Congregations, parents, teachers, and the  community, our mission is for students to develop skills to become critical thinkers and problem solvers who will  reach their highest potential enabling them to compete in the global economy. We take advantage of its small size to  develop strong interpersonal relationships based on trust and shared high expectations for students.      BLHS capitalizes on its small size to foster strong interpersonal relationships between staff, parents, and students. Our  school’s hallmark is our four-year gender-based advisory program where the relationships between these three  groups are joined. Advisors are paired with their groups for four years. During this time advisors build a strong  foundation of trust and communication with their advisees. Moreover, advisors are the main liaison between the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11      school, parents/guardians and other staff and act as advocates throughout high school. Advisors, like classroom  teachers, utilize Skedula to create anecdotes (that can be shared with staff and/or parents and students) and to  capture up-to-date information on academic progress. Advisors utilize a recently revamped CCLS-aligned curriculum  in order to prepare students for the rigors of high school and higher education.       School administration has created meaningful interaction between different teacher teams that focus on specific  areas of teacher development that guide our teachers in their work with students in college and career readiness.  Teacher teams use student grade data and attendance data to formulate interventions with students who are at-risk  for academic failure. Teachers utilize the guidance referral process to refer students who are at-risk for non- promotion/no-graduation and/or social-emotional issues/concerns.       BLHS leverages close relationships with community partners to further enrich our school. The following grants will be  received for the 2018-2019 school year: Community Schools and Advantage. Both of these grants provide funding to  our CBO, Good Shepherd Services. We have collaborated with Good Shepherd Services and they have received an  Advantage grant that provides us with in school social work services, a youth advocate, an afterschool tutor, and  enables us to offer afterschool credit recovery and recreational activities . We will utilize our school budget to support  extended academic supports to our students.      Good Shepherd Services provides both in-school and an afterschool component of support to our students. They  provide social- emotional development and support by meeting with students on an individual basis or through  thematic groups. Additionally, GSS provides quality after-school programming such as Open Gym, Art, Music, Dance,  Boxing, and Academic Tutoring. GSS works with Expanded Learning Options for our students in various areas  (Lifeguarding, Music Therapy and UBS mentoring).       College and Career Readiness is a multi-faceted process at BLHS. Our College Counselor has worked closely with  administration and staff to create a ‘college going’ atmosphere supported by College Confident that is funded through  College Access for All. Students have access to an open computer lab with built in support from our College Counselor  and our College Confident counselor. The consultant also provides in classroom support in the 10 th and 11 th grades  and individual support in the 12 th grade. Moreover, both school counselors recruit for College Bridge programs such  as College Now, Building the Gap, Spring Focus, Life Link, Options Institute, Bottom Line and Ridgewood Bushwick.  Both School Counselors and five other staff members have received extensive training through Options Institute at  Goddard Riverside Center. During the College month, in October, we have an advisory college door competition as  well as college trips and speakers from various colleges come in to talk to students.       This year we will enter into our third year as a College Access for All School as well as an AP for All School. Both  programs have been instrumental in the 5% increase we have made in the College Readiness Index for this year’s 12th  grade, as well as the continued growth in acceptance of college applications as well as increased participation in  college level classes and AP classes. We will continue to grow our AP classes by offering an AP English Literature Class  and AP Computer Science class this year. Additionally, with our school entering it’s forth year as an AVID school, all  teachers entering the 2018-2019 school year, teaching core classes in grades 9 – 12 will be trained in AVID strategies.  To further support our school’s College and Career Readiness focus, we will continue to support students with IEP’s in  obtaining paid work experiences through the DOE TOP program. We will also encourage and support all students in   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12      working towards the CDOS credential. This year will also be the first year we plan on offering our students the Seal of  Biliteracy.       We hold three vital meetings once a week including Guidance, Attendance, and Pupil Personnel Team. In these  meetings we focus on both big picture issues such as overall attendance, patterns of student academic performance,  and establishing goals. We also focus on individual student issues such as homelessness, academic performance,  Language and Literacy, crisis intervention, drug prevention and intervention.         In addition to our work with students on college and career readiness and in addition to our work in building  partnerships with the community, we require all students to participate in two annual community service days per  year. They do this through advisory class and to date our advisory students have developed relationships with  agencies both in and out of Bushwick.      Collaboration and teacher teams are a major focus for us at BLHS. Each teacher at BLHS is a member of two teams  which engage in inquiry-based collaboration to improve the implementation of CCLS, support the instructional shifts,  and enhance college/career preparatory instruction. All advisory teachers also belong to a grade level advisory team.  Each team provides opportunities for distributive leadership since teachers take on several roles in the groups. To  ensure teams function effectively and teachers are successful in their roles, administrators monitor the progress of  teams through additional team structures, focused on analyzing current data (i.e., transcripts, Regents, MOSL data).          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   To support our ELL’s and Special Education students, we have worked to make Bushwick Leaders’ High School a full  inclusion school. All students with disabilities are placed in the least restrictive setting. At this time, our school has a  departmental Special Education Teacher to ensure Integrated Co-Teaching classes demonstrate differentiated  instruction and support for our various learners. Additionally the school has developed a CCLS Career Readiness Class,  which ensures students with disabilities not only prepare for their Regents but also the CDOS credential and gain  insight and skills for the professional world. To support our English Language learners we provide students with the  mandated number of periods of instruction as per CR-154 and their performance level. Additionally, we provide our  10 th grade ELL’s with an ESL teacher as a push-in to their Global Studies class. This is to provide our ELL’s, who have  not done well on the Global History Regents, additional literacy support using ELL strategies. We also provide all of  our students who have not passed the Living Environment Regents Exam with a Third term of Living Environment.  Additionally, students who have not passed the Global History Regents Exam take a World Trend elective class and  students who have not passed the American History Regents Exam take a Legal Studies Elective Class. We are also  excited to open our first Dual Langauge classes for ENL students this year. Students will receive instruction in a dual  language class in 9th grade math and in global history.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our work around The Framework for Great Schools has been extensive. In examining goals that are embedded in The  Framework for Great Schools, we have taken time as a staff to discuss where we are within the framework, and where  we need to improve so that our work is more closely aligned with the framework. In our conversations, we discovered  that we need to maintain our focus on Common Core aligned, rigorous instruction. This year we began year 4 of full   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13      implementation of HMH Common Core English Language Arts Collections Curriculum and CPM Math Curriculum for all  grades. Although we have worked very hard at developing our ELA curriculum, having a rigorous ELA curriculum that  is already aligned to the Common Core is a way we will provide our students with a curricula that is accessible to all  students and is rigorous. Although challenging at times, the curriculum has proved to be challenging for our students  but with the supports and rigor needed to help our students to make the strides necessary to do well on state exams.  We had a group of 9th graders take the ELA regents exam. Additionally, to support our teachers of math, we will  begin our first year as an Algebra for All school. Our 9th grade math teacher has attended training and we look  forward to seeing the impact of the implementation of the program in our June 2019 data.    In an effort to make college more accessible to our students, we are creating more college experiences for our  students both on site and at colleges. This year as a part of AP for All, we have 5 AP classes and 2 pre-AP class. As part  of Computer Access for All will have one AP Computer Science class. Teachers are receiving coaching and mentoring  from an offsite coach and from a peer collaborative teacher who is a member of our staff. We will also be offering a  college math class in collaboration with Medgar Evers for the this year.    Additionally, we will focus professional development on best practices in engaging students in learning. Our PD will  also focus on Danielson’s Framework for Teaching especially in domain 3. Professional Development is an essential  part of Effective School Leadership and it is a goal for our PD plan to build teacher capacity around student  engagement.    Out teachers will continue to collaborate and to look at student work and data in a way that fosters data driven  decision making and programming. We will work collaboratively to set goals based on student data and to use  ongoing assessment to achieve our goals, measuring where we are at each step towards our goals. The end result will  be to make gains enough to meet our AYP in ELA for the coming school year.               2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 32K556   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   281   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

We have a foundation that we can build upon in support of our work.   A priority that needs to be addressed is to create a common language and framework where all teachers may be  involved in the work. Last year we developed a RULER team that began the work of creating a sustainable way of guiding  our school community in addressing social emotional issues. Due to staffing changes, we will again train a new team in  Yale RULER and will fully implement the program into our advisory classes. Our suspension data and student removal  data indicates a need to address students in crisis in a consistent and supportive manner.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    The goals of the Expanded Learning Time program are as follows:         1. By June 2019, in order to increase credit accumulation for the lowest third in all grades through our Expanded  Learning Time program, there will be a 3 percent increase in credit accumulation, as evidenced in STARS, and the  School Quality Snapshot.    2. By June 2019, in order to increase pass rates on all students taking the Algebra Regents, through the support of our  Expanded Learning Time program, there will be a 5 percent increase in passing rates, as evidenced in STARS, L2RPT  data.        Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?   X   Voluntary      Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   In order to both motivate and mandate those students who are currently on our lowest third to participate in out ELT  program, we will conduct parent and student orientation, guidance meetings with individual students, and use our  advisory program and curriculum.         Part 3 – ELT Program Description    The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of  serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             37        Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   1. Summer School – Summer School credit recovery and regents preparation mandated for students who have failed  classes or regents exams, who are overage entering the 9 th grade for the first time, or who need to retake a regent’s  exam for a college readiness score of 85 for ELA and 85 for Integrated Algebra. Classes run from 8AM – 12PM from  Monday – Thursday during the months of July and August for a total of 48 hours per class. Students take between 1  and 2 classes per day for a total of 96 hours of extended school time hours.   2. After School Program Credit Recovery and Tutorials – Students who have failed a class or regents exam are  mandated to attend an after school or Saturday credit recovery program. Classes are offered in all of the core  subjects as well as Physical Education for a minimum of 54 hours per term per class. We offer these classes in the fall  and the spring terms. The program operates on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 3PM – 6PM and on  Saturday from 8AM – 12PM.The total hours per school year are 512 hours or program.   3. Good Shepherd's Afters s chool Program – This is an extra-curricular activities program based on student interest. It  begins with a student social hour, where students gather for a snack and socializing and then break out into interest  based activities such as dance, art, music, martial arts, boxing, yoga and open gym. The program goes hand in hand  with our After School Credit Recovery and Tutorials, allowing students to both attend After School classes and the  interest based GSS After school Program. The goal is to provide students with a place to go after school so they are  not on the street and where they can study, socialize and if necessary, receive counseling. This portion of our GSS  program is funded by the office of Community Schools and Advantage funds. The total hours of program are 384  hours    4. TASC Expanded Options Program – selected students will participate in internships after school and on weekends.  These internships will lead to paid summer employment and possible certification in a specified area such as  Lifeguarding.   5. CDOS Internships for career exploration for selected students, especially special needs students. Students will have  the opportunity to learn a skill in a work environment that may lead to a job,   6. As 85 percent of our incoming students in ELA are scoring at levels 1 and 2, and 84 percent of our incoming  students in Math are scoring at levels 1 and 2; these students require quality Expanded Learning Time services. We  believe that we are meeting the unique needs of these students through our ELT programs. Our services provide  targeted supports for the subgroups within the ELT program, that includes ELL’s and SWD’s. As each student in our  ELT group is closely monitored through our formative assessment systems, and reviewed by our fully scaled ELT team,  we are meeting the needs of each student through targeted instruction. Our students look forward to the daily and  individualized instructional supports they receive during ELT.        Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight   Part 4a.

This was a collaborative process as per the DOE and state mandates.   All assessments are expected to be aligned to the CCSS. Teachers meet in grade teams and departments to discuss  and determine assessments to be used, School leaders attend these meeting        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bushwick Leaders High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bushwick Leaders’ High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             49      ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   As a community school, we focused on designing a strong social-emotional support system for the students which  involved all members of the community school team as well as the existing counseling and support services team at  the school. By providing different counseling systems for students throughout the day (one-on-one and group  sessions, family counseling with the guidance counselors, boys/girl groups, etc.) students had the opportunity to work  on some of the social-emotional struggles they were facing which in some cases prevented them from focusing on  their academics and daily peer and adult interactions. As a result we saw improved social interactions in the  classrooms, student-led activities and groups during math and literacy lessons, student participation and Leadership  at school events as evidenced by informal classroom observations and attendance at school-wide events.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, The Community School Team will collaboratively with school leaders and stakeholders to increase  overall school attendance by leading the Attendance Team, provide case management and family outreach to  students and their families who are chronically absent, parent workshops, and a rewards system and incentives  program for students who maintain their attendance, as evidenced by weekly and monthly ATS and data sorter  attendance reports.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  The Community School structure will provide activities and coordination with the school’s academic and social- emotional program by providing leadership and activities to support the goals of the program. Included are tutorial  courses, individualized academic tutoring and social-emotional support. These supports will become part of the  regular school day that extends into after-school.For parents, literacy courses,parenting workshops, English language  learning and computer skills are just a sampling of the kinds of support that will be hopefully developed this school  year.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.

Strands will be  5  (10/15, 10/21, 10/28, 11/4, 11/12) sessions of 80 mins each session to use SIOP methodologies  and the book study.  Work will include best teaching practice share, lesson plan study, and  chapter reviews of the SIOP Model.    Currently our PCT, AP, ENL instructional team leaders, and Administrative leads are leading  vertical planning and benchmarking professional development sessions as well as weekly  sessions around best practices in ENL instruction.     Teachers will be held accountable for their PD work through observations and intervisitations  with the group.  They will also share their lessons, results and next steps as part of the  observation cycle and PD work.      We will also send our staff to professional development through NYCDOE offerings as well as  NYS Language RBERN at NYU and Fordham University.  Topics included will support LOTE  teachers,  CR-154 programming regulations for high schools, ENL teachers and content area  teachers.  PD will help us to become Bi-Literacy Certified.  The principal and key content and  ENL teaches will deliver their knowledge of QTEL by participating in 6 sessions of professional  development for principals.  Teaches and staff who participate in offsite PD will turnkey to other  staff members during department and grade team meetings.    Additionally, we worked with this year's new teachers the week before school started to give  them professional ddevelopment on the strategies and methods that we covered in last year's  professional development.  We will use our Monday afternoons to continue our SIOP  Professional Development in small group settings,to support teachers in the use of data to plan  for instruction, and to provide teachers with resources and tools in support of ENL  students..   For the teachers who teach Extended Day, we will offer intense SIOP PD, as well as  QTEL strategies, Integrated ENL strategies and other research based strategies to support ELL's  in their specific content areas.  We will look at both SIOP as well as various websites (Colorin  Colorado; National Writing Project, LDC) that support the work of teachers of English Language  Learners.  The focus of all PD sessions will be to provide teachers with strategies to enable ENL  students to become more effective and proficient writers and readers in content areas.     We collect agendas, handouts and attendance for each professional development presentation as  well as for teachers and staff who attend professional development offsite.   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

The purpose behind our parent  workshops are to make parents aware of school requirements, and forums pertaining to their  children's education.  Examples of such workshops include the NYS Language RBERN Parent  Academy and the AP for All workshop for parents of students who will take AP classes.  Materials promoting the events are sent home in the parent preferred languages and our Parent  Coordinator and advisor's follow up with phone calls using the appropriate translations to remind  parents of the events and the supports in place.  Agendas, handouts and  attendance documents are kept in binders with our school Parent Coordinator and with our  school CBO-Good Shepherd Services who support the workshops.  Additionally we offer individual sessions to families which is promoted through our school CBO  as identified by the student and family.  Individual services for families can include, Single Stop,  or counseling outreach which is translated in the parent preferred language.   Our rationale to the program is that: Parents of ENLs demonstrate the ability to better assist their  children in the learning process and a better understanding of the requirements for graduation as  evidenced by the implementation of strategies learned through their ENL classes such as how to  read a transcript and what is the best environment for doing homework or reading at home.  Parent participation at monthly PTA meetings will increase due to the support of both parents  and effective Extended Day and Saturday Programs.   By the same token, students' language  proficiency level will increase in the following ways:    1. Demonstrate improvement in writing, reading, and speaking skills    2. Demonstrate improvement in all comprehension of content skills    3.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1.  To assess early literacy skills, we regularly administer ESL Periodic Assessment Exams and MOSL exams to monitor student  progress throughout the year and teacher based assessments.   Teachers use data from periodic assessments and MOSL  administrations to inform their instruction.  Aside from English literacy skills, we use the Spanish LAB-R to evaluate all Spanish- speaking new admits that have already taken the NYSETEL and the score showed to be as low, so the Lab-R is used.  The LAB-R  is administered and based on the score, the new admit is determined to be eligible, the student is placed  appropriately. Additionally, this is used in conjunction with the MLS (Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener) to determine if the  students are SIFE.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65         THE ENL coordinator or ENL teacher interview with the parent coordinator (as the parent coordinator may be used as an  interpreter.)  They also conduct the home language survey at the interview.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We measure success by AYP in Math and ELA for ELLs, credit accumulation, passing of other state mandatory Regents Exams  and progress with NYSESLAT scores.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We conduct data analysis of each assessment and disseminate to teacher teams (both vertical and horizontal), the  programmer, counselors, paraprofessionals, and administration.  Teacher teams assess the different areas for example the  Math department would specifically assess trends identifying strengths and weaknesses and share their plans for intervention  with guidance and the programmer as well as families.  ELA would do the same.  All teams create action plans to support ELL  student needs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In review of  data reports such as we still need to increase the percentage of students who are making gains on the  ELA regents.  Additionally, the majority of our ENL students are graduating on time, with this year 4 graduating, especially with  the 4 plus one option and the addition of an advisory program and CDOS career ready class at BLHS.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  We use teacher teams to, such as grade team and department teams to drive data analysis.  Team disseminate, make  adjustments, annotate the data and connect their findings to lesson plans and team inquiries.  For example at our school,  teacher grade teams conduct lesson plan studies, where they use data to drive a grade team wise skill use, creating  benchmarks and assessments to check its effectiveness.  They prepare their findings to share with the whole school and  connect their work to showing the impact on specific groups.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered through free-standing and integrated in humanities subject models of ENL instruction as per  CR-154.  Students are scheduled as mandated by New York State for the appropriate number of classes per day.  In  free-standing ESL classes, students are grouped in heterogeneous groups by grade level and by  homogeneous groups  by proficiency level.  In integrated classes, students have an ENL teacher push into either a content area class or an  ELA class or both.  This grouping allows teachers to concentrate on needs that are specific to a grade level (e.g. 10th  grade Global Studies) and needs that are specific to a proficiency level (e.g. subject-verb agreement).    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66         c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We were awarded a dual language grant for our school and during the 2018-2019 school year, we will be executing a  dual language program in our 9th grade in the contents of Math and US History.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Currently our students receive services as follows:  Entering ENL:  220 minutes of a stand alone ENL class +220 minutes of for ELA+220 minutes of integrated service for a content  for a total of 660 minutes on instruction because we program students one period a day for the week in each of the above  categories.   Emerging ENL:  220 minutes of a stand alone ENL class +220 minutes of a integrated for ELA + 220 + a integrated service for a  content for a total of 660 minutes on instruction  Transitioning:  220 minutes of integrated service for ELA + 220 minutes of integrated service for a content class for a total of  440 minutes of instruction.  Expanding ENL:  220 minutes of integrated service for ELA + 220 minutes of integrated service for a content for a total of 440  minutes of instruction.  Commanding ENL:  90 minutes of integrated service for ELA or content class for a total of 90 minutes of instruction.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Content area instruction is delivered to ENL students in English with ESL supports.  Last year, a group of teachers were  trained in Sheltered Instruction Operational Protocol strategies via Administration.  This practice will continue. These  strategies were then turn-keyed to the entire staff at professional development throughout the year.  All teachers in the  school are expected to use lesson plans that incorporate a content objective, a language objective, and other ENL  methodologies.  Additionally, ESL teachers integrate into content-area classes with heavy concentrations of ELLs.   Using Title 3  monies the school has developed a dual language PM class that involves co-planning and instruction delivered for one period  in their native language and one period in English (Spanish/English)     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Spanish-speaking students who are newly enrolled are given the LAB-R in Spanish by a pedagogue who is fluent in  Spanish.  Students who can read and write in Spanish are offered Native Language Arts classes, taught by a certified Spanish  teacher.  Additionally they are enrolled in our AP Spanish Language and Culture.  We also offer a dual language class after  school, as an additional support for students.  During these classes students are assessed in class.  Students who do not have  Spanish as their native language are given the LOTE at the end of their first year at BLHS.  That data is then used as a guide for  further evaluation.                                          To determine if a student has had an interrupted  education, they are identified.                              5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5a) Upon ENL identification steps as per regulations, to meet their needs, we offer after-school tutoring and coursework in the  content-areas, 660 minutes of ESL instruction per week during their day program (entering students), and adapted  materials.  Content-area teachers also meet regularly with ESL teachers to discuss strategies and activities that will enable SIFE  students to be engaged in lessons and make progress, both in language and content.  Additionally, we offer a dual language  after school class to develop native language literacy skills.     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67      5b) Newcomers are offered ESL for 660 minutes per week, with one class period per day focusing on Language Arts.  Teachers  use adapted texts and ENL strategies, such as Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP, to ensure that students are  gaining language skills and language arts skills simultaneously.  Newcomers are also offered tutoring and given extra support in  their content classes.    5c)ELLs receiving service for 4-6 years are given different options, depending on how their language skills have  progressed.  Students who have moved up to the advanced level are given  660 minutes of support by an ESL tacher per  week.   They are also offered the same supports and tutoring as newcomers and SIFE students, as well as differentiated  instruction and small group instruction.  5d) Long-term ELLs are also given the number of minutes per week according to their proficiency levels.  Additionally, the  NYSESLAT modality report is used to determine strengths and challenges in the English language so that teachers can plan  accordingly to meet their language needs.    5e) Former ELLs are still eligible for testing accommodations (up to two years).  They are allowed to have an integrated  classroom ESL teacher at their parent's request, and are also encouraged to enroll into the Saturday Academy and PM School  Program.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    To better support ELLs and SWDs, there are a variety of materials available to aid in language development.  Teachers are  expected to use ENL strategies, such as SIOP components in their planning  and in their classrooms, including, but not limited  to visuals, PowerPoints, content/language objectives, supports in L1, multiple modalities, graphic organizers, and writing  prompts.  Additionally, there are adapted texts available, technology laptop carts in all classrooms and smart boards.  We will  continue to provide accommodations as per the IEP to support individual needs and instruction.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?      As with all of our Special Education students, Special Education ELLs are given options that allow them the least restrictive  environment.  They are offered flexible scheduling, which allows for access to all classes such as AVID and AP classes and can  be placed in general education classes in certain subject areas, as per their IEPs.  They are given additional accommodations as  per their IEPs, and if designated by the IEP, they are given paraprofessionals (bilingual).  We have 5  bilingual/alternate language paraprofessionals in the school.  Overall students are programmed according to their needs as  specified by their IEP.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  A variety of targeted intervention programs are used for ELLs in all content areas.    -AVENTA – literacy and credit recovery for SIFE and LTELLs  -After-school tutoring in Social Studies, Science, and Math (Spanish-speaking teachers present to assist content teachers)  -Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries available in all subject areas  - My brother's Keep (attendance initiative)  -Good Shepherd Services – After-school programs  -Advantage Grant (through GSS)  -Community Schools Grant   -Community Schools  -100 schools  -College Access for All/College Confident/Creative Connections Coach  -AP for ALL- AP Spanish Language and Culture  -Seal of bi-literacy process  -Seal of Service  -Planning a dual language program for the 2018-2019 school year in math.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Community Schools is geared towards parent involvement, after school activities and academic support for our ELLs.  In  accordance with the new CR-154 regulations, we are integrating ESL teachers into more content area classes than ever  before.  We also use Achieve 3000  as a literacy support for our school to support our ENL students and we have purchased  Collections, which as strategies and supports for ENL students.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.      This will be our 7th year working with Good Shepherd Services.  They work with students during lunch and after school,  offering activities that give students something to do in the after-school hours.  These activities include dance, sports, and  arts.  This program runs until 6pm on Monday-Friday and Saturday 8am-12pm.  This allows ELLs the opportunity to go to  tutoring or AVENTA and still be able to  participate in Good Shepherd activities.  Additionally, ELLs are encouraged to play on  school teams (e.g. basketball and volleyball) through our partnership with EBC Bushwick High School.  Aside from extra- curricular programs, ELLs are offered access to counseling and outreach in both English and Spanish.   Additionally the school is a community school member, AP for ALL, College Access for All, Algebra for All and Computer Science  for All (allowing us to be supported with our AP Spanish & Language curriculum), offering bilingual post secondary support and  instruction.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.    We are aware of the potential for technology to aid in language development and acquisition.  Teachers are offered  projectors so that they can use PowerPoint and other software to more easily incorporate visuals and other ELL-friendly  components into their teaching.  We have also added a SMARTBOARDs, elmos,  and desktops to every classroom with a state  of the art media center and library.  Classrooms have access to laptop carts to provide students with all possible technology to  make their learning more accessible and engaging. Additionally, we have a computer lab that is open after school for students  to work on projects and/or essays and college applications.  AVENTA is an online credit recovery program that is offered to ESL  students. We are alos bringing Achieve 3000 back to our school to support our ELL's and we have ipads and chromebooks, with  all students having a bushwickleaders.org email account, to aid students in content area classes.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In all content areas, there are measures taken to give native language support to ELLs.  Though not all teachers speak other  languages, bilingual glossaries are available in the subject areas, as well as bilingual dictionaries.  Moreover, teachers meet  with ESL teachers to find materials in the native language when possible.  Flexible grouping is also used in the classes so that  students can get clarification in L1 from other students in their groups.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are provided with additional support in a PM School or Saturday class.  During this period students are engaged in  learning activities based on their current grade and English proficiency levels.  The program incorporates AVENTA, literacy  skills, content based instructions, and reinforces daily instructional classwork.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    n/a     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Newly enrolled ELLs' coming to us from the 8  th   grade or over the counter this summer, were given access to our summer  ESL enrichment program.  Additionally, through the Good Shepherd services and other grant sources, students are given a  variety of academic and social activities.  For example, cooking classes, boxing, dance, basketball and so on.  Academic tutoring  is also offered as well as instructional classes.  The social activities such as group counseling, café jam, provides opportunities  for our newly enrolled ELLs to become familiar with our school, staff members, peers and it also gives them the opportunity to  become more acclimated with their new environment.    This year we also help showcases which highlighted student cultural  dances, food and celebrations with parents and all members of the school community.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Electives offered are: Spanish for native speakers and AP Spanish Language and culture.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    We will begin the planning phase for the 2018-2019 roll out of a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   All personnel at the school that services ESL students are provided with professional development from our Peer Collaborative  Leader (PCL).  Administration and the PCL visit classrooms and provide teachers with actionable feedback and best  instructional practices to work with their ELL population.  Administrators provided additional support with SIOP workshops for  new staff.  Teachers were provided with SIOP materials and additional supports at administrative feedback sessions to support  ELL's in their classrooms. Additionally teachers were provided with AVID training.  In an effort to assist teachers, administrators, and support staff in addressing the needs of ELLs, the following professional  development opportunities and the use of the common core, staff have agreed to use a common curriculum maps and aligned  units across the school which includes sections of "differnetiation" and "common core standards."      Staff will participate in strands which will target a particular area for a certain amount of weeks based on HEDI ratings, student  class needs, and educational trends.    We will continue:  •    implementation of SIOP program, building on what we did last year, as well as other researched based ENL strategies.    •     Encourage staff to register for graduate courses in differentiated instruction and ESL methodology and supporting  biliteracy certification needs  •     Continue to train teachers, administrators, and guidance counselors in technology and web-based programs for ELLs  •     Continue to provide teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, psychologists, and other staff with professional  literature to build awareness as to the needs of ELLs and best practices to address those needs.   •     Continue to train teachers and administrators in Common Core Standards and how they apply to ELLs  •     Plan to use the NYC writing project workshops  •     Build a list of web resources for teachers of ELLs, guidance staff, and administrators   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70                 2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Students and parents are invited to student orientations that are offered in English and native languages.  At these  meetings,  families meet with teachers and administrators to discuss the school year, calendar, expectations and  coursework.  Additionally the school holds countless parent-teacher meetings with grade teams and offers open houses and  parent literacy workshops to assist with the transition to high school and college.  On such workshop is around credits and  regents (graduation requirements for families new the school and system).  This school year,  staff will be trained in Restorative Justice  and 100 schools initiative so that they can work with their  advisories to establish norms as to what is expected socially and academically in high school.  Advisory is a major support of  transition for our students and ELLs.     Throughout the year, the entire staff is trained in ELL strategies, as it is one of the central focuses of our school and our  professional development programs.  This is done in department meetings, grade-team meetings, after school, and on DOE- designated professional development days.      Additionally, ELL teachers are sent out to professional development through the  Office of English Language Learners, and a workshop series on cross curriculum wiring was held here by their office.  They do  intervisitation with schools with large populations of ELLs.  Records are kept with sign in sheets and agendas which are housed in binders in our main office.               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school has 4 marking periods per semester as an initiative to inform parents pf their child's progress throughout the  semester as per their child's program.  ESL teachers schedule parent meetings and send out progress reports as needed.  Our  parent coordinator assists with the outreach as well.  We also hold one extra parent-teacher/curriculum night per semester  with translation services .  The school invites bilingual staff members to translate to Spanish speaking parents during these  conferences.  All materials are translated in the home language survey and we use translation services if for a language need  other than Spanish.     Records of meetings are kept on sign in/attendance sheets and with counselor logs of meeting minutes if guidance and/or  parent coordinator attends        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our school has an active parent coordinator who assists the executive members of the PTA to hold monthly PTA meetings.  ELL  parent participation is high in these meetings and they are conducted in English and in Spanish. The PTA meeting have great  participation of teachers as well.  Additionally,   we hold meet and greet nights by grade level and offer ESL classes for  parents.  We also hold one extra parent-teacher night per semester with translation services available for teachers to speak  with parents of ELLs.  The school invites bilingual staff members to translate to Spanish speaking parents during these  confrences.       This school year, through grant work,  we offered bilingual college counselor workshops to parents about graduation  requirements, the college application process and financial aid.  We held multiple parent workshops throughout the year  about housing, literacy, and other topics as surveyed by parents.  Our cultural celebrations were highly attended, specifically  by parents of students with ESL and all events we have translations.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Catherine Reilly, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bushwick Leaders' High School                                                                              School DBN: 32k556  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our school uses the home language survey and emergency blue cards to assess our school's written translation  and oral interpretation needs. Parents of new students and entering 9th grade students are interviewed in their  native language or through translation if the native language is other than Spanish. All of our incoming students  this year have indicated English, Spanish, Arabic and Haitian Cerole as their preferred language. This has been  entered on the BIOS screen at admission and communication is done in the preferred language. The school  population as a whole consists of 553.23 Spanish, 45.22% English, and 1.55% other consisting of Arabic and Hatian  Creole. Some parents have indicated they speak English, correspondence with these parents is delivered in both  languages (English and their native).           2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             75     2.
