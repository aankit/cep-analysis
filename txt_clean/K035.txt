This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our coherent set of beliefs on how students learn best and school mission statement is embodied within our  C.H.A.N.G.E. acronym. Challenging and Meeting Our Students Needs On a Daily Basis, Having and Believing and Clear  and High Expectations, Analyzing and Strategizing the Data to Inform Instruction, accepting No Excuses, Gaining  Knowledge to Increase Student Outcomes and Our Own Professional Growth and Empowering Parents and Families to  Work Collaboratively in Ensuring College and Career Readiness. During the 2018-2019 school year we will take a  "Deeper Dive into the Year of Change"   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Stephen Decatur School is a middle school with 228 students from grades 6 through 8. The school population  comprises of 89% Black and 10% Hispanic students. The student body includes 2% English language learners and 29%  special education students. Boys account for 54% of the students enrolled and girls account for 46%. The average  attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 school year was 92%.      We proudly utilize a new state of the art Science Lab and launched our partnership with Urban Advantage Science for  Middle Schools, which provided our students and families to experience science exploration. It is our goal to enhance  our instructional delivery through the Arts and Sciences that will permeate through all content areas.    In our effort to “Create a Community of Lifelong Learners,” The Family Dynamics Program Beacon Center, which is a  member of the SCO family of services is housed in the building and provides after school activities for our students as  well as services to address the “whole child”. A plethora of services are provided for all families included but not  limited to financial planning, individual and family counseling as well as a student-centered programs during school  holidays such as winter and spring recess and summer camp.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with Disabilities and Overage Students      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements that our school made the most progress on over the past year as it pertains to the Framework for Great  Schools are Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties and Trust. Our key areas of focus for the 2018- 2019 school year will be Rigorous Instruction through student engagement. In addition, we would like to increase the  proficiency levels of our students with special with disabilities, specifically the students within our self-contained  population who continue to struggle with reading stamina and fluency with ultimately prohibits their growth in  reading comprehension. We have aligned our school mission to the Framework for Great Schools to further frame our  work as a school community with a specific lens on Students with Disabilities. However, our key area of focus in the  Framework for Great Schools for Rigorous Instruction for 2018-19 in English Language Arts will be to increase the text  complexity of the novels that students are reading while improving their academic vocabulary. We will continue the  Word Generation program and the partnership with MSQI (Middle School Quality Initiative) to achieve this goal. In  addition, we will embark upon the new citywide writing curriculum entitled Empowering Young Writers which will  provide our students with an exposure to multicultural genres authors. In Mathematics our focus is to provide more  opportunities for students to write in mathematics on a daily basis in order to improve their thinking and writing skills  in the content area of mathematics. English Language Arts summative data has revealed that students are proficient  writers but are struggling with reading comprehension and vocabulary development and in mathematics students are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      challenged with conceptual thinking and writing in mathematics. As a result, we will institute the W.I.N. (What I Need)  periods in order to focus on each student's strengths and weaknesses.    The WIN periods will take place for 135 minutes three days of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday).  Students will be grouped based on their academic needs in groups of 15-18 students per group. WIN offerings will  range but will not be limited to Wilson Language, Just Words, Math Literacy, Debate, Mock Trial and Regents Prep.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 16K035   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   245   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our school's strength as it relates to rigorous instruction is to ensure that students are receiving standards based  instruction on a daily basis through classroom lessons that are student driven and require students to think critically  with the support of engaging activities that are measurable and obtainable within the classroom setting. In order to  address the cultural needs of our students we have implemented the Educating Powerful Writers curriculum that  follows the writing process models with opportunities for student choice, exposure to and engagement with diverse  texts. Mentor text sets to showcase the talents of writers with diverse identities and perspectives for our students to  identify with for each unit of study will provide a sense of ownership and self-awareness that will lead to increase  student achievement across all content areas.   Cultural awareness of implicit cultural bias in the classroom will be addressed on a monthly basis during faculty  conferences to make educators aware of their biases and how we can ensure that all students similarities and  differences are respected in a cultural responsive classroom. Providing educators the opportunity to examine and  express their own belief systems will enable them to make modifications when necessary to ensure that all students  feel included and valued in their learning environment.   We have continued our partnership with MSQi to provide additional teacher support, instructional resources for  educators and school administration with a priority on vocabulary development and writings skills. Teachers align  their curricula and implement academic supports to yield meaningful student work products, yet there are missed  opportunities so that some learners, including English language learners and special education students do not always  have the strategic supports they need to demonstrate higher-order thinking skills in their work products consistently.  In addition, teacher feedback must also be specific to guide educators in the appropriate path that will adhere to an  increase in student achievement.     Our school community currently aligns our school curriculum to the Common Core Learning Standards and/or  content standards through teacher created curriculum maps that encompass aligned units of study which focus on  the instructional shifts in both ELA and Mathematics. The English Language Arts department utilizes the Scholastic  Code X, Expeditionary Learning curriculum as well as additional resources such as Triumph Learning Crosswalk  Curriculum for Triple A, New York Ready, News ELA website, and other research-based resources as applicable.       During the 2018-19 school year our school community will partner with MSQI (Middle School Quality Initiative) to  enhance our literacy vision. The 2018 ELA summative data revealed a 20% gap between students ability to understand  complexed text and their writing process which resulted in a 1% decrease in our proficiency level from 2017 which  was 24% to 27% in 2018. As a result, students will embark upon the Word Generation program for academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      vocabulary through literary text. Words will be utilized across all content areas five days a week. Reading  comprehension will be monitored through the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) assessments (3 times a year) and  other interventions when necessary such as Just Words and Wilson to provide a richer literacy community. In  addition, selected students will receive group instruction on reading comprehension through the MSQI Strategic  Reading Toolkit and the STARI (Strategic Adolescent Reading Intervention) program for students reading below grade  level.      Our Mathematics department utilizes the CMP3 curriculum and the EngageNY modules as well as the mathematics  practices to execute their lessons. The 2018 summative data revealed a 3% increase in student proficiency from 11%  in 2017 to 14% in 2018. Data revealed in Grade 8 that students ability to write mathematically in both short and long  response questions indicates student lack of academic vocabulary in mathematics. During the 2018-19 school year  students will engage on each grade level in math literacy clinics that will focus on academic vocabulary and writing in  mathematics focused on the following format: Tuesday-Topic/Standard and Vocabulary Tip Chart/Problem Strategy,  Wednesday-Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative Task and Thursday-NYS Assessment Task. We will continue our  partnership with Assessment Matters to analyze and craft instructional strategies and assessments to monitor our  students progress in writing in mathematics that encompasses academic vocabulary and conceptual thinking through  formative and summative assessments as well as through our checks for understanding protocols established in June  2018.    All students in Grades 6-8 including Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners through the utilization of  the Scholastic Code X Curriculum and Teacher designed Common Core Curriculum engage in the full implementation  of the Common Core Learning Standards which focus on students reading and responding to a combination of literary  and informational texts. Students will engage in writing tasks that focus on argumentative writing and high order  critical thinking through classroom discussions, research and project based learning tasks.    Science educators will continue to infuse the literacy standards within their curriculum through independent readers  and articles of the week in all grades. In the social studies classrooms, students and educators will focus on the  following traits: Argument, Command of Evidence, Introduction and Conclusion as well as the English Language  Conventions. Modifications to performance tasks are created accordingly to meet the needs of all students. Educators  create tiered questions as well as expose students to differentiated Articles of the Week. The Articles of the Week are  utilized across all content areas except mathematics in grades 7 and 8 as a tool for exposing our students to non- fiction texts. Math educators will create word problems utilizing the words of the week. Students are required to  annotate, create questions and inferences as well as be prepared to discuss the article as it relates to specific  questions posed by the teacher. A variety of Language acquisition strategies will be shared with educators during  school-wide professional development sessions and followed up during common planning periods in both English  Language Arts and Mathematics.   All students in Grades 6-8 including Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners through the utilization of  the CMP3 (Pearson-Connected Math Program) , EngageNY and Jump Math modules will receive instruction aligned to  the Common Core Learning Standards that require fluency, application and also deepens their conceptual  understanding of mathematical concepts. Students will engage in the Math Practices that provide them the  opportunity to engage in hands-on tasks as well as conversations with their fellow classmates of specific skills,  theories and computations.   Lead Teachers in collaboration with the UFT Teacher Center will continue to identify the instructional strategies that  will guide our professional development sessions in order to develop a coherent set of beliefs that will frame our  instructional practices. Classroom visitations, timely feedback and professional development sessions will create the  atmosphere for improving student achievement.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on our last School Quality Review, parents expressed that the school staff is exceedingly caring and nurturing  and maintains ongoing communication with families through phone calls, one-to-one conversations, school  newsletters, and weekly progress reports via Jupiter Grades’, a computer based program that also provides strategies  for use at home. Parents described the school as “hands-on” and stated “everybody takes a part in it.”    As a school community we have created multiple opportunities and modalities to interface with parents on a daily  basis. Our repertoire includes but is not limited to verbal and written communication, individual conversations and  conferencing. For example, parents are aware of our daily activities via Jupitergrades (a web-based communication  system). In addition, our goals and expectations are formally written in our Parents/Family Handbook introduced  during our Back to School Festival and reiterated at all community meetings.    Finally, in order to support parents and families in understanding their child’s progress towards these expectations  there are key personnel that parents and families have access to who provide academic, social and emotional support  as needed.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Stephen Decatur Middle School Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. M.S. 035 Stephen Decatur, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Stephen Decatur Middle School 35 will support parents and families of Title I students by: Providing Workshops that  include but not limited to the following:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology; i.e.    ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.        Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Stephen Decatur Middle School                                                                              School DBN: 16K035  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
