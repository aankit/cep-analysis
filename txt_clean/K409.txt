This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   East New York Family Academy(E.N.Y.F.A) Mission Statement    “We are a kind and caring family of curious and thoughtful learners.”   ● We recognize the ability of all children to learn well.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      ● We instruct, support and prepare students for higher learning and successful workforce participation.   ● We strive to maintain rigorous academic standards and current technological integration.   ● We facilitate our students’ exploration of their individual intelligences, emotional and social skills, and we guide  their access to their full potential.   ● We are committed to communication among our students,parents, staff and other stakeholders that reflects  kindness and caring.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    East New York Family Academy(E.N.Y.F.A) is a middle/high school with 491 students from grade 6 through grade 12.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Based on the Framework For Great Schools Report 2018 our scores for the element of Rigorous Instruction are higher  than the city average. This data confirms an improvement in the school’s overall ADVANCE observation ratings for  component 3C: Engaging Students in Learning than that of previous years. In addition, the Teacher Leadership  Program training, monthly lead teacher workshops at the Superintendence and teacher training from the Brooklyn  North Field Support Center has helped move our practice from teacher led to student centered. As evident from  observations conducted by outside and school based observers.   As a result    a. teachers collaborate more and share best practices, use common core aligned rubrics and literacy strategies and  making interdisciplinary connections   b. lesson plans challenge and engage student thinking   c. performance tasks are aligned to common core standards   d. students are engaged in higher order thinking tasks    e. students are engaged in more thoughtful questioning and discussions    f. students are scoring higher on assessments   g. more student centered activities and discussions.   Despite our higher than city average score for rigorous instruction 85% (an increase of two percentage points from  last year), we recognize the need for improvement. It is our belief that all of our students can and will learn, if we  provide them with engaging and rigorous activities . Hence we have an obligation to move the remaining 17% of our  students forward.    To move these students forward we will carefully review our end of year assessments: scholarship report, Regents  and other city-wide measures of assessments, as well as surveys. We have specifically targeted our bottom third,  ELL’s, and Special Needs populations, and we have formed action committees to better address the needs of these  students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

By June 2019, 85% of our students will become more proficient in the use of citing evidence to support their claims as  measured by a common rubric. Students will take beginning of year, mid year and end of the year assessments. In  addition, during department meetings staff will analyze data during their instructional rounds work to gauge student  progress.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

The 2017-2018 Quality Review    Indicator 3.4 we were rated proficient and an area of celebration . The attendance rate is 90.9 % and is at par with last  year’s rating. The number of suspensions has decreased by approximately 15% but the number of referrals for  Guidance Counseling intervention increased by 15%. In addition, we survey students through the student government  and the results were always positive and encouraging.   In regards to the element of Supportive Environment the students at East New York Family Academy have a safe and  caring environment that is open 6-7 days a week. In addition, students stay afterschool up to 8pm to talk with peers  and Staff, relax, attend after school activities, receive homework help, and use the computer lab for assignments.  Staff members volunteer their time during their lunch periods, after school and on Saturdays to tutor and/or engage  students in extra-curricular activities i.e. Chess club, sports and arts activities. Therein lies the strength of our school  as evident by the number of students/parents and Staff (including school safety and custodians) actively involved and  committed to the East New York Family culture. There is a saying in our school that we have to plead for students to  leave the school compound or they will never leave.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on the 2017 Framework for Great Schools report in the element of Effective School leadership we scored higher  than the city’s average in each of the 4 indicators. Three of those indicators are marked strong areas. The Trust  element of the Framework also indicates a high level of Effective School Leadership between the trust of Staff,  Parents and Students towards school administrators. Moreover, on the 2018 Quality Review the rated indicator 3.4(  High Expectations) as Well Develop and stated: "Administrators consistently communicate high expectations for  learning to all families and school staff and implement support systems to help them work with students to meet the  expectations. School leaders consistently hold all staff accountable for meeting high expectations for teaching and  learning across the school."   The strengths are evident:   In the above stated qualitative and quantitative data.   Next Steps:   1) Continue to build high expectations regarding teacher performance and student outcomes.   2) Communicate with all stakeholders (Staff, Students, C.B.O’s and Parents) how to measure student growth based on  the Growth Model concept and it’s correlation to where students are in regards to Mastery of the Common Core  Learning Standards   3) College and Career Readiness Section Rating on the 2013-2014 School Quality Guide is at the Approaching the  Target Range (42.6).    Hence it is our endeavor to have all stakeholders shift their thinking behind the meaning of a student’s grade or score.  In Best grading practice there should be a direct correlation between a student scores /grades and where they are on  the continuum of mastery of the standards. We call it the Growth Model Grading Policy . This will prepare all  stakeholders for the year 2022 when there will be a shift in Regents minimum passing score. A student scoring below  a 75% in ELA or below an 80% on the Algebra Regents exams, failed that exam because they did not meet mastery of  the tested standards.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Our school has a teacher led team that recruits, interviews; rates demo lessons and select candidates for possible  teaching assignments. After this vetting process the teacher team rates the performance of each candidate then make  a recommendation to the Principal’s cabinet for final decision. In regards to retention of qualified teaching staff,  teachers are an integral part of the Administrative team to monitor, revise and conduct professional development  plans, as well as engage in peer observations/ inter-visitation and provide actionable feedback during grade and  department meetings.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All members of our professional learning community are engaged in book /article studies that showcase best practice  that improves student outcomes. Moreover, they reflect on their practice and are provided a safe, trusting  environment in which they share successes and areas in need of improvement. Teachers who show best practice  share their pedagogical and content strategies with the Staff during our whole school, grade and department  meetings. Selected teachers are members of the Teacher Leadership Team program and who engage teachers in  improving practice , assist in monitoring and revising professional development plans and inter-visitation protocols  and tools. Lastly, our learning community is engaged in analyzing student work, performance tasks and unit plans that  are aligned to the Common Core State Standards and College and Career Readiness Standards .

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Using the school’s theory of action and school’s philosophy the teachers choose assessments that engage students to  increase literacy across the disciplines by having students cite evidence and provide a rational for their answers in  written, oral and project based forms. Pedagogical Staff analyze student work, discuss students’ strengths and  weaknesses and then design next steps to increase student outcomes. This inquiry process drives the professional  development plans for the whole, grade and department professional learning meetings.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. East New York Family Academy, in compliance with the The Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       East New York Family Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students are assessed in content areas with diagnostic tests that include Pearson School.net, the SCANTRON Performance  Series in all grades, and MobyMax and GO Math! assessments in the middle grades.   Our school uses teacher-written  assessments in the assessment of the four language skills, literacy and content knowledge. In addition, ELL students new to the  school are given a teacher-generated Spanish reading test and the Bader Reading and Language Inventory which is a one-on- one assessment of English word decoding and reading comprehension.   These assessments provide information about native  literary skills, word-recognition, and comprehension of English. The results of diagnostic tests are use to give teachers specific  data on the strength and weaknesses of ELL students to determine programming for students and to guide instruction by  indicating the learning gaps.  The base-line data for teacher-generated assessments have shown the majority of our ELL  students to have low literacy skills in English.  A majority of our students whose home language is Spanish have low literacy   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         skills in Spanish.  The formative assessments have shown that many of our ELL students entering ninth grade have significant  gaps in their knowledge of content-area vocabulary and concepts, especially science and math.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers meet weekly in grade-level and subject department teams and devote time to analyzing results from formative  assessments as well as completed classroom assignments and writing samples to understand students’ levels of skills and  knowledge in specific subjects and language needs.  School-wide ICT teams for the middle and high school also meet weekly  and review data from formative assessments specifically for ELL students with learning disabilities.  They discuss findings with  other teachers in grade and subject meetings.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Students are given Pearson School.net benchmark assessments in ELA, math, science and English as a Second Language.  The  progress of ELL students is also evaluated using data from their attendance, passing rates, rates of grade-level promotion and  credit accumulation, class grades, and performance on unit and comprehensive exams in class.   We have identified some  specific areas of need.  These needs include the academic vocabulary and concepts of math and science in 9th and 10th grades  and literacy skills, including reading comprehension and written expression in 6th and 7th grades.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers also use Google documents and other platforms to organize and analyze student data.  At the conclusion of  instructional units teachers use the Writing Matters rubric to grade final versions of student work.  Scores are entered into  assessment tracker and teachers in team meetings to assess student writing to identify areas of students’ strengths and  weaknesses.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school provides a menu of services for ELL students who fall below standards on the annual English Language proficiency  assessment.  Teachers in ICT, grade, and department team use data to identify specific areas in need of  improvement.  Students have access to school-wide after-school and Saturday tutoring, lunchtime tutoring and other supports  that afford them intensive instruction in content areas.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The results of the NYSELAT and Regents Exams are accessed by teachers by using the Skedula website and ATS  reports.  Teachers make use of spreadsheets and the AMAO Estimator Tool to analyzed trends and improve our ENL  services.  In the current year the results of state tests together with promotion rates resulted in a shift from the content  classes that the ENL instructor was working in.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The results of state assessments are presented and discussed in faculty meetings as well as the grade and department team  meetings.  Our administrators develop power-point slides showing growth and progress at meeting high school graduation  requirements and college and career readiness standards.  Our ENL instructor compiles a summary of the assessment results  for ELL students for review with administrators in order to create instructional programs for students and teachers so that  areas of need can be addressed with greater support.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELL students in our school receive English language services through integrated instruction in their English Language  Arts and Social Studies classes with a licensed ENL teacher working cooperatively with content teachers.  The ENL  teacher works individually with ELL students and also provides mini-lessons that have language and content  objectives.  Free-standing classes also meet during the school day with un-graded and heterogeneously mixed  groups.  These classes address the objectives of all of the students' content classes as well as language development.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Classes in our school meet for forty-five minute periods.  ELL students at the entering level of proficiency are given stand-alone  classes and integrated instruction for 15 periods.  Students at the emerging and transitioning levels are given 10 periods of  either type of instruction and students at the expanding level are given 5 period of only integrated instruction.  Proficient  students are programmed so that they have access to the ENL teacher during two of their content classes.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   High School ELL students are programmed for content classes with integrated instruction provided by content and ENL  teachers.  The ENL provides instruction both individually and with small-group mini-lessons.  Instruction is provided in  English.  Student are provided with supplementary materials and parallel texts in their native language.  Stand-alone classes  also meet which are conducted in consultation with the students' content teachers.  The classes are structured to address the  New York State Learning Standards.  ELL who struggle in meeting the learning standards for their grade level are offered  lunchtime tutoring, an after-school program with homework assistance and Saturday tutoring sessions in the content areas.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Entering and emerging-level ELL students complete some of their content assignments in their native language and this work is  evaluated for accuracy and fluency of expression.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our school is prepared to meet the needs of SIFE and newcomer students with differentiated instruction and materials.  At this  time our ELL population consists of developing, long-term and former ELL students.  The instruction provided for developing  learners includes supplementary native language resources, basic resources for English, including picture dictionaries and low  intermediate-level reading texts and strategies for building vocabulary.  Long term ELL and former ELL students are provided  with high-interest supplemental reading materials in the content areas and receive individual feedback on writing mechanics   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      and fluency.      Since many of our developing and long term ELL students still struggle with reading and writing we maintain an ongoing focus  on non-fiction reading, and using textual evidence to support ideas in writing. We utilize supporting materials, printed and  online, to reinforce concepts and vocabulary in the Social Studies curricula.  We have incorporated e-books which afford  students a wide selection of titles with which to continue progress at their own pace and build listening comprehension skills  along with reading skills. Access to these e-books is available via laptops in classroom computer carts.  Teachers continue to  provide context-rich direct writing instruction, that involves cooperative group to strengthen accuracy and fluency in the  written expression.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students with learning disabilities who are entitled to bilingual / ENL services are programmed for small classes with an  Integrated Collaborative Team Teaching model.  Teachers provide scaffolding techniques, small group instruction, templates  for writing and discussion, classroom library and tutoring outside of class.  During the current year teachers have striven to  incorporate new modalities for learning and information sharing, including the use of computer technology.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Students in the ELL population who have IEPs are scheduled together at the same grade level for Integrated Collaborate Team  Teaching and Integrated ENL.  This provides them with a learning community that includes general education students and  native English speakers.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ENL instructor monitors student progress and collaboratively with guidance counselors recommends academic  interventions, as needed. Academic interventions available for all ELLs include participation in after-school and Saturday  tutoring, and Regents prep sessions. The ENL TEACHER also collaborates with the testing coordinator to ensure that ELL  student taking Regents examinations are given their allowed accommodations. Our school keeps several carts equipped with  word-for-word dictionaries to lend to students while they are taking Regents Examinations. General performance of ELLs  reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT continues to be monitored by the ENL teacher. A data base is updated on a yearly basis.    Commanding-level ELL students are offered extra tutoring.  Following conferences with these students, guidance referrals (for  program modifications or particular situations to be dealt with) or academic intervention services (additional tutoring,  homework assistance, Regents prep) are recommended.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     We anticipate adding a new study area for ELLs with bilingual resources, picture dictionaries and a reading library.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL have equal access to all school programs and supplemental services which include a CBO-run after-school program, before- school swimming instruction, after-school Performing Arts and Step programs, men's and women's retreats, Saturday tutoring  and Regents prep sessions.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teachers of ELLs students make use of smart boards, classroom textbooks, classroom libraries, computers, computer rooms,  reference books, supplementary bilingual materials and mobile labtops.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ELL students have access to bilingual dictionaries, online translators, supplementary bilingual materials in content areas and  video and online material in their native language.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Services and resources are evaluated for age- and grade-level appropriateness by department curriculum teams in  consultation with an ENL specialist or ENL teacher.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Teachers of ELLs students make use of smart boards, classroom textbooks, classroom libraries, computers, computer rooms,  reference books, supplementary bilingual materials and mobile labtops.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our school hosts an orientation session for all newly enrolled ELL students that includes presentations by upper-class students  and teachers.  Throughout the year ENL teacher keeps track of the progress newly enrolled ENL students are making and  collaborates with the guidance counselors, with input from grade and department teams to recommend academic  interventions, if needed.  Academic interventions available for newcomers include lunchtime tutoring, after-school homework  help, and the Saturday tutoring. Parents are continuously informed through phone calls, mail, and Pupil path of the academic  progress of their children.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer any language electives at this time.  We are hoping to add another Spanish or French teacher for the 2017- 2018 school year to enable us to offer language electives.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL teacher and other teachers of ELLs participate in a range of professional development sessions both planned in the  school and at other sites.  The topics of current and future workshops have included brain research, second-language  acquisition, themes in applied linguistics, questioning techniques, cultural contrasts and integration, classroom resources,  writing process, cooperative learning, critical thinking, attention, memory, the psychology of learning, social and emotion   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         learning, use of the internet   Professional development sessions focused on the New York State Learning Standards have included such topics as close  reading, writing complex sentences, templates for persuasive essays, other writing scaffolds such as RACE, and interdisciplinary  unit-writing.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Both ELL and mainstream students participate in a Bump It Up day in which high school teachers introduce themselves to  graduating middle schoolers and provide them with an experience of ninth-grade subjects and assignments.     Professional development workshops for teachers in our school includes sessions explaining how ELLs services work.  Teachers  also have opportunities to discuss issues related to their experience teaching ELLs as well as gain explosure to concepts and  theory in the field of language acquisition.  The sessions also include a demonstration of good practices for co-teaching and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  The professional development activities are  planned by the principal in consultation with teachers and the principal keeps a record of session agendas and attendance.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL coordinator plans annual individual meetings with the parents of ELL student in collaboration with students' guidance  counselors.  Bilingual teachers, paraprofessionals, a family school aid, and other staff are available for interpretation and  translation.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The parents of ELL student participate in Parent Association meetings, parent-teacher conferences and other Open School  Night events, award presentations, evening assemblies and variety of family-oriented events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anthony Yard, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parents are interviewed during intake and orientation for new student admission in order to determine their  preferred language of communication. The ESL coordinator uses responses on the Home Language Survey and  ATS reports to identify students born outside of the U.S. Announcements are made in Spanish to all parents  attending school events about the the availability of interpretation and translation services. Parents who need  interpretation are encouraged to sit in an area an interpretor is available. Based on ATS data, sign-in sheets and  interviews with school staff continually update parents' language preferences as indicated on the Emergency Blue  Cards which are stored in the main office of the school. The Language Access Coordinator keeps current ATS  reports (Adult Preferred Language Report) on file for reference.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60     2.

We hope to  develop a text messaging capacity that would reach parent contact numbers in the coming year.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Our Language Access Coordinator and ENL teacher plan to conduct sessions during scheduled faculty meetings that  apprise teachers and other school staff of the translation and interpretation services, the rights of access on the part  of parents, and also to determine how current supports for ELL parents can be improved.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school displays a Welcome Poster, the Parents' Bill of Rights, the Parents' Guide to Language Access and the  Language Identification Guide in the lobby of the school and its main office. Copies of the documents are provided to  parents upon request.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent feedback about the quality and availability of language translation services is solicited in the DOE parent survey  and from the responses of parents attending school events and meetings as well as during over-the-phone  conversations.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
