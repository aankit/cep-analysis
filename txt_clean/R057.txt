This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our school’s mission is that we work together as a school family to ensure that all children will reach their full  potential. We will maintain high expectations and promote academic excellence for all students. We will create and  support a school environment in which all children and adults feel welcomed, respected, trusted, and an important  part of the school. We will create an environment where we can learn together and support each other.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 57 is a Title I school located in the Park Hill section of Staten Island. Eibs Pond Park sits within one block of P.S 57  and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation designated this pond area as protected wetlands.  We have a diverse population that consists of 55% black students, 35% Hispanic students, 4% white students, and 4%  Asian students. The school’s attendance rate is currently 90%. PS 57 is a universal feeding school. We are currently a  school in good standing. We currently serve grades Pre K-5 with 635 students. Our entire school receives free lunch.  Our male to female ratio is 50% of each.   Our school is collaborating with Manhattanville College and the Reading Reform Foundation for an intensive early  childhood reading program to identify reading disabilities like dyslexia in students. We currently have 4 teachers  trained and are sending 4 more teachers this summer. Our school is also proud to collaborate and partner with the  following organizations to better meet the needs of our students.   - Eibs Pond, New York City Parks Department Partnerships for Parks, Sanitation Department – composting project, 1 st  Lego League robotics, Eco schools, US Green Ribbon schools, Flushing Meadow and All American Soap Box Derby, SI  Tech HS, Catskill Watershed, Project Learning Tree, Staten Island Mental Health, YMCA, Smart Amp, CELF, IS 227.   27% of our populations are students with disabilities and 8% of the students are ELL’s. PS 57 also shares space with  District 75 and houses an auditory program for students in K-5. We are currently focusing on lifting the level of  engagement for our students with disabilities and for our ELL population to ensure that they are engaged in rigorous  instruction to meet the Common Core standards and become English Language Proficient. There are currently 56 ELL  students, 15 merging, 15 transitioning, 16 expanding, and 3 commanding. There are various languages spoken such as  Spanish, Mandarin, Hausa, Arabic, and Turkish. The countries of origin are various, such as Dominican Republic, Egypt,  Ghana, France, Liberia, Pakistan, and Solomon Islands. Some ELL students have learning disabilities. Fifteen ELL  students are in a bilingual self contained classrooms. Students with disabilities are in a self contained class, ICT, or  receive SETTS.      This will be our second school year under the Community School 21st Century grant. Additional learning in an out of  school time environment promotes critical thinking and problem solving in a more creative setting. Art, music, dance  are ways students can learn in a more relaxed environment and strengthen their learning skill set. Homework help  assists the parents with assignments parents may not know how to help with. It provides more family time at home.  Since this is our second year as a community school we are continuing to strive for improvement in the school day  due to extended learning time out of school. When children are out of the classroom, and get additional assistance  they think of the learning process differently and embrace it more. They are in a more relaxed setting. Children who  come to school every day focus better and have better learning habits.         3.

We are currently focusing on lifting the level of  engagement for our students with disabilities and for our ELL population to ensure that they are engaged in rigorous  instruction to meet the Common Core standards and become English Language Proficient. There are 56 ELL students  at P.S. 57. There are 6 Entering students, 15 Emerging students, 16 Transitioning, 16 Expanding students, and 3  Commanding students. There are various languages spoken, such as Spanish, Mandarin, Hausa, Arabic, and Turkish.  The countries of origin are various, such as Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ghana, France, Liberia, Pakistan, and Solomon  Islands. Some ELL students have learning disabilities. Fifteen ELL students are in a bilingual self-contained classroom.  Students with disabilities are in a self-contained class, ICT, or receive SETTS.   P.S. 57 has a large special education population consisting of more than 200 students that have an IEP and receive  mandated services. Our goal is to maintain students in the LRE and provide the necessary supports and programs to  maintain students as such.    We have an ICT class on each grade for a total of 7 classes ranging from Pre-K - 5. The Pre-K is an 8:1:1 setting and the  remaining K-5 are a 12:1 setting. These classes provide an integrated setting whereby general education and special  education students work collaboratively with the support of two teachers. This service is provided on a full and part  time basis.    We have (6) 12:1:1 bridge classes which are self-contained. They range in grade from K-5. Each class is staffed with 1  teacher and 1 paraprofessional. This setting services students who have academic and/or behavioral management  needs that interfere with the instructional process to the point that additional adult support is warranted to engage  students and provide specialized instruction to meet their specific needs.   We have (2) Spanish Bilingual self-contained classes. One is a 12:1:1 grade K-2 and the other is a 12:1 grade 3-5.  These classes provide intensive language development in both English and Spanish. English is taught as a second  language. Students in these programs display deficiencies in academics in both their native language as well as  English. The goal is to increase the students’ level of independent functioning within the total school environment.   We have (2) Hearing Impaired classes. Each are 12:1:1. One class is a K-2 and the other is a 3-5.   We have (1) SETSS teacher who services 15 students. Students are serviced as a push-in as well as a small group pull  out program. Sessions consist of a 45-minute period. Students receive small group support in ELA, Math or both  ranging from 3-5 times per week.      Related Services:   We have full time therapists for (5) speech, (1) counseling, (2) occupational therapy, (1) physical therapy and (1)  adaptive physical education. All mandated students receive services according to their IEP’s according to an  established schedule. Related service providers record attendance into SESIS regularly.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Elements of the framework for great schools that we have made progress in this year center around effective school  leadership, collaborative teachers, and rigorous instruction. As a new community school we have strengthened our  vision we have begun to build trust and bring cohesiveness to the building. With this vision we have created  collaboration with teachers through common planning time, vertical team meetings, professional development team,  and inter-visitations with coach support. Through the utilization of common core aligned programs teachers align and  create curriculum that is rigorous, challenging, and standard based. Additionally, the use of the Danielson Framework  for teaching affords the administration the opportunity to engage teachers in meaningful dialogue around best  practices.   Moving forward as a school community we are looking to strengthen our family/community ties by creating new  partnerships with community based organizations to promote the well being of the whole child. Creating additional  teams within the school building to promote family engagement and build on our school culture to continue to make  students and parents feel supported.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R057   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   710   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   "Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Hubert H. Humphrey, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community."      Hubert H. Humphrey will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Additional learning in and out of school time environment promotes critical thinking and problem solving in a more  creative setting. Art, music,and dance are ways students can learn in a more relaxed environment and strengthen  their learning skill set. Homework help assists the parents with assignments that parents may not know how to help  with. It provides more family time at home. Since this is our second year as a community school we strive for  improvement in all academic areas as well as daily attendance.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, PS 57 will increase parent engagement, as evidenced by 40% of parents participating in parent teacher  conferences   By June 2019, PS 57 in partnership will increase the participation in our after school by a total of at least 50 students  as compared to the 2017-2018 school year.   By June 2019, we will increase our parent participation in family events/workshops by 10% as compared to our  attendance in 2017-2018         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  ELT: When children are out of the classroom, and get additional assistance they think of the learning process  differently and embrace it more. They are in a more relaxed setting.  Attendance Supports: Children who come to school every day focus better and have better learning habits.  Family Engagement: Parents who see a school is committed to not only their child but to their whole family will  support the school and participate more in their child’s education, volunteer more and engage other parents in the  success of the school. Family room for parents to exercise, use computers, and participate in workshops we will  provide  Health & Wellness: Proving as many services in school so parents do not have to take their child out of school will  only benefit the child. Information sessions on various health and wellness topics will serve to educate parents.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to  support your school’s instructional focus.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual   2.   3.   4.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   The CSD will assist in determining the needs of the school, students, parents and the community as a whole and work  with other CBOs to provide services. The CSD will ensure attendance issues are addressed with the School Team and  ensure parent support is provided. The CSD will also ensure that OST programming is available and structured to  provided ELT to participants. Once student services are determined we will actively work to ensure that those services  are provided so as not to take away from critical learning time. The CSD will work with outside organizations to secure  programming that supports our students needs. Since we have an extended OST learning program services may be  provided during this time as well. .Weekly staff meetings and attendance meetings have already begun and these  meetings have been scheduled throughout the school year. The staff meetings will focus on community and parent  engagement, services needed and outreach for these services. Attendance meetings will focus on parent outreach to  determine what parents need to assist with getting their child to school on a case by case basis. We will also utilize  success mentors who will be partnered a small group of children and work with them on a daily basis. The success  mentors will follow up with the families in regards to attendance issues or improvements on a weekly basis. The  success mentors will report to the CSD and AP weekly. The parent advisory meets monthly to discuss event,  workshops, and curriculum needs.   .         Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners  1.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

Students will be learning and sharing information about different cuisines  because it is something that most can relate to.  We want to give our students the voice to  confidently share their love and knowledge of popular dishes within their culture.   We will also  be learning about the different food groups and healthy eating.  Our participating students will  eventually become the teachers as they share and teach others from direct, personal, cultural  experiences.  Through this medium, students will develop the 4 modalities of language,  speaking, listening, reading, and writing to produce informative writing pieces and oral  presentations.  Students will conduct interviews with their family members to find out how home  dishes are prepared, research in books and on Internet sources to trace the roots of the dish,  produce step-by-step, sequential writing of the recipes (keeping a cooking journal), and develop  a persuasive piece in which the student will encourage others to try the dish.    24 students will take part of the program.  We will be targeting our 2nd to 5th grade ELLs who  have been receiving ENL services for 3 or more years and/or have not moved in proficiency  level for 2 or more years.  These students have also scored a 9 or below in the writing section for  the NYSESLAT.    The Title lll Cooking program will be held on Thursdays from 2:35pm - 5:05pm and start on  January 3rd for 18 sessions ending on May 23rd.  One teacher is certified in ENL. The other  teacher has a common branch license and is currently our literacy coach. We will also need a  supervisor on site as there will be no other program taking place during the hours of the Title III  program.    The language of instruction will be English.  However, the ENL teacher is fluent in Spanish and  can assist Spanish speaking students who are struggling understanding the instructions by  providing further explanation in Spanish.  Students will have bilingual dictionaries  available.  Translated take home materials will also be available to students to facilitate  conversations with their families when the work requires interviewing and research within their  own families.  The program teachers will utilize the team-teaching and station teaching co- teaching models with the ENL teacher focusing more on supporting the language using graphic  organizers and using language structures and functions.  The common branch teacher will focus  on reading skills and other literacy strategies.    Students will research different cultures through the Internet, literature and first hand  experiences. Students will create a recipe book of popular foods from the culture they  researched.  Students will make the recipes in groups. They will measure ingredients, learn about  food groups, explore measurements and temperature, and work on listening and speaking skills.  Parents will be invited to 3 open houses to join the students in sharing a cooking experience.  They will be grouped to allow a balance of proficiency levels.  This will allow students to learn  from one another so that less proficient students can have their more proficient peers as language  models.  Students will lead group discussions with teachers as facilitators.

Students will be grouped as a whole during mini lessons and then break into two smaller groups  during practice and application.  Therefore, there will be a 1:12 teacher/student ratio.    Parents will be notified of all events relating to the program in their home language, rubrics will  be used to measure student progress as it relates to speaking, listening, reading, and writing in  English.  Tasks will require students to speak and write for information and understanding.  All  rubrics will be translated to the preferred language.

This component is at no cost to the Title III  program.  These PDs will positively impact the progress of ELLs because we know that there are  English Language Learners sitting in every classrooms, whether they are entitled to the services  or not.  Additionally, the strategies used to teach ENL can be beneficial to a non-ELL.  Sharing  strategies across the board will allow for some consistency within the buildings to provide  scaffolds for our ELLs.  Students will benefit from multiple and consistent exposure to these  scaffolds and strategies.    The ENL teacher, who will be providing the PDs, will attend all PDs presented by the Office of  English Language Learners and Central.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             There are 53 ELLs and 7 commanding students who are still entitled to services.  Therefore,  there are 60 ELLs currently receiving services in our school this year. We extend our parent  involvement to their parents and families to ensure their full engagement in the educational  process. Parents of the Title III program will be invited to 3 open classes where they will work  alongside their student in the preparation and presentation of the recipes. Parents will be  identified as guest speakers to talk about their culture and heritage. They will also share their  recipes as an integral part of the learning process. ENL teachers are always available to discuss  the ELL curriculum and to provide additional information for the parents.      The ELL teacher, literacy coach, math coach will also provide parent workshops for our ELL  students. Topics include preparing ELL students for standardized exams, strategies to build  literacy and math skills at home, and information about the Common Core Standards and  citywide expectations.  Notices will be sent home to parents in their native language informing  them of the these workshops. The rational for these parent workshops would be to keep our ENL  parents abreast of what is happening in their home language and also to share strategies they can  use within the home in their home language that can easily be transferred to what and how the  students are learning in school.  Parents are also informed of these workshops in the parent  newsletter  that is sent home monthly and text blasts in their native language.  Translation  services will be available during all workshops. Additionally, any major family event organized  by the Parent Coordinator will have interpreters present to assist parents of ENL students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities      There will be 3 workshops.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses TCRWP to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Students are assessed through the following components  of TCRWP: letter identification, letter sounds, high frequency words, comprehension, fluency and re-tell. Teachers keep  running records, conference notes, goal sheets, and TCWRP Reading levels. All this information is put into TC ASSESSMENT  PRO. Our school has the Achieve 3000 computer program that assesses students reading Lexicon levels.   All our students are  also assessed throughout the year using period assessments.  Other early literacy assessment tools used are WRAP.  Teachers  also use a pre-test and end of module assessments using NYS Modules from EngageNY.  The results of these assessments drive  instruction. Teachers provide differentiated instruction to meet the needs of each student. Data shows the majority of the ELLs  require intensive intervention. We also assess our ELLs using the Spanish LAB and ELE for those students who are  eligible.  Additionally, we use ELL periodic assessments.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to administer these assessments to our ELLS, we ensure that the students are taking the tests in a separate location  where they can take their time to complete them.  We make sure that we implement all of the accommodations and test  modifications as detailed in the IEPs of SWDs as permitted in the School Administrator's Manual for the test.  When  permissible, assessments can be read, reread, and clarified in the students' NL and/or the assessment itself can be provided in  the NL.  Additionally, school leadership ensures that the staff is implementing the structures that have determined ELLs needs  by having periodic meetings with the Assistant Principal who is the direct supervisor of the ENL/Bilingual staff to review  student needs and discuss all measures that are taking place to accommodate and serve the child.  All measures are  documented, reviewed, and approved amongst the Assistant Principal and the ENL/Bilingual staff.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The ENL coordinator has ATS access and continuously references it for state assessment results including the NYSESLAT.  The  ENL coordinator prints out the NYSESLAT scores and provides them to the bilingual teachers for their particular students.  We  evaluate the success of our program by cross-evaluating the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, and the NYC baseline and  Periodic Assessment programs for ELLs. The school also uses Achieve3000 to consistently monitor students' progress and areas  of need.  Teachers use TC and WRAP as baseline measures.  The ENL and Bilingual Education teachers utilize the the ELL Data  Analysis Tool (EDAT) to look for patterns in students' learning and track their progressions throughout the years.  These  teachers keep and continuously update their data binders and share these assessment findings with classroom teachers.  ELL  staff also have access to the results of assessments that the mainstream teachers are administering.  All these assessments are  cross-referenced among all teaching staff who work with the particular students.    Data from the NYSITELL is used as a baseline to highlight student academic strengths and weaknesses.  The NYSITELL gives us a  clearer picture of what level the student is on in the different modalities (speaking, listening, reading, and writing).  We work  with students to strengthen their abilities.  We do this within the general education classrooms, in the ENL/Bilingual  classrooms as well as in our Title III program and at-risk services.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    At the beginning of the school year, the ENL coordinator gathers all summative assessment data, including NYS exam  scores, and meets with the ELL staff supervisor, who is the assistant principal.  Together they cross-reference the data and  discuss trends and student needs and devise an action plan of interventions and academic goals for each student.  Students  are then, re-grouped accordingly within their general education classes as well as the ENL/Bilingual  classes.  Groups maintain their balance with its members contributing to their strengths and building on their  weaknesses.  These assessments also help determine the participants of our Title III after school program and our  RTI/AIS programs.    ENL professional development sessions are provided to all teachers to learn to ask questions about student ability, learning  styles, and learning patterns.  These sessions raise awareness on how to distinguish between learning disabilities and an  English language deficit and/or cultural differences.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school is using the Go Math and New York State Modules program in grades k-5 which have  RTI embedded in every  lesson.  In ELA, teachers use the TC reading levels to guide their instruction.  In addition to that they also use their formative  assessments to group and differentiate instruction.    During the Integrated ENL sessions, the ENL and classroom teacher work hand-in-hand to cater instruction for  the ELLs.  Scaffolds are put into place for the ELLs to help deconstruct text and build comprehension.  We use the Can-Do  indicators based on Shelley Fairbairn's book Differentiating Instruction and Assessments for English Language Learners: A  Guide for K-12 Teachers to ensure that every ELL, regardless of their level of proficiency, is able to participate in activities (e.g.  point; draw pictures and label;, show their understanding through alternative methods such as an oral presentation, create   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         reports with a mix of text and illustrations; build oral fluency using sentence frames and structures).    Most of the ELLs are in classrooms where the Spalding program is being used in grades k-2.  It's a language arts program that is  interactive and multisensory, allowing ELLs to participate fully in spelling, reading, and writing.  Additionally, PS57 has the  LINC program where older students read to students in the lower grades, building self-confidence and a collaborative spirit.  It  gets students comfortable hearing themselves read and hearing how a more fluent reader sounds.    During the Stand-Alone sessions, the ENL teacher focuses on building oral fluency that are both rich in language and grade  specific content, which will in turn improve students' writing skills.  The method by which students accomplish this is through  interactive read aloud, role playing, vocabulary instruction, and collaborative discussions.    Classroom teachers try to get as many of the curriculum books/texts in the students NL.  The computers and laptops in the  classrooms give students instant access to bilingual dictionaries online.  The bilingual classrooms also have bilingual leveled  libraries.  ELLs have been strategically placed in classes that have the support of two classroom teachers.  The ENL teacher  provides monthly professional development to learn how to work with and engage ELLs.    The ENL teacher works with the classroom teachers to provide training on different language prompts and graphic organizers  they can use with ELLs in order to consolidate their thinking and use these scaffolds to be able to participate in conversation  and/or produce written work.    The teaching staff will use the "can-do indicators" learned at a professional learning session to have a better understanding of  what students can do specific to where they are on their own progression scale of English language learning.  With tasks that  are more appropriate to what the ELL is able to do, we will be able to assess him/her more fairly.  These are the tasks that  need to be graded to show a more accurate picture of the students' abilities and allow the teacher to adjust his/her curriculum  to address the gaps that are revealed in the data.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   School leadership and staff routinely examine the results of the NYSESLAT to identify trends over the previous 3 years.  We can  see the breakdown of scores per student based on the different modalities, to determine where each student's strengths and  areas of struggle lie.   We use this data to choose "can-do indicators" to assess students during their lessons.  PS 57 uses data  from the NYSESLAT to schedule the amount of minutes students need of ENL direct instruction.  We also cross-reference this  data with the ELA and Math to get a broader picture of academic strengths and weaknesses.  Additionally, the ENL teacher  draws information from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to analyze patterns in students' progress.  With the EDAT, we are  able to identify the long-term ELLs and plan accordingly to see how we can move them along the continuum of language  academic development.  We also use data from Achieve3000 because students are able to take reading and comprehension  assessments in English and, in many cases, in their native language.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher attends grade common planning meetings where she disseminates the findings of the ATS exam history  reports such as the NYSESLAT which help to create the scaffolds to go with their instructional units.  The data is also shared  with the classroom teacher and advised on groupings within each classroom.  The ENL teacher also includes this information in  the ENL professional development workshops provided in the school for all teachers.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL program has 51 ELLs. Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction during  the scheduled school day as required under CR Part 154. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes  per week of ENL instruction during the scheduled school day. Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL  instruction.  ELLs are grouped into one class per grade making it possible for the integrated ENL instruction. These  blocks are heterogeneously grouped and of mixed proficiency levels.   For all grades, the following is provided:  Entering Level - 4 periods of Stand-Alone ENL, 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA  Emerging Level - 4 periods of Stand-Alone ENL, 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA  Transitioning Level - 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA  Expanding Level - 4 periods of ENL/ELA  Commanding Level - 2 periods of Integrated ENL   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The bilingual Spanish Special Education program can contain 12 students per class. The school has two self-contained  classes. One class is K through 2nd grade, 12:1:1, and the other class is 3 through 5th grade, 12:1. These classes are  heterogeneously grouped and mixed proficiency levels with differentiated instruction. The k-2 teacher, Judith  Maisonave, is NYS licensed and certified Bilingual Spanish Special Education teacher and the 3-5 teacher, Carolyn  Reid, is NYS licensed and certified in Special Education with an extension in ENL.  Their schedule follows the CR Part  154 mandated schedule.    Each level adheres to the following schedule:  Entering - Monday through Friday 4 periods of Stand-Alone ENL, 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA, 45 minutes of Home  Language Arts (HLA) and 2 bilingual content areas being science and social studies  Emerging - Monday through Friday 6 periods of Stand-Alone ENL, 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA, 45 minutes of  HLA and 2 bilingual content areas being science and social studies  Transitioning - Monday through Friday 4 periods of Stand-Alone ENL, 45 minutes of Home Language Arts (HLA) and 1  bilingual content areas being science  Expanding - Monday through Friday 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA, 45 minutes of Home Language Arts (HLA) and 1  bilingual content areas being science.  Currently, there are no commanding students in the Bilingual program, however, if we do happen to enroll a  commanding student who is still entitled to receive 2 years of ENL services, the bilingual teacher will provide 2 periods  of Stand Alone ENL.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time P.S. 57 does not have a Dual Language program because we do not have the sufficient number of  students in any one grade with enough native speakers of the same language to create a class.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each  program with schedules approved by the instructional specialists assigned to our school.  It is also reviewed by the compliance  specialist assigned to our borough. We track and maintain compliance using the STARS system and reviewing the ELL Data  Update Report.  Entering and Emerging students receive periods of ENL instruction per week, Transitioning and Expanding  students receive four periods of ENL instruction per week, and Commanding students receive two periods of ENL instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      per week during the school day.   All schedules are in compliance with CR Part 154. The  ENL program at P.S. 57 delivers instruction in English 100% of the time  by our New York State licensed and certified ENL teacher. Common Core Language Standards are used to teach English in a  content based cross curriculum format using ENL methodologies. Standard based instruction is implemented in the four  modalities of language skill: speaking, listening, reading and writing in English. The following scaffolding techniques are used to  prepare students for the NYSESLAT; modeling, bridging, schema building, text representation, meta cognition and self  assessment with rubrics.   Home Language Arts is implemented in the two bilingual Spanish classes. These classes follow the Transitional Bilingual New  York State mandates and provide one period of Home Language Arts instruction delivered per week. The schedule reflects the  mandates of CR Part 154.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The ENL program delivers instruction in English during integrated and standalone minutes. The program uses the Scott  Foresman ESL by Accelerating English Language Learning to deliver instruction in content areas during standalone instruction.  This program is multicultural and activity centered. Our program also uses  "Let's Sing About It". This is a program by Mondo  that enriches language and fluency through songs.  All programs are aligned with the NYS Learning Standards.  ENL teachers  provide a lot of visuals to help make content comprehensible.  We teach through songs, TPR, chants, and provide re-worded  text along with the original text in order to increase comprehension and build vocabulary.  Additionally, we use assistive  technology to scan and translate academic text to students' native language.             In both ENL and Bilingual program models, students are exposed to grade level reading text, however we use graphic  organizers, sentence frames and structures, cloze activities, and use SMARTboard technologies to support the content with  pictures and audio.  In the bilingual classroom, the teachers use native language to make content comprehensible as well as  many visuals and chants to get the students to internalize the information.  Classroom and ENL teachers also monitor students'  reading comprehension growth through Achieve3000, which provides grade level content on different reading levels.  Many of  the scaffolding ideas, we draw from Engage NY (scaffolding for ELLs) for both ELA and math.          The Bilingual Programs deliver instruction in both English and Spanish according to the mandated minutes charted for  proficiency levels.  Grades K through 2 use TC for reading and writing, Fundations Recipe for Reading, and Math Exemplars.  Grades 3 through 5 use Engage NY for Math, TC for Reading and Writing, strategic Math and Math Exemplars.  These programs  are aligned with the NYS Learning  Standards.  All lessons are introduced in Spanish  and proceed to be taught and applied in  English.  Math is taught in Spanish and then in English.  Everyday students get a period of reading in the native language and  one period in English.  (Programs will change in September).     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       P.S. 57 administers the 'Examen de Lectura en Espanol' - (ELE) every year. The purpose of this exam is to assess the Spanish  reading proficiency of native speakers who are receiving language arts instruction in their native language. The results of this  test are used to drive instruction in Spanish in the Bilingual Spanish program.   We also provide, when accessible, some of the  state assessments in the native language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     SIFE students get the required number of minutes for ENL stand alone and integrated. The child's classroom is equipped  with a picture dictionary, native language books, leveled books, books on tapes, earphones and access to Achieve 3000, which  has the option of reading aloud to the student while he/she follows along.  The student participates in AIS and Title III.  We  also allow flexible scheduling for the student so that he can attend one period per day in a lower grade during the ENL  teacher's stand alone session with a lower grade or while the ENL teacher is integrating in a lower grade to begin filling the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      gaps of his/her interrupted education.  For both ENL and Bilingual program models, a major differentiating instruction tool is  training teachers to use the "can-do indicators" to design tasks that are appropriate to students' abilities and tailor their  lessons to meet SIFE students are in their academic abilities.  We get to know our SIFE students, first, with the Oral interview  and then the MLS to understand what has been the students' academic experiences.  Professional learning opportunities are  also provided for the school teaching staff to learn strategies for working SIFE students.  The school is also strengthening the  collaborative relationship between the SIFE students' families and the school.  PS 57 is now a community school and we are  trying to forge a stronger relationship with the SIFE families as well as newcomer families to feel more welcomed and more  comfortable approaching school staff with questions, providing interpretation services, encouraging them to participate in our  GED and ENL classes at the school.      b- The newcomer receives the mandated 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction per week. The ENL teacher works closely  with the classroom teacher and provides the newcomer with materials such as a picture dictionary, a newcomer workbook,  books on tapes, native language books.  These students participate in AIS, SETSS and supplemental instructional support  through Title III.  The classroom teacher is also equipped with "can do" indicators for working and engaging the newcomer  regardless of his/her level of proficiency.  When possible, newcomers are also paired with another student who speaks the  same native language, to be escorted around the school, to use as support when they have questions about teacher  expectations in class assignments, and to help lower the affective filter.  This is especially important during the first days of  school.  Both the ENL and Bilingual program models are sensitive to the challenges our newcomers encounter.  Some of the  challenges are adjusting to different/new routines and teaching/learning styles in the American school system, diverse cultural  differences, new language and setting.  As we are now a community school, we are encouraging families to partake in the  many school and family programs, including wellness classes, ENL and GED classes for adults, connecting the families to  various resources, such as help with medical insurance, access to medical practitioners, etc.  At the beginning of the school  year, the ENL staff holds a parent orientation for newcomer families and shares information on the resources available to  them and provides a list of key school personnel and where they are located within the school building.    c - In both the ENL and Bilingual programs, developing students are in intensive remediation focusing on higher order  thinking concepts and questioning. They are strategically partnered or grouped with more fluent speakers in their classroom  who they can converse with during turn-and-talk activities.  These opportunities to negotiate meaning of texts and questions  and discuss ideas, will allow students move along the continuum of the English language fluency.     d- At this time, PS 57 does not have any long term ELLs because PS 57 only goes up to 5th grade.  Long term ELLs are 7th year  ELLs.    e - Our former ELLs continue to receive the mandated 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction for two years. The ENL  teacher continues to monitor their progress and teaches students how to complete tasks a bit more independently by  removing some of the scaffolds provided and self-assessing.  Currently, none of the students in our bilingual program are  former ELLs.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers of ELL-SWD  use in our school is the TC Reading and Writing  curriculum for grades Kindergarten, first and second. This program is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers adapt the lessons to IEP goals.  ELLs, including ELL-SWD, are placed in classrooms with two teachers, one of which has received training in Spalding and works  with students on phonics and reading in grades k-2 and select 3rd grade classes.  They have the extra support with 2 classroom  teachers, the ENL teacher, who pushes in the required number of minutes per week, and some classes have a  paraprofessional.  RTI  and ELL specific activities are embedded in the program. This program is aligned with the Common Core Learning  Standards. Teachers adapt the lessons to IEP goals.   Our school offers the technology program called Achieve 3000 that is accessible to all ELLs including ELL-SWD. Title III offers  small groups and individualized supplemental support to all Ells. We have a SETSS teacher that offers additional instructional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      support during the school day.  The IEP teacher provides AIS to at risk students using SPIRE and Reading Recovery, some of which may be ELLs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          The ENL teacher is in close contact with the classroom teacher and all other providers to make sure the individual needs  are met and followed as indicated on the students IEP. When the ENL teacher has standalone time, the ELL-SWD  are in  heterogeneous groups with mainstream students. Groups are from 8 to 10 students.  All work is aligned with Common Core  Learning Standards. ELLs are in ICT classes, therefore, all integrated mandated minutes are done in the ICT class at every grade  level.  If a student's IEP mandates it, he/she will also receive Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS).     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All of our curricula, TC and NYS Modules on EngageNY, have intervention and instructional strategies embedded within each  lesson.  Spanish math workbooks are provided for Spanish speaking students.  Achieve 3000 provides intervention in language  arts by providing grade level reading content in Spanish as well.  These types of interventions are currently not available in  other languages, however EngageNY and Achieve3000 can be tailored to meet students where they are academically without  sacrificing grade level content providing instructional strategies for ELLs.  RTI and AIS are offered to students in need of the extra support, and that includes some of our ELLs and ELL-SWD.  We also  have a SETTs teacher who works with some ELL-SWDs and provides at-risk services as well to Tier II and Tier III students.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Armed with the information learned in professional development regarding differentiated instruction for ELLs, the school will  provide more targeted professional development for all teachers to work out plans for integrating and engaging all ELLs within  the classroom.  The ENL teacher also plans on taking ELL students on more school trips to increase students' learning through  first-hand experiences and increasing students' oral language.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?  We have a bilingual special education program and it is still active.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs are grouped in ICT classes and have access to the same programs and materials that all other students have.  For  example, our school continues to use ILLUMNIART Productions, funded by the Staten Island Foundation and the Staten Island  ART for grades 3-5 including ELLs, this program highlights character traits and development through the art of play  writing, music and lots of images.  Students work in collaborative groups, which helps support all ELLs including ELL-SWDs to  make content comprehensible. All classes participate in a range of different programs offered school-wide.  All classes,  including the ELLs who are in those classes, have access to the programs and participate.  We are partnering with the  organization enACT, which teach students theatre competencies and social-emotional skills. This will help our ELLs develop  oral fluency.    We have an award winning robotics team at our school where our science teacher includes ELLs.  Students learn to build their  own soap box derby and compete with other students all over New York City.  Our school also has a SETTS teacher who picks  up children for additional support. Our school offers after school Title III that is available to all ELLs. This program is an  academic and enrichment cooking program one day a week after school. The YMCA provides an after school program, in which  many of the ELLs partake and they help the students with homework.    All after school and supplemental programs are offered to every child at P.S. 57, including ELLs. The Parent Coordinator sends  school notices and letters in familys' preferred language of communication. A phone call is also made to parents and guardians  to clarify any notices or programs that are being offered, if needed. After school programs sponsored by the YMCA and Title III  cooking program is offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59        The Assistant Principal, who is the direct supervisor for the ELL/Bilingual programs, ensure that services and programs are  inclusive and have a good representation of all of our subgroups.  ENL and bilingual teachers keep track of what programs and  services their students are partaking in and provide periodic updates to the supervisor   to see if further outreach to the families needs to be made.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support the Ells in the ENL classroom during Standalone time (180 min per week for Entering  and Emerging) include Scott Foresman's E.S.L., RAZ-Kids, Accelerated English Language, Breakthrough to Literacy by McGraw  Hill. and Let's Sing About It by Mondo. In Math we use the Reading Word Problems. The students are immersed in content  reading in Social Studies, Geography, and Vocabulary Connection. Grades 3-5 use content area reading standard based  materials. Computer technology programs include Achieve 3000, Starfall, FrontRow and Snap&Read, which is a program that  takes pictures of any text and translates it into other languages. The ENL class has a multilingual library including books in  Spanish, Chinese, and Urdu.  Instructional materials used to support the ELLs in the Bilingual Spanish classes include Scholastic En Espanol for Science and  Social Studies.  They also use Wonder Readers in Spanish. These classes have bilingual libraries and Spanish translations of  tests.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered in the ENL program 25% of the time in Spanish by the ENL teacher  to clarify concepts if  needed. Home language support is delivered in the Transitional Bilingual Spanish program on a sliding scale according to  mandates, 75% Spanish and 25 % English in the first trimester, 50% Spanish and 50% English in the second trimester and 25%  Spanish and 75% English in the last trimester. Spanish is used in the content areas.  These classes have bilingual libraries and  content area materials. Practice tests are also translated in Spanish.    The bilingual classes also take the ELE tests every year,  which assesses students' Spanish fluency.  Achieve 3000 also provides literacy in many of the languages represented within the  school.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. During stand-alone sessions, students are picked up  and grouped with 2 grade levels at a time. Materials correspond to the grade levels. The ENL teacher along with the classroom  teacher uses scaffolding techniques to make grade level content comprehensible.  Differentiated instruction is delivered  according to needs.  Our administration reviews all schedules of service providers to make sure they are all in compliance and  meeting mandates.  Also, we receive periodic ELL Data Update Reports that verify our continued compliance according to the  CR-Part 154 Chancellor's Regulation.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 57 does not currently share a building with any other school.  We utilize the entire space.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are Newcomers. These students receive the mandated instructional minutes during the scheduled school  day according to C R Part 154.The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to make sure the student's needs are  met. There is a Newcomer Center provided by the ENL teacher that includes a picture dictionary and a Native language  dictionary if needed. Before the school year begins, materials are gathered and provided to the classroom teacher to be able  to fully engage the newcomers in their classrooms.    Besides the newcomer center provided in the classroom, the ENL teacher has a special orientation class. The newcomers are  taken on a tour of the school. The ENL teacher takes them to the cafeteria, auditorium, the gym, the nurse, the office, and  shows them where the boys and girls bathrooms are. The students walk the halls and are introduced to the computer   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         teacher, school nurse, music teacher, dance teacher, and science teacher. The newcomers walk up and down the stairs and the  ENL teacher points out the arrows painted on the walls showing up and down directions.    The Parent Coordinator makes sure to send letters, invitations, notices to families in their preferred language.  Since we are  now a community school, many things are being made available to families, including our newcomers, to facilitate access to  services such as dental care, social emotional wellness, vision care, food pantry, all within the school.  Therefore, newcomers  can continue their education, without the risk of gaps in other important areas of their lives. The Virtual Y and our school  nurses also assist with all students to provide services in their respective areas.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered at our school at the present time, as this is an elementary school and language  electives are not required.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   There is no Dual Language program offered at our school at the present time because there were not  enough parents who requested it in any one grade level and with the same native language to be able to  constitute the minimum number of native speakers in a dual language class.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel at our school include the ENL teacher,  Bilingual Special Education teachers, all ICT classroom teachers K-5,  speech teachers, guidance, secretaries, paraprofessionals, and parent coordinator.  The ENL teacher provides in-house PD for  these individuals two Mondays every month.  One session is for k-2 teachers and the other is for 3-5 teachers.  The ENL  teacher as well as the Bilingual Education teachers attend district wide professional development workshops.    Every Monday there is extended day Professional Learning at PS 57 for all the teachers, including teachers of ELLs. These  workshops are given by the Literacy Coach, Math Coach, and ENL teacher.   Workshops will be scheduled to meet the new  mandates of CRPart 154 (15%  ENL workshops for teachers of ELLs)  Workshops are also given to all of the above staff based on the current curriculum the school is using. These programs  encompass methodologies for ELL students. Professional learning is also geared toward the competencies of Danielson which  support student achievement for all students inclusive our ELLs.   All professional learning is around the Common Core Learning Standards, Danielson, RTI, technology, analyzing data, and  student achievement. Our September through December professional learning included Chancellor's regulations, MOSL and  rubrics, State Testing, MOSL analysis, Sanford Harmony social emotional growth, Go Math, using Achieve3000 and Front Row  technology programs in the classroom. Professional Learning from January through June are vocabulary development as per  Chancellor recommendation, Core Collaborative district initiative, MOSL analysis, State testing, Learning Intentions and success  criteria, Danielson competencies, language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  Other topics for ENL professional  development would be distinguishing between language deficit and a disability, and the Nuts & Bolts of the ENL program.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         The Department of Education Website has a library of videos for additional support for classroom teachers, out of classroom  providers, and paraprofessionals of ELLs.  50% of the workshops are based on ENL topics for ENL and bilingual education  teachers.    ENL and Bilingual Teachers will receive their own PDs at the district level in addition to any PDs offered by the state.  Calendar  of PDs which will be provided:  October - Can-Do Indicators  November - Integrating language and content  December -  Developing vocabulary  January - Scaffolding Language  February - Developing oral fluency leads to a great writer  March - The power of graphic organizers  April - The power of sentence frames and sentence starters  May - A language deficit or a disability?  June - Increasing ELL family engagement     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   Teachers are responsible for logging their professional learning hours. The administration maintains a professional learning  plan and a binder with the activities and sign in sheets. We are able to meet the requirements during the Monday 80 minutes  professional learning time. The ENL room also keeps copies of attendance, agendas, and professional development  handouts.  The school will meet the required 15% ELL-specific professional development for all teacher and the %50 ELL- specific professional development for ENL/Bilingual teachers as per CR Part 154.2 by ensuring the PDs are taking place, logging  the hours, and providing certificates of participation so that participants can also keep track.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At the beginning of the school year, parents attend an orientation meeting with the ENL and/or Bilingual Teachers  to discuss  the goals of the program.  We will explain the natural language progression of children.  At individual meetings throughout the  school year, teachers will discuss the student's language development progress, review language proficiency assessment  results, and discuss next steps for parents and teachers to work together to help the student move along in their continuum of  language development.   Parents will be presented with the results of the NYC ENL Interim Assessment in addition to some of  the assessment results from the classroom teacher, including math, social studies, science, and the student's other teachers  such as dance and technology.  These assessments will help provide a well-rounded picture of the students' academic  strengths and weaknesses.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents will be invited to one orientation at the beginning of the school year to meet with the ENL teacher and discuss the  program’s goal for the year.  It will be a time to get to know the families and encourage them to attend school meetings and  events. They will be provided with a language card they can use whenever they go to the school, which indicates their personal  language choice for communication so that the school can provide an interpreter. The ENL/Bilingual department at PS 57 will  also provide two workshops throughout the school year.  One will focus on strengthening the school-to-home connection  in ELA and the other will focus on math.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Karyn Lind, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Hubert H.

Yes/No    Language Access   Coordinator? Yes/No               * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess the schools written translation and oral interpretation needs comes  from the languages spoken by the parents and guardians of the students at our school. This data is generated by  the RHLA list generated in ATS. This is a list of all the OTELE ALPHA Language Codes in our school. As of 10/10/13  we are showing 15 languages including English. There are 434 English speaking homes, 114 Spanish, 8 Arabic, 5  Urdu, 3 French, and 1 or 2 of 7 other languages. The other home languages are 2 Cantonese, 1 Chinese, 1 French  Haitian Creole, 2 Haussa, 2 Karen, 1 Krio, 1 Macedonian, 2 Mandarin, 4 Mandingo, 1 Russian, 1 Sinhalese, , 1  Turkish, 7 Ukrainian, and 1 Yoruba. These parents prefer English for oral and written communication.    In addition, the parent coordinator, Edwin Torres, initiates a Language Identification Survey of the primary  languages spoken by the parent of each student enrolled at our school, and if the language is not English,  translation and oral interpretation will be provided. As of today, our parents needs are Spanish and Urdu. Our  school has pedagogues fluent in these language. If another language is required the Translation and Interpretation  unit will be contacted.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Also in the main office, where the emergency cards are kept, the home language and language of communication  is identified and filed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    The major finding of our school's written  translation and oral interpretation needs  is that most of our students are from  English speaking homes, but 20% come  from Spanish speaking homes. Then we  have 12 other languages that are spoken  in our students homes, but  communication is prefered in English.  These languages are Cantonese, Chinese,  Haitian Creole, Haussa, Karen, krio,  Macedonian, Mandingo, Russian,  Sinhalese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and  Yoruba. Our school has pedagouges that  are fluent in languages other than  English. We have teachers that are fluent  in Spanish, Hindi, Urdu and Arabic. If  another language is needed for  tanslation and interpretation we contact  the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  They send someone to our school. We  have used them in the past for reasons  such as IEP meetings when the parent or  guardian needs language interpretation.  Any document that contains individual,  student specific information regarding  health, safety, legal or disciplinary  matters need also to be translated.                        3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
