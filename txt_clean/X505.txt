This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice (LGJ) is the first Urban Assembly (UA) School. At LGJ we believe in  Student Centered Learning as is evidenced in the LGJ C.H.A.R.G.E. -Collectively Helping All Realize Greatness Everyday.   Values –      We will provide all students with opportunities to think and demonstrate learning in every class, every day.    We will prepare all students for the rigors of college and career.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9        We are committed to the academic and emotional well being of all students.    We acknowledge the difficulties of adolescence and we commit to teaching students how to respond to   challenges productively.     We believe it is our collective responsibility to build a stable and consistent learning environment,rich with   common routines and rituals.     We will expect and maintain high standards of learning, professionalism and behavior while exhibiting   compassion for one another.   Vision Statement –    We are dedicated to creating an environment where halls and classrooms are made vibrant with the sights and  sounds of students thinking and learning. We strive to create civic-minded individuals who demonstrate respect for  themselves, others, and the world around them.

LGJ is unique in that we  support all scholars through a rigorous law, government and justice curriculum while sharing a campus with the Bronx  Court complex.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our teachers regularly reflect and refine their instructional practice. To that end, in classrooms administrators expect  to see teachers (School Quality Review (SQR) Indicators);    ● Create multiple opportunities for questioning that go beyond recall and recognition (3B)   ● Create opportunities for students to engage in rigorous student-to-student discussions (3B)   ● Design lessons that allow for multiple entry points for all learners (3C)   ● Monitor student learning by creating lessons that allow for multiple checks for understanding (3D)   ● Use common routines around how we agree and disagree (2C, 3B, 3D)   Each year the action steps grow out of classroom observations, through an analysis of ADVANCE for trends in practice  across the school. We analyze student performance data and develop action steps for our teacher teams and across  the school. Each summer we meet with key stakeholders to review the associated data and student outcomes in  order to revisit the action steps connected to the goals, devise our theory of action and instructional focus. We share  this information with the staff at the opening Professional Development (PD) and then meet with department and  grade team leaders to develop action plans that align to these enduring goals and connect to the action steps. This  year’s action steps are rooted in improving;     Assessment practice    Common Core Instruction and preparation for Common Core Regents    College & Career Readiness    Meeting the needs of our Students With Disabilities (SWDs) and English Language Learners (ELLs)    Reading & Writing across the curriculum   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      2018-2019 Instructional Focus   At LGJ, we promote student engagement through the creation of rigorous learning tasks, the implementation of  literacy strategies across content areas and the use of formative and summative data to tailor instruction to the  needs of all learners.    Specifically our priorities are:    Data- We will collect, analyze and use in and out of classroom assessment and data to inform instructional  decisions that specifically address current trends in student needs and monitor ongoing student progress. W   Rigor- We will develop cognitively challenging, relevant tasks that require students to experience a productive  struggle and build independence.   Literacy- We will incorporate literacy based strategies across content areas to increase student preparedness for  college, career, and advanced coursework.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school of 765 students serves 16% ELL students and 21% IEP students across grades 6-12. In the last three years,  we have had an increase in the number of newcomer ENL students who are beginning language learners and require  high level supports to access curriculum.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the 2018-2019 school year we saw the following areas of strength as measured by the 2018 Framework for Great  Schools report:     This year we showed positive growth in the areas of Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Effective   School Leadership, Strong Family & Community Ties and Trust.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Over the last five years, we have made ongoing efforts to increase classroom rigor and to provide necessary scaffolds  and supports so that the curriculum is accessible to all learners. Our preliminary Frameworks report 17-18 shows that  our Quality of Student Discussion Score was 78% positive (+4% increase) and 9% above the district wide average.  However, for the Academic Press section, our lowest scores came from teachers and students responding about  difficult questions in class. 61% of students responded that teachers asked difficult questions (+5% from last year) but  57% of teachers responded that students respond to challenging questions (-7% from last year). It is clear there is  work to do regarding the level and amount of questioning and academic rigor across classrooms.   In 2018-2019, we will continue to engage in the following to further increase student outcomes on State Exams and  summative assessments:     Use lesson refining protocol aligned to the Danielson framework to examine and provide feedback to each   other around pedagogical practice.     Analyze and extract skills embedded in state exams.    Ensure class readings/text and level are aligned to CCLS for that grade.    Use of elevated accountable talk stems that help to facilitate student to student discussions.    Use student to student discussion to promote student thinking.

LGJ boasts a robust network of supports for our students when it comes to student attendance and intervention. We  have a strong attendance team, school counseling team and social work team that works in unison to provide tiered  responses to our students across all performance and attendance levels. We currently employ the use of the DEXPRO  system which pulls together ATS attendance data with STARS course and exam data to best identify risk groups and  track progress and intervention efficacy. Counselors work closely with parents, the attendance team and our parent  coordinator to communicate student progress and monitor closely extenuating circumstances our students face. The  counselors also provide incentives and recognition events for students who are showing improvements throughout  the year both academically and in terms of attendance.   In 2017-2018, while our overall attendance rate 6-12 saw an increase of 1%, including for our IEP and Lowest Third  students, we did experience a 5% overall decrease in ENL student attendance.

In 2017-2018 we significantly increased our already strong scores in Inclusive leadership by 11% with 94% positive  responses compared to 83% just last year. Additionally, we saw our strongest rating in Instructional Leadership at  90% positive responses, which is an increase of 1% from last year and 3% over two years.   However, the Learning Environment Survey highlighted an area for growth in our professional learning community.  With regards to the question at this school "curriculum, instruction, and learning materials are well coordinated  across the different grade levels at this school." we saw only 79% positive teacher responses. While this was an 8%  increase over last year, this is still an area of focus for our collaborative work.   This prompted us to reflect on our teacher teams which meet regularly and for us to consider how we are ensuring  teachers at all levels are collaborating regularly to share and innovate in ways that support lesson delivery that  impacts student learning for all our diverse learners.    Upon digging deeper in teacher evaluation data available in ADVANCE, we explored the following areas of weakness  in teacher practice within Domain 3 to focus on and are using formal and informal observation data collected this  school year to inform how we group our teachers during professional learning time to maximize teacher  collaboration that supports student engagement and academic achievement.   2015-2016   Domain 3B: average teacher rating 2.29   Domain 3C: average teacher rating 3.78   Domain 3D: average teacher rating 3.31   Overall 15-16 average for Domain 3: 3.13   2016-2017   Domain 3B: average teacher rating 2.87   Domain 3C: average teacher rating 3.91   Domain 3D: average teacher rating 3.66   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25      Overall 16-17 average for Domain 3: 3.48   2017-2018   Domain 3B: average teacher rating 2.98   Domain 3C: average teacher rating 3.90   Domain 3D: average teacher rating 3.39   Overall 16-17 average for Domain 3: 3.42                Part 2 – Annual Goal      Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  LGJ employs rigorous hiring practices to ensure the best fit, high quality candidates for our school. Every interested  candidate must submit a teaching portfolio including a resume and recommendation letters. Once reviewed using our  portfolio rubric, the best candidates are called in for a face to face interview. Our interview panel includes the AP of  Instruction for that content area, as well as department and grade team leaders. Additional staff members may also  be called to serve on the hiring committee depending on the duties. A series of questions are prepared and scored on  a rubric and reviewed by the committee following the interview. After the rubric evaluation, selected candidates are  recommended to return and perform a demonstration lessons. Demo lessons are done in front of a class of our  students. Students are given feedback forms so that we can get their opinions as well as we consider each candidates  rating. Once we have a finalist, the Principal and AP do a final interview and review of the candidate’s credentials.      In our efforts to retain highly qualified teachers and ensure they have the supports and strategies to grow  professionally, we are highly invested in professional development. We offer professional development to teachers  through our Instructional Coaches. Our Professional Learning center also offers a range of professional development  opportunities and a space for collaboration.       Mentoring is implemented as per teacher requirements. Teachers are active participants in the process and  collaborate with administrators to review their goals and monitor progress and development. Each year,  Administration collaborates in one-on-one goal setting sessions with all individual teachers. Teachers self-assess on a  regular basis and confer with school leaders.              2b.

Instructional coaches, APs, and the Urban Assembly provide ongoing support and training in the implementation of  the CCSS.   This year during bi-weekly professional development time department teams are engaging in the following:   ● Applied use of common Department-Specific Action Plan template    ● Review of student data from content-specific State Exams   ● Analyze data from state exams and discussed implications for content-specific instruction and design.   ● Incorporate text-based questions that generate student to student discussions in lesson plans.   ● Ensure class readings/text and level were aligned to CCLS for that grade   ● Use of elevated accountable talk stems that help to facilitate student to student discussions.   ● Incorporate strategies to allow multiple entry points for all learners. For example, common modifications  embedded into units are graphic organizers for writing assignments, modified texts with defined vocabulary or built-in  comprehension questions, and additional readings for students who are exceeding standards.   ● Some departments have incorporated time in their department to share tips and strategies to incorporate  discussion techniques or to common core align specific sections of their units and/or lesson plans.   Participation in each of the above mentioned sessions is differentiated based upon teacher performance data,  observation data and teacher practice data collected through classroom walkthroughs and teacher observations.  Additionally, staff surveys and self-selected sessions are offered. Teachers are grouped flexibly throughout the year to  target their current areas for improvement and./or current problems of practice. Teacher leaders and instructional  coaches who have shown particular strength in the topic areas covered are asked to facilitate and lead training and  provide ongoing individualized coaching and support to participants.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Each year the school convenes a MOSL committee that works to select the periodic assessments for the year, as well  as assessments used for teacher evaluation purposes. The committee includes representatives from a variety of grade  levels and subject areas, the representatives are charged with collecting input from every grade/department team  and returning with team selected/informed selections. Periodic assessments are then selected for baseline,  benchmark and end of year.   Our school datacoach provides support to teachers in scoring, norming and analyzing data from assessments. He  provides teacher trainings, lunch and learns and one to one coaching opportunities in creating, scoring and analyzing  data from student assessments.   Additionally, Individual Planning Conferences between teachers and their supervising AP includes support in analyzing  baseline assessment data and goal-setting. Thereafter, one department team planning session per week is dedicated  to analysis of student work and using it to drive instruction and target individual student needs.    Teams work closely to review performance tasks and classroom level assessments to norm around the quality and  rigor of tasks, as well as scoring norms and the use/analysis of data outcomes.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X505, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The Bronx School for Law, Government & Justice will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)    School-Parent Compact (SPC)   09X505, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

We strongly believe that reading and writing  skills are imperative for academic success. Our program is designed to use an appropriate skill- based curriculum that will allow our ELLs to develop their language skills in a variety of  academic contents. Our focus on reading will include a variety of non-fiction texts that will  provide an opportunity for students to build their skills. This includes acquiring the use of  academic vocabulary, annotation, close readings, identifying important concepts and events, and  building background knowledge. Our writing component will develop our ELLs’ skills in non- fiction pre-writing activities, paragraph development, and the revision process. The purpose of  this work is to support students and help them demonstrate improvement in their content  classes.  Our belief is that supporting literacy skills for our ENL students will increase their  classroom engagement and result in increased pass rates for ENL students across content  areas.One supplemental program will take place on Saturdays during the 2018-2019 school year.  These classes will focus on two groups of ENLs Entering/Emerging, and  Transtioning/Expanding ELL students in grades 6-12. Students will be grouped based on their  designated NYSESLAT score, or if they are a new student, the NYISTELL. In reviewing these  pieces of student information, students will be assigned courses designed to help them prepare  for required Regents Exams (HS students) and MS State Exams (6-8).  Saturday High School (9-12) Program for Regents for ENL students will meet for a total of  24  Saturday sessions from November 10th- May 25th.  The program will run from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00  p.m. This program will be taught by Ms. Elkind, a certified ENL teacher.  Saturday Middle School (6-8) Program will run from November 10th through May 25th from  9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. for a total of 24 sessions. This program will be taught by Ms. Canser, a  certified ENL teacher.  Additionally, we will offer afterschool classes targeted to High School students occuring twice  weekly from 3:15 - 4:45 p.m.  This program will target students in grades 9-12 and will provide  tutoring in the areas of Math and Science.  This program will begin on November 13, 2018 and  extend until May 31, 2019 and will include a total of 40 sessions taught by Mr. Adames, certified  7-12 Math and Ms. Lopez, certified Science 7-12.  Lesson plans and curriculum are being  developed through a partnership with Gear Up and are specific to supporting needs of ENL  students. Students will be identified based on their NYSESLAT scores and their baseline  assessments in Math and Science. Transitioning/Expanding ENL students will be given  priority.  The rationale for this decision is that Math and Science Regents scores have dropped  for our High School ENL students and building additional academic language in English will  support the improvement in these content areas. This program will run Mon/Weds or Tues/Thurs  based on teacher/student availability.  We will also offer a Middle School supplemental program that will take place after school from  3:15 - 4:45 p.m.  This program will target students in grades 7-8 and will provide ENL services   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   though one to one homework support, Rosetta Stone language development curriculum, and skill  building support.  This program begins on November 13, 2018 and extends until May 31, 2019  for a total of 40 sessions. This course will be taught by Ms. Canser, a certfied ENL  teacher.   Students will be identified based on their NYSESLAT scores and their baseline  assessments in core content areas. Entering and Emerging ELLs will be given priority. The  rationale for this decision is that our ENL student population has recently changed and we have  welcome a larger number of Entering/Emerging students who require additional and more  intensive language supports in order to be successful on NYS Common Core Exams.   Building  additional academic language in English will support the improvement in all content areas. This  program will run Mon/Weds or Tues/Thurs based on teacher/student availability.  The instruction in all programs  will be 100% in English. Attendance will be taken during each  session and outreach to parents will be made to ensure regular attendance (using translation  services and/or bilingual staff).  All courses will maintain a maximum 15:1 student teacher ratio  and each course will have it's own classroom.  In order to fully fund these afterschool and  Saturday programs, additional Title I per session funds will be allocated for the remaining costs.

This includes a foundation of understanding the theories of second language acquisition,  the best practices for teaching ELLs, and analyzing and reflecting on our ELL data from state  and local assessments.   It is our belief that this professional development program  will increase  student engagement fo ENL students in their classes resulting in increased pass rates and daily  attendance.  All teachers, grades 6-12, will participate in differentiated professional development cycles  targeted at the teacher's current levels of performance as measured by classroom walkthroughs  and observations.  Based on placement data for teachers, the professional development plan  provided at 09x505  will take place the following dates, times and on the following topics:  1.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?         As we are a 6-12 school, all students participate in the DRP Core Comprehension Test to measure each student's ability to  read and understand increasingly complex texts.  Data from this assessment provide teachers with the most difficult texts a  student can understand with 90 percent or higher comprehension.  The assessment also indicates which students are reading  at, above or below grade level and within what grade band they are currently reading so that teachers can provide level  appropriate texts, supports and intervention strategies.   Additionally, this year all students grade 6-12 are being assessed  using teacher created readiness exams aligned to state tests in ELA, Math, SS and Science.        In September, ELL students take teacher made assessments that provide baseline data for reading, writing, speaking and  listening skills.  Periodic Assessments are given three times per year to monitor ELL student progress on each strand.           Daily formative and regular summative assessments are used to track student progress relative to learning  objectives.    Teachers analyze data to gain a deep understanding of student content and skill levels and create instructional  next steps based on what the data tells them.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Data provides insights on reading levels, reading comprehension, writing skills, grammar, syntax, sentence and paragraph  construction as well as listening and speaking skills.  Instructional next steps are based on data analysis of where students are  relative to where they need to be.  Instructional next steps will address all student ability levels and will inform text selection,  appropriate scaffolds, student groupings and selected strategies.                   2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Common planning time occurs 3 times per week with the two certified  ENL teachers along with the Instructional AP and/or  the Principal. Stand alone ENL students participate in three Readiness exams (Fall, Winter, Spring) which assess performance  on NYSESLAT aligned content/standards.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELLs primarily by reviewing our Graduation cohort data. We review the Regents Completion  data for ELLs, as well as four and six year weighted graduation rates.  In our last State Report card, we met were not given AYP  scores based on having less than 5 students participating in the assessments as our overall ELL student population is  low.  However, in house tracking of Regents outcomes and in the report they did provide, we are fully aware that our ELL  students are not performing on the NYS Regents Exams at the same levels as our overall student population.  Our strategies to  combat this have included adding an ENL Saturday Academy, after school supports and the hiring of a new ENL teacher this  school year.   Rosetta Stone online curriculum is used to support both the Saturday and afterschool programs.  While we have too few a target population to be scored for state AYP for ELLs, our 2017-2018 NYC school quality guide showed  that ELL yr graduation rate dropped 17% to 67%.  We did,however, increase the average MS ELA proficiency rating to 2.61 up  from 2.51 in 16-17.  Math however remained stagnant with 2.29 average proficiency for ELLs in 17-18 compared to 2.31 in 16- 17.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered, a departmental data dive is completed during common planning time with the ENL  teachers, Instructional AP, Instructional coach and/or the Principal to determine appropriate interventions, to assign students  to groupings and to monitor student growth from the previous assessments.  As needed, interventions are created/revised  based on student outcomes.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable because we do not serve grades K - 5.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The patterns in students' results in the four modalities across the proficiency levels and grades are as follows: the students are  scoring higher in listening, speaking and reading than in writing on the NYSESLAT. The students are developing their  competence in Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) at a rapid pace. Using the city and state assessment data, it  indicates that their Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP)  is not yet at par. Based on the NYSESLAT data, writing is  the modality in need of the most improvement.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Data analyzed is disseminated to grade teams during their bi-monthly meetings.  At that time, ENL teachers are able to share  with core classroom instructors the data outcomes of their students and provide supports for language  acquisition.  Additionally, at the beginning of each semester, the ENL teachers and the program chair meet to review student  placements in ENL courses and service delivery options.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   LGJ has a free standing ENL program for students in grades nine through twelve through a self contained ungraded  heterogenously grouped program where English is the language of instruction.   LGJ has a push-in ENL program for  students in grades six through eight.  These middle schoolers are also grouped heterogoenously where English is the  language of instruction; however, they are separated by grade.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               In the middle school grades 6-8, ELL students at each grade level are split into two groups by performance levels and  distributed into two integrated homerooms to receive targeted small group instruction in their integrated classrooms and to  ensure the appropriate number of minutes are received at each performance level as outline below.          Due to low enrollment in HS for our ELL population,  we offer one free standing ENL course.  All of our high school  students  enrolled in this course are Emerging or below.  They are also integrated heterogenously into their mainstream  general courses.  Based on levels of performance additional service minutes are offered as outlined below.        The number of ELL instructional units that students receive is allocated as per New York State CR Part-154 regulation  and determined by students' proficiency levels as indicated by their Spanish LAB, NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores and instructed  be a certified ENL pedagogue, either Sapphire Canser or Christopher Munsey. Students who are currently at an Entering or  Emerging level are offered the following supports: Free Standing or push-in ELL with a licensed ELL teacher; 540 minutes of ELA  instruction, IEP mandated Speech Therapy by a bilingual Speech Therapist and Related services (where indicated on a student's  IEP). Students who are currently at the Transitioning or Expanding level are offered the following supports:  push-in supports  for 240 minutes per week; after-school Academic Intervention Services two to four periods per week.  Students who are  currently at the Commanding level are offered the following supports: push-in supports for 240 minutes per week; afterschool  Academic Intervention Services two to four periods per week.  In addtion, all ELL students are in ELA class one period each day  (6th-8th Grade has eight periods per week total), five times per week. Commanding and Expanding students are programmed  to receive 240 minutes of ENL instruction plus 240 minutes of mainstream English, Emerging and transitioning students receive  240 minutes of ENL each week.           For Saturday Academy and after school interventions, ELLs are grouped according to ability levels based on NYSESLAT  results in homogenous classes. Within each class students are put into sub groups for targeted small group instruction.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      ELLs of all levels are in mainstream content area classes, which are taught in English with home language supports as  needed.  This means that students receive modified text and assignments, students work individually or are paired or grouped  heterogeneously or homogeneously within the class depending upon the assignment.  ELL students are in Mathematics, Social  Studies, English and Science classes one period each day, totaling 250 minutes per week per content area.  Content area  teachers are trained in teaching strategies that work for ELL students such as: scaffolding, pre-teaching vocabulary and visuals   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      and gestures. Content area teachers are expected to differentiate their lessons with tiered activities that allow students of all  ability levels to learn the same essential concepts in different ways; and use adaptive technologies that modify the format of  curriculum and/or assessment. In addition, the Assistant Principal will conduct joint formal observations in the content-area  and teachers will receive recommendations and staff development to improve instruction for ELL students.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We ensure that ELLS are appropriately evaluated in their native language by first identifying their native language through  the Home Language Survey which is administered during the initial interview process.   If a student is entitled to be tested in  his or her native language we will work with teachers to have classroom exams and student answers accurately translated.  We  will also make sure state testing materials are ordered in students' native languages if the student is entitled to the same.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  For SIFE students,  in addition to regular classroom instruction, we offer after school tutoring, Academic Intervention  courses in ELA and Math for 8th grade students and ELA Regents preparation two times per week  for high school students.  When possible, tutoring is conducted with an ESL certified teacher and a native language teacher. In addition, students are  prepared for ELA testing during their ESL class. Professional development support is provided to content area teachers of ELLs.  A Saturday ENL Academy also takes place for SIFE students to prepare them for the CCLS Exams & the NYSESLAT exams.  Rosetta Stone curriculum is implemented during the afterschool/saturday programs for SIFE students to enhance English  language acquisition.   b.  For newcomers, in addition to regular classroom instruction, we offer after school tutoring, Academic Intervention courses  in ELA and Math for 8th grade students and ELA Regents preparation two times per week  for high school students. When  possible, tutoring is conducted with an ESL certified teacher and a native language teacher. In addition, students are prepared  for ELA testing during their ESL class. Professional development support is provided to content area teachers of ELLs. A  Saturday ELL Academy also takes place for newcomers to prepare them for the CCLS Exams in ELA & the  NYSESLAT exams. Rosetta Stone curriculum is implemented during the afterschool/saturday programs for newcomer students  to enhance English language acquisition.  c. For ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years, our goal is for them to not only attain proficiency on the NYSESLAT, but to be  prepared for the rigors of college coursework. Afterschool homework help and tutoring is available to all ELL students, as well  as Saturday Academy courses for test prep. Regents prep is also available for high school students and ELA/Math Test Prep for  MS Students.   d. For Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years), we offer peer tutoring and a Saturday ESL Academy where we focus on intensive  NYSESLAT preparation and ELA Regents preparation. Teachers and guidance counselors maintain communication with the  parents to discuss the program and student progress.   e.  Former ELLs in years 1 & 2 after testing proficient are extended the same peer tutoring offerings, as well as entrance into  Saturday Academy, as current ELLs.  Additionally, student performance on the NYC Performance Assessment, as well as the  Regents and/or CCLS Math/ELA exam is monitored for all former ELLs in year 1 or 2 after testing proficient to ensure they are  continuing to thrive in a mainstream environment.  Parent communication and enrollment in after school tutoring, homework  help or test prep is recommended at the conclusion of each marking period for those students not showing adequate progress  on periodic assessments.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are identified as having special needs are provided with any and all accommodations as per their  Individualized Education Plan (paraprofessionals, testing accommodations etc.) Push-in ELL services are recommended, if  possible, to reduce the time out of the general education classroom dependent on the Related Services, Special Education  classes indicated on the IEP.  Teachers identify long-term learning objectives that are broken into appropriate learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      segments which are within the ZPD for ELLs who have disabilities. Learning objectives are written in clear language, pacing is  adjusted accordingly,  the number of items a learner completes is modified, teachers select and modify text according to  reading abiliites with vocabulary supports to improve English acquisition.  Repetition is frequent, methodologies are consistent  and regular, assessment is used to determine where students are relative to the learning objectives.  Assessment data dives  instructional next step and  meaningful feedback is provided.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   ELLs who are identified as having special needs are provided with any and all accommodations as per their  Individualized Education Plan (paraprofessionals, testing accommodations etc.) Push-in ESL services are recommended, if  possible, to reduce the time out of the general education classroom dependent on the Related Services, Special Education  classes indicated on the IEP.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer an after school tutoring program for ENL students. At this after school program content area teachers tutor ELLs in all  subject areas. Content area teachers will provide meaningful lessons that strengthen background information and promote the  literacy of students. As previously described above, we also offer a Saturday School Academy to all ELL students for the  purposes of test preparation for NYSESLAT, ELA Regents and MS ELA Exams.  Students receive modified text and assignments, students work individually or are paired or grouped heterogeneously or  homogeneously within the class depending upon the assignement.  Newcomer and developing ELLs can be paired or grouped  with expanding or commanding home language speakers.  Periodic Assessments may be offered in home language if needed.  Intervention services are offered in Spanish.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, we will continue the implementation of our Saturday School Academy for ELL students and our  after school tutoring program.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs or services for ELLs will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs both academic and extracurriculuar. In addition, they participate in  afterschool clubs and sports programs.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used in the ELL program support the development of language acquisition across the content areas.  The primary textbooks support the New York State standards for English as a Second Language in grades 6-12. Supplementary  textbooks and the use of dictionaries and picture dictionaries, glossaries, thesaurus and content area books are also provided.  Rosetta Stone online curriculum is used during both the Saturday and afterschool interventions. Some ENL students are also  enrolled in the Read 180 intervention program.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided in the ELL classroom. This is done by clarifying directions in students' L1 when  possible.  Students are provided instruction to develop vocabulary and literacy in the form of reading comprehension,  grammar and essay construction.   Native language texts are provided when available and appropriate to the student's  proficiency level.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ELL curriculum is differentiated to support students' needs by age and grade level. The textbooks utilized are age  appropriate and reflect lexile level. In Middle School, push-in ELL classes are grade specific to reinforce common core aligned  themes as applicable to second language acquisition. Students are programmed according to ability level based on NYSESLAT  as well as their grade level where possible.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Not applicable, we have our own building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs have the opportunity to attend the summer bridge program where students become familiar with the  teachers, classrooms and staff in our building. A tour of the building is also offered at parent orientation or during the first  week of student enrollment by the bilingual school counselor, Cynthia Glass. We communicate all school rules, regulations and  policies with parents/students in the student's native language, communications are curated and sent for translation by the  Parent Coordinator, Gail Smallwood. A list of ELL students is sent to teachers at the beginning of the school year by the  Organizational AP Max O'Casey so that they may identify a student immediately for modifications and supports as applicable.    A monthly breakfast is hosted by the Principal for newcomer ENL students to welcome any recent admits as well as check in  with existing newcomers and their acclimation to the school, community and language.  Social workers and counselors are  included in these breakfasts to provide additional insight/supports. The breakfast also allows students an opportunity to  demonstrate their  language skills in English.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives offered to ELLs include Spanish.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers and assistant principals will be provided with ongoing staff development, research based strategies to improve  teaching and learning for ELLs. Professional Development session occur weekly on Wednesdays as well three full professional  days throughout the year.  Assistant principals attend an in-house training as well as outside conferences to satisfy the  mandated hours of ELL training. The assistant principal of foreign language maintains a record of satisfication of mandated  hours. Content area teachers will be trained on systematically teaching discipline-specific language (routines, questioning, and  techniques to check for understanding). All teachers and assistant principals will be trained in second language acquisition and  ESL teaching methodology. All teachers are encouraged to attend QTEL (Quality Teaching for English Language Learners)  workshop. Assistant principals from all content areas will attend conferences on differentiating instruction for ELLs. They will  be trained on the use of materials and ELL methodology in the content areas as well as interpreting data that impacts   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         programming and teaching strategies. Additionally, this year the ELA teachers will engage in an inquiry study around  differentiating instruction for ELL learners     Ninth grade teachers are provided with ongoing staff development on research based strategies to assist ELLs as they  transition from middle school to high school. For example, teachers are trained on how to give instructions with clear  expectations, provide sentence starters to help the students articulate, notetaking skills, and other strategies. The school  support team also identifies ELL students who present as at-risk in the ninth grade based on scholarship, attendance and  testing outcomes. Interventions are put into place to address student concerns in the first semester of the ninth grade year.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development is provided to all staff in providing adequate scaffolds and entry points for ELLs in each subject area  as they move from one grade to the next.  Additionally, our ENL teachers who service all our ELL students in grades 6-12 meets  with grade teams during professional development time to support teachers in providing transition support as ELL students  move from middle to high school. Our bilingual counselor, Cynthia Glass,  is also a certified foreign language pedagogue who  has extensive training in second language acquisition.     All teachers servicing ELLs participate in staff development related to the education and assessment of ELLs, for a minimum of  15% of their total required hours.  Opportunities for such PD are provided during the full day in house PD Days, Lunch and  Learns provided by our ENL teacher leaders and instructional coaches.  Assistant principals will attend an in-house training as  well as outside conferences to satisfy the mandated hours. Some of the topics covered during the training to complete  mandated hours include: Identifying ELL students -Personal –Background information, Data- ATS, A Guide to Teaching ELL  Students ; Programs in New York State for ELL Students, Regents Statistics in the School for ELLs- and Lesson planning –  Differentiation of Instruction for ELLs. Meeting Agendas and attendance sign in sheets are maintained for all professional  development activities.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teachers, in collaboration with the bilingual school counselor meet annually with the parents of ELL students to  discuss the goals of the program, as well as their individual child's progress towards language proficiency and development.  When necessary, the ENL teacher, Sapphire Canser and Christopher Munsey, will reach out for translations services in order to  accommodate parents with home languages other than Spanish.   The most recent NYSESLAT or other assessment data is  reviewed, as well as the student's most current progress report/report card.   The Parent Coordinator is often utilized to  organize and schedule these meetings using the bilingual school secretary or translation services for oral and written  communication when doing parent outreach.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  LGJ’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including  parents/guardians of English Language Learners. Parental involvement at LGJ is supported by the initiatives outlined below:  Jupitergrades – (An online, real time grade book of student progress) To encourage parent involvement and to support the  academic success of all students, parents are given online access to Jupitergrades.com. This program is web based, user  friendly and provides academic information in both English and Spanish. JupiterGrades.com enables both parents and students  to check student grades, attendance and homework online from any computer.           To support these initiatives, we will continue to conduct parent workshops and training sessions in both Spanish and      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         English to support parent use of these programs.  We have a designated computer located in the parent coordinator's suite for  parent use. We feel strongly that this will empower parents to be an integral part of their children’s educational success.          It is our goal to always make parents feel welcome at our school. To support this goal, we have created a Parent Room  where parents meet with Teachers Guidance Counselors, Risk Counselors, and Social Workers for private conferences which  are conducted in both Spanish and English as needed. In order to ensure that parents receive relevant and timely information  about our school and about their children, we use many forms of communication. The following systems and practices are  utilized when disseminating information about our school:         •School Messenger Phone System – Phone messages regarding student attendance, lateness, after school events  and parent-teacher conferences are programmed through our School Messenger Phone System. Through this system we are  able to call, text and email parents with important information in a timely manner. In addition, we send out all messages in  both Spanish and English in order to better serve our student population.         •Jupitergrades Emails – Administrators, Teachers, Social Workers and School Counselors can email parents and  students  through our Jupitergrades system. This is especially useful when communicating academic progress and attendance.  This can  be accessed in both Spanish and English        •Consistent and Regular Mailings – As an additional measure of communication, we will often have school wide mailings (in  addition to phone calls home and emails) to keep parents informed of ongoing school events. These mailings are provided in  both Spanish and English.        •LGJ Parent Association Survey – We are providing all parents with a survey to determine how they would like to be  more  involved at our school. We hope to gain feedback from parents regarding what they want to see in our school as well as  what they are interested in participating in. In doing so, it is our goal to increase parent communication and parent  involvement within our school community. This too is provided in both Spanish and English        •Grade specific parent meetings are conducted yearly and we provide a Spanish language translation room for all parents  whose native language is Spanish.         •The Parent Coordinator utilizes the bilingual school secretary or translation services for oral and written communication  when doing parent outreach, translating documents and facilitating meetings.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Johanie Hernandez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bx School for Law, Gov't & Jus                                                                              School DBN: 09X505  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
