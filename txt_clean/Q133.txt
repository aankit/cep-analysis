This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S. 133 is to provide all students with a high quality education that enables and encourages lifelong  learning and empowers children to become self-sufficient individuals possessing positive self-esteem, respect for  themselves and their community. We seek to create an environment that achieves equity for all students and ensures  that each student is a successful learner, is fully respected, and learns to respect others. We create a safe and secure  school environment that promotes social and academic growth and develops an enthusiasm for learning, a positive  self-image and cross-cultural understanding. Through the joint efforts of the entire P.S. 133 school community,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      children will develop their individual talents, values and critical thinking skills enabling them to become contributing  members of their community and society.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 133 is located in the Bellerose area of Queens. Our school serves approximately 580 students, in Grades  Pre -kindergarten through 5, consisting of General education, Collaborative Team Teaching, Self-contained and Gifted  and Talented classes.    According to the 2017-2018 Teachers College Benchmark data, 14% of our students population are reading  significantly below grade level (Level 1) and 17% of our students are approaching grade level (Level 2). 31% of our  students are struggling to read and comprehend book and passages on their grade level. For the 2018-2019 school  year, we have partnered with Columbia Teachers College to ensure the success of all our students in the area of  English Language Arts. As a Teachers College Reading and Writing Program project school, we have targeted in house  professional learning where teachers get to engage in hands on learning that allows them to plan lessons designed to  meet ambitious 21st century standards. This year we will also adopt Reading Rescue as an intervention program to  help our students close the achievement gap. Reading Rescue is a daily, one-on-one, 30 minute literacy intervention  for elementary students, and a professional development program for school staff members. Students in first and  second and any other students reading below a Level M will receive additional support in reading, writing, and  speaking from a trained Reading Rescue Instructor. Our staff will go through a two-year professional development  sequence preparing them to provide skilled intervention that teaches below-grade level students how to read and  write.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Here at P.S. 133Q we believe in an Inclusive school community where all students are pushed to meet and exceed  grade level. We offer Self-Contained Services, Integrated Co-Teaching Services. Special Eucation Teacher Support  Services as well as Gifted and Talented services.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the 2017-2018 school year, the element of the Framework for Great Schools in which P.S. 133Q made the most  progress was Collaborative Teachers. Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms  and schools. Teachers engage in daily common planning time with grade level colleagues. The Instructional Leadership  Team (ILT) has worked collaboratively with administration to plan meaningful and effective professional learning  opportunities for the staff. All teachers and paraprofessionals have had the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      As we continue to grow our pedagogical knowledge and leadership capacities, we will take a deeper look into ways  we as educators can foster more discourse with our classrooms. Our instructional focus for the 2018-19 school year is  "If students are provided with open ended questions across content areas and given the time to work collaboratively  then they will strengthen their ability to engage in authentic discourse and provide peers with meaningful and  effective feedback."          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q133   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   553   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Our teachers have  the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.  According to the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide, 100% of the teachers say that they talk with one another about  instruction and that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and coherent.  Teachers are given enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas that will raise the level of rigor in  their classroom. As a school we whole heartily believe that "If students are provided with open ended questions  across content areas and given the time to work collaboratively then they will strengthen their ability to engage in  authentic discourse and provide peers with meaningful and effective feedback."    ● Through an analysis of teacher observations it has been noted that instruction has been slowly shifting from a more  traditional learning experience to a more inquiry based experience where teacher are crafting purposeful open-ended  questions and allowing students opportunities throughout the day to engage with peers. However, this area still  remains a priority for P.S. 133.   ● Looking at data provided by the ADVANCE Rating System it has been determined that the priority need to focus on  for the 2018-2019 school year will be focused around questioning and discussion. According to the data in Domain 3,  specifically, : 3B - Questioning and Discussions, the overall average for teacher rating was 2.70 out of 4. This is a 0.2  above the average rating for Developing.    ● Looking at data provided from the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide it has been determined that as a school there  should be an emphasis on the quality of student discussion as in this area P.S. 133 scored a 66% out of a 100%. 68% of  teachers stated that students build on each others ideas during class discussion, 57% of teachers stated that students  use data or text references to support their ideas, 46% of teachers say that students provide constructive feedback to  their peers and teachers and 79% of teachers say that students participate in class discussions at some point.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 133Q], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 133, Q. will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

A  supervisor will be needed and must be present in the building as there is no other program  operating during the hours of the Title III Program.  Identified students in grades K-5 who have  scored at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels on the  NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and/or have been in the United States for less than two years will be  eligible to participate in the Saturday Academy.  Former ELLs who tested out will also be  invited to the Title III program activities.  The program will consist of six Saturday sessions  (March 9th, March 16th , March 23rd, March 30th, April 6th, and April 13th.) of three hours  (9:00am to 12:00pm) of additional targeted instruction.  Students will be divided into subgroups  determined by their level on the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT, TC Independent Reading  Level, and their grade level.  The school will maintain copies and signed tear-offs of the parent  notifications that were sent home in parents' preferred languages (or with a multilingual stamp to  translate this notice.)  Attendance will be taken on a class list paper and kept on record of  students who attended each class.  All records will be maintained in the Title III 2018-2019  Folder located in the Supervisor's office.  Instruction will be provided to support, supplement and  enrich the core curriculum that is part of the regular school day.  The proposed program will  include instruction in ELA, Math and content area subjects.  Instruction will be provided by a  certified ENL teacher and five other NYC licensed common branch teachers who will provide  extra support in ELA, Math and the content area subjects.  Preference will be given to any  teacher that possesses an ESL license or certification.  The ENL teacher and the five common  branch teachers will collaborate lesson plans and co teach during the push in period.  In addition,  teachers will meet in study groups with the ENL teacher for 30 minutes weekly to review  appropriate strategies and techniques that are proven successful for improving learning for ELLs  and to read and discuss professional articles.  There will be five classes divided by grade level,  by students' proficiency level and ability.  The ENL teacher will push in and co teach with each  class for 30 minutes.  Our school has a multi-ethnic population.  The languages represented by  the community include Spanish, Punjabi, Urdu, Hindi, Gujarati, and Chinese.  Instruction will be  in English with native language support whenever possible.  For students who have been in the United States less than two years and/or have scored at the  Entering or Emerging levels on the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT, intensive language proficiency  language instruction will be provided through the Language Proficiency Intervention  Kits.  While many students have social fluency in English, their literacy and academic fluency  needs reinforcement.  The kits supplement both literacy and science content instruction and  reinforces all four modalities found on ENL and ELA assessments: listening, reading, writing,  and speaking.  The kits provide for differentiated small group instruction.  The components  support read alouds, guided reading, guided writing, and partner reading.  GoMath! provides  specific support for teachers to meet the needs of the ELL child.  Each lesson has a brief lesson  summary, vocabulary list and an example or illustration to provide the ELL student with an  overview.  To support language development for English Language Learners support is  embedded in the lessons as well as being available as separate activities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Materials will be purchased and will be supplemental and distinct from those used in daily  instruction.  The Buckle Down to the Common Core Standards Series for ELA and Math will be  utilized to help prepare and support ELLs and Former ELLs for State Assessments.  Supporting  and scaffolding skills needed to succeed in ELA, Math and content areas will benefit ELLs and  Former ELLs while moving them toward meeting Common Core Standards.  Our intent is to  purchase components of this program for grades 3-5.  The Title III funds for 2018-2019 will  enable us to purchase materials as needed for selected grades.  Additional materials will be  ordered through alternate funding sources.  The goals of our Title III program are as follows:  *Provide high quality literacy, math and content area instruction through ENL strategies and  techniques  *Support our ELL students in meeting standards on all State Assessments  *Utilize data (i.e. NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, State Assessments, TCRWP Assessment Pro,  Teacher's College Independent Reading Levels) to inform instruction.  *Utilize technology on an increased basis to support student learning such as use of  the interactive boards, computers, and iPads during classes.   Growth and success will be measured by increasing reading level on the TC Independent  Reading Level and showing improvement on the proficiency level on the NYSESLAT.  Students  will also show improvement on the NYS ELA and NYS Math Assessments.

This will involve a  thorough review and analysis of data and student work including writing samples, classroom  assessments and item analysis of formal assessments, TCRWP Assessment Pro, Teacher's  College Independent Reading Levels, State Assessments in ELA, Math, and Science,  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Teachers will participate in study groups reviewing articles and  videos about supporting ELLs which will include, but are not limited to topics such as, The RtI  Guide for Teachers of ELLs, The Blueprint for English Language learners Success, Mathematics  Problem-Solving Strategies foe ELLs, Text Complexity and English Language Learners-  Building vocabulary, etc.  these Professional Development sessions will take place on Saturdays  8:30-9:00am before each class begins.  Through these rich, collaborative discussions and  analysis of data, teachers will positively impact the progress of their ELLs.  Agendas and  attendance sheets for these PD Sessions will be maintained for our records in the Title III 2018- 2019 Folder located in the Supervisor's office.  These PD topics will also be incorporated into  school staff PD sessions throughout the school year.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

To further involve and communicate effectively with parents of ELLs, PS 133 makes  sure that all parents are aware of the free adult ESL classes offered at local schools for family  and friends of the community to improve their English skills.  Those adult ESL classes are  offered from September to June on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:00am to 2:00pm.  The  classes that we direct our parents to are part of the NYCDOE initiative.  Parents' needs are discussed at monthly meetings including PTA, Tea and Talk, and School  Leadership Team.  As part of the Title III Program there will be at least two one- hour Parent  Workshops for parents given by the ENL teacher and a common branch teacher to review  Common Core Standards in ELA and Math, understanding what is expected of their children on  NYS assessments, and what they can do to help their child.  All parents of ELLs and F-ELLs will  be encouraged to attend these workshops.  Agendas and Attendance Sign-In Sheets will be kept  in the Title III 2018-2019 Folder located in the Supervisor's office.    We often arrange, when  possible, to have a paraprofessional who speaks Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Hindi or Spanish to be  available for parent conferences of telephone conferences during the year.  Translation  interpretation services are also used when needed.  Communication to parents includes school  notices, monthly news letters and a comprehensive school website.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 133 uses the TCRWP as the early literacy assessment tool to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  This comprehensive  assessment provides data related to a variety of skills including: Letter Identification Assessment; Word Identification  Assessment; Concepts About Print Assessment; Spelling Assessment; and a Text Reading Assessment which determines a  student’s Independent Reading Level in grades K-2 or Independent Reading Levels Pre-Emergent through K.  TCRWP is also  used in grades 3-5 or levels L-Z to assess a students' Independent Reading level. It is a tool to provide data on the students'  ability to retell, answer literal and inferential questions.  In addition it provides insight to students' oral fluency, reading rate,  and word recognition.  The data provides the teacher with the students' Independent Reading Level as well as Guided and  Instructional Reading levels.   This data will help teachers differentiate their instruction, form reading groups and target skills  needed to improve the early literacy skills of their ELLs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Running records and students' Independent Reading Levels are shared with the ENL teacher and support staff each time the  student is assessed or moves to a new level.  Sharing Independent Reading Levels as well as the areas of strengths and  weaknesses helps target instruction for that student.  The ENL teacher attends weekly Common Planning time to share  strategies with teachers and to assist teachers when thinking about Unit/ Lesson Plan modifications.  The ENL teacher also  runs professional learning session for teachers on an ongoing basis.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs, PS 133 uses a variety of measures.  Scores on the NYSESLAT, as well as any  informal tests that ELLs take will be used to measure students' progress.  Progress monitoring for any RtI interventions will be  used to make decisions about student goals, instruction and services.  PS 133 will also use the EDAT tool to help measure  students' progress, guide instruction and evaluate the ENL Program.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL teacher, classroom teachers, and support staff will meet during Common Preps or Tuesday's OPW time to share data  and discuss students' areas of need, progress, and goals.The ENL teacher is also given Congruence time to conference with  each classroom teacher about their students to discuss progress and next steps.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 133 uses data from formal and informal assessments to guide instruction for ELLs.  The RtI framework for grades K-5 offers  three Tiers of intervention to support students.  Tier 1 provides a strong instructional core that is intended to incorporate high  quality instruction for all students in the classroom.  Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more  targeted and intensive academic support.  This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings with  instruction focused on specific learning targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction should also be tailored to meet ELLs’ language  needs and should be incorporated into research-based intervention strategies.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are as follows: The students who took the NYSITELL  in Kindergarten have the following performance levels: 2 Entering, 3 Emerging, 2 Transitioning, and 5 Expanding. In grades 1-5,  the pattern revealed is that students with a performance level of Entering or Emerging are our newcomers and students with  disabilities. In addition, NYSESLAT data reveals that our students exhibit a pattern of advancing at least one level, from one  year to the next.   In order to design effective instruction and/or intervention we collect and analyze information from the EDAT using such  factors as home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/Math performance, NYSESLAT proficiency and progress,  attendance, age, holdover status, SIFE status and disability classification. The early warning indicator feature automatically  calculates the number of risk factors exhibited and color codes them accordingly. The data reveals that most of our students  meet their annual goals.  Data from the 2017 ELA and State Math tests were also analyzed.  There were 9 ELL students in testing grades 3 to 5.   Out of  the 9 students, 5 were first-year Newcomers and therefore exempt from the ELA. Out of the four ELL students that did  participate in the State ELA, two Newcomer ELL students scored a Level 2 and two Students With Disabilities scored a Level  1.  Out of the 9 students, 3 ELL students scored at a Level 3 or 4, showing that they met or exceeded grade level standards in  Math.  Two students scored a level 2, one of which was a Newcomer and one was a SWD.  The one ELL who scored a Level 1 on  the State Math was a true Newcomer who had just come to our school a few weeks before the test.  Three ELL students did  not participate in the Math test due to a Parent Refusal Letter.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The findings from outcome assessments and data will be shared with staff during the LAP meetings, common  preps,  Congruence, or Tuesday's OPW time.  ELL students' statistics are also shared during Professional Learning with the ENL  teacher to make the staff aware of the ELL population in our school and their needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The current ELL instructional program at P.S. 133 is freestanding English as a New Language pull-out model instructed  by a one full-time New York State and New York City certified ENL teacher that services heterogeneous groups of  students from Kindergarten through Grade 5.  This ENL program enables students in Kindergarten through Grade 5 to  receive mandated instruction and enrichment in reading, writing, listening and oral language.  After selection,  students from various classes are grouped together by their proficiency level and by grade (no more than two  contiguous grades are grouped together.)  Stand-alone instruction is given to Entering and Emerging students with a  focus on foundational skills as well as emergent literacy skills.  Integrated ENL instruction is given to students at all  proficiency levels and is a pull-out ENL program with a focus on language acquisition through content area instruction.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and Emerging level students receive 1 unit (4 periods, 180 minutes) of Stand-alone ENL services in a pull-out model  with a certified ESOL teacher.  They also receive 1 unit (4 periods, 180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA services in a push-in  model with a certified ESOL teacher and a certified Common Branch teacher co-teaching.  Transitioning level students receive  half of a unit (2 periods, 90 minutes) of Stand-alone ENL services in a pull-out model with a certified ESOL teacher and half of a  unit (2 periods, 90 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA services in a push-in model with a certified ESOL teacher and a Common  Branch teacher co-teaching.  When scheduling allows a Transitioning level student may receive the whole 1 unit (4 periods,  180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA services in a push-in model with a certified ESOL teacher and a certified Common Branch  teacher co-teaching.  Expanding level students receive 1 unit (4 periods, 180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA/ or other content  area services in a push-in model with a certified ESOL teacher and a certified Common Branch teacher co- teaching.  Commanding level students receive half of a unit (2 periods, 180 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ELA or other content  area in a push-in model with a Certified ESOL teacher and a Certified Common Branch teacher co-teaching.             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   P.S. 133 will implement The Practitioners’ Work Group for Accelerating English Language Learner Student Achievement Nine  Common Features of Successful Programs for ELLs.  To assure that Limited English Proficient students achieve the highest  academic standards, the focus will be on improving Literacy and Math.  Differentiated curriculum and ENL instructional  strategies will be used in accordance with the Principles of Learning, the Common Core Learning Standards, and the Learning  Standards for English as a Second Language.  ENL classes will support academic development in content areas.  Content area   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      instruction will be taught using Scaffolding Strategies.  Six main types of scaffolding techniques include: modeling, bridging,  contextualization, schema building, text re-presentation, and metacognition.  Instruction in the ENL program is in English to  promote second language acquisition. The instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to  enrich language development are hands-on activities, modeling, role playing, storytelling, music, repetition, visual aids, Total  Physical Response and Choral speaking.  The ENL teacher uses the National Geographic Reach Program specifically written for  ELLs to teach language through literature that is Science or Social Studies content based.  The ELL students in P.S. 133 spend  the entire day in an all-English content area instructional classroom. All ELLs participate in the Teacher's College Reading and  Writing Program and the GO Math! Program (a focused program designed to meet the objectives and intent of the Common  Core State Standards for Mathematics.)        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Spanish speaking students that are identified as ELLs are tested in their native language. They are administered the Spanish  LAB, if they didn't reach a proficiency level on the English NYSITELL, to measure their fluency in their native language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At present, P.S. 133 does not have any SIFE students.  If a SIFE student were enrolled in the future, that student would be  placed in the appropriate ENL group based on his/her proficiency level and grade level.  All identified, newcomer ELLs are given  the NYSITELL within the first ten days of enrollment and are then placed in the appropriate ENL group based on their grade  and proficiency level.  Currently, P.S. 133 does not have any long-term ELLs in the ENL Program.  If a long-term ELL student  were enrolled in the future, teachers would review Interim Assessment scores and State test scores to better understand the  needs of the student and drive instruction.  The student would then receive differentiated instruction to help the student meet  Common Core Standards.  P.S. 133 offers continuing transitional support for all ELLs reaching proficiency on the  NYSESLAT.  After testing at the Commanding level on the NYSESLAT, students will receive .5 unit of Integrated ENL in ELA or  Content Area for an additional two years.  For additional transitional support, these students are also given the same ELL test  accommodations on State tests for two years after they have tested Commanding (proficient) on the NYSESLAT.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The needs of special education ELL students are reviewed and implemented according to their IEPs.  “Alternate Placement”  students in special education programs receive ENL services as part of their interim service plans.  A full time language  paraprofessional is assigned to youngsters in this category.  We use instructional strategies and grade-level materials with ELL- SWDs that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development. Some instructional  strategies used with academic content are differentiation, scaffolding, repetition, labeling, using graphic organizer, peer  partnerships and having leveled libraries.  We also use many math manipulatives such as, fake money (bills and coins),  counting blocks, pattern blocks, analog clocks and counting sticks.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use TC Reading and Writing and  GoMath! grade-level materials that are aligned to the Common Core Standards.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive  environment.  ELL-SWDs are instructed using grade level content that has been modified using specific ELLs strategies.  When  scheduling these students we make sure group sizes are small and students are integrated into instruction with their grade- level peers.   The needs of special education ELL students are reviewed at monthly Pupil Personnel Committee meetings and  Annual IEP meetings.  “Alternate Placement” students in special education programs receive ENL services as part of their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      interim service plans.  A full time language paraprofessional is assigned to youngsters in this category.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) that offer support in English language arts, math and/or science in  programs.  Services are provided based upon review of data, including standardized test scores and informal  assessments.  Students who may need extra support in ELA will be provided instruction using the following programs: Wilson,  Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention and targeted Guided Reading.  Students who may need extra support in math will be  provided  with targeted fluency instruction. Students who may need extra support in other subject areas receive small group  targeted instruction from trained personnel.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Recently, PS 133 adopted the TC Reading and Writing Program and the GO Math! Program to meet and align with the Common  Core Standards.  to provide further support with the Common Core Standards, P.S. 133 will be adopting the NYC Passport  Social Studies Program this year.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  P.S. 133 offers a variety of extracurricular activities.  ELLs participate in these activities as a part of their mainstream class.  All  ELLs participate in a specialized Art Program during the school day.  ELL students also participate in a variety of programs that  incorporate the arts into our daily curriculum.  These programs include artist residencies in musical theatre.  In addition, at risk support services (i.e. Speech, Counseling) are provided to students who are identified by the Pupil Personal  Committee once parental consent is given.  AIS for Math and Science is provided to identified students.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Picture dictionaries, bilingual picture dictionaries, and Content Area picture dictionaries are available in the ENL and  mainstream classrooms to support students.  Math and Science glossaries are also provided in various languages.  The Internet  is used as a resource to help ELLs understand content using pictures or online translation sources.  The National Geographic  Reach Series, the English to a Beat! Series, leveled libraries in different genres, word/picture cards, audio material (such as  books with accompanying tapes), and graphic organizers, and Thinking Maps are also used in the ENL classroom instruction.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At PS 133, ELLs receive a variety of native language support.  Classroom teachers are encouraged to find newcomers a  "language buddy" who speaks the same language.  If not, an older student who speaks the native language may be asked to  help with any translations, etc. Students are provided the English and Native Language versions of formal assessments when  available.  Since many of the languages at PS 133 are the low incidence languages, translation services are also used to hire a  translator for State assessments if there is no one on staff that can assist  For Newcomer Spanish speaking students, the  Spanish LAB is used to assess their native language proficiency.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs at PS 133 receive their mandated time of service.  Entering and Emerging level students receive 1 unit of Stand-alone  ENL (4 periods) and 1 unit (4 periods) of Integrated ENL/ELA per week, totaling 360 minutes.  Transitioning level students  receive .5 unit of Stand-alone ENL (2 periods) and .5 unit (2 periods) of Integrated ENL/ELA per week, totaling 180  minutes.  Expanding level students receive 1 unit (4 periods) of Integrated ENL/ELA or other Content Area per week, totaling  180 minutes.  Commanding level students receive .5 unit (2 periods) of Integrated ENL/ELA or Content Area per week, totaling  90 minutes.  Stand-alone ENL pull-out classes are grouped by proficiency and grade level.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    At this time, PS 133 does not share a building.  All students are serviced here at PS 133.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Since the Principal is available during most of July and August, newly enrolled students and parents may make an appointment  for an informal orientation meeting before school begins.  The Parent Coordinator is also available to assist families.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  P.S. 133 will plan professional development opportunities to target the needs of teachers of ELLs.  Staff Development plans for  teachers will include a review of new ENL Standards, a review of the “The Practitioners’ Work Group for Accelerating English  Language Learner Student Achievement Nine Common Features of Successful Programs for ELLs,” a review of "Effective  Instruction for ELLs using an RtI Approach" and a review of the school’s Language Allocation Policy.  Staff Development will also  include the different stages of language acquisition and ENL teaching strategies to help teachers develop academic language  through content.  There is one fully certified ENL teacher at PS 133. She receives Professional Development emails from the  Division of English Language Learners and Student Support.  Professional Development workshops are chosen with discretion  to the importance of the workshop.  The ENL teacher is sent to any ELL Professional Development workshops given by the  senior ELL CPS.  The ENL teacher will provide turn-key workshops to staff on appropriate Mondays during Professional  Development time.  Professional Development opportunities will also be available for teachers on the NYCDOE website which offers a link to The  Office of English Language Learners DELLSS offers multiple resources including high quality professional development series,  Common Core-aligned lesson samples and documents, and an ever-growing video library.  P.S. 133 will also plan congruence  time between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher. This will provide opportunities to work collaboratively to evaluate  student work, data,  and plan together to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs.  Staff Development will target  classroom teachers, support personnel and administrators.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Additional support will be provided for teachers and support staff throughout the year during faculty conferences and/or  grade conferences.  To support staff when ELLs from PS 133 transfer to middle school their cumulative record folders go with  them.  A student's cumulative record folder will have their original Home Language Identification Survey, Parent Survey and  Program Selection Form and their last level of English Proficiency.  This will help staff identify who was in the ENL program  before they entered middle school.  Professional development opportunities are offered to all school staff members during Workshops , Staff Development, and  Common Preps.  These professional development events will include different strategies to assist staff members in  development of academic language through content for ELLs and oral communication with ELLs.  All teachers receive the  mandated 15% of total hours and the ENL teacher receives 50% of total hours of ELL-specific training through professional  development at staff meetings and on professional development days.   Participants, attendance, meeting dates, and agendas  are maintained by the teacher and serve as a record of this training.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher will meet with parents of ELLs annually to discuss goals of the program, language development progress and  needs, and language proficiency assessment results such as the NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL.  The ENL teacher will keep a log of  dates and times of meetings.  The ENL teacher will keep a signed attendance log for anyone who attended the annual meeting  such as the parent, classroom teacher, and an interpreter if needed.  This will ensure that each ELL student has received their  annual individual meeting with parents.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  At P.S. 133, the administration, classroom teachers, the ENL teacher and the Parent Coordinator work together to ensure that  parents are welcomed, informed and involved in their children’s education.  At the beginning of the school year, parents are  welcomed to our school at an Open School Night Orientation.  Parents meet with their child's teacher and are informed about  what their child will be learning that year and the expectations.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicole Colon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   N/A                                                                              School DBN: 26Q133  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
